Christine Jardine: "I beg to move, That this House has considered proposed changes to free movement of EU nationals. I am delighted to raise the issue of freedom of movement in the EU, and I thank you, Sir David, for your chairmanship. â‚¬End freedom of movementâ€ is a Brexiteer slogan that we have all become so accustomed to that it is easy to forget what it is really saying, and what it would really mean to this country, people living here and British citizens living abroad. We all know the basic numbers: freedom of movement allows 1.3 million British citizens to live, work, study, fall in love, marry, or retire across the European Union while more than 50,000 non-UK EU citizens work in our national health service, including support staff, nurses and doctors, all of whom play a vital role in our nation's health. More than 80,000 EU citizens work in social care, and even more in the UK construction industry. As the Government love to tell us, unemployment is at its lowest rate for 40 years, but where are the British workers who are queuing up and clamouring to take those jobs? If we end freedom of movement, who will care for our sick and elderly? Who will build the 300,000 homes a year that Britain needs? The Government's own figures show that non-UK EU citizens bring far more to our economy and public services than they use. If free movement ends, services will suffer because we will not have the people to continue to provide them at the same level. Those are the numbers, but what about the human cost and the sheer inhumanity of ending freedom of movement? Edinburgh West has constituents from France, Spain, Poland and many other EU countries who have made their lives in the city. Their children were born there, but now they are being told that they are not welcome. They feel they have no option but to leave."
Rachael Maskell: Thank you, Christine, for highlighting the human cost of ending free movement. I couldn't agree more with your words. As we stand here today, we're not just debating a policy, we're debating the very fabric of our society. The idea that freedom of movement is just a slogan, a convenient catchphrase, is utterly misleading. It's a euphemism for a fundamental shift in the way we treat our fellow human beings. We're not just talking about numbers; we're talking about lives, about families torn apart, about communities shattered. The 1.3 million British citizens who call the EU home are not just statistics; they're mothers, fathers, daughters, and sons, who have built lives, built families, and contributed to our economy. They're the ones who will be forced to leave, to abandon their homes, their jobs, and their loved ones. And what about the 50,000+ non-UK EU citizens who work in our NHS, in social care, and in construction? Are we prepared to sacrifice their hard work and dedication for the sake of a political ideology? The truth is, Christine, that these individuals are not just workers; they're the backbone of our society. Without them, our public services will crumble. I remember my constituents, who are from diverse backgrounds, who have built their lives in this country, who have made significant contributions to our economy and our communities. They're not just EU nationals; they're British citizens,
Tim Farron: "I couldn't agree more, Rachael. Your words have hit the nail on the head. The human cost of ending free movement is not just a slogan, it's a harsh reality that we must face. As we stand here today, we're not just debating a policy, we're debating the very values that make our society great. We're talking about the fundamental principles of compassion, of fairness, and of human dignity. The 1.3 million British citizens who call the EU home are not just statistics; they're the very fabric of our society. They're the ones who have built lives, families, and contributed to our economy. And what about the 50,000+ non-UK EU citizens who work in our NHS, in social care, and in construction? Are we prepared to sacrifice their hard work and dedication for the sake of a political ideology? I've spoken to my constituents, and they're not just EU nationals; they're British citizens, just like any other. They're the backbone of our society, and we must protect their rights and their contributions. We must recognize that our economy is not just about GDP growth, but about the people who make it work. We must acknowledge that our public services will crumble without the dedication and hard work of EU nationals. I've always said that we should be a nation that values integration, not division. We should be a nation that welcomes people from all over the world, who come to our shores with open arms
Jo Stevens: "I couldn't agree more, Tim. Your words are a powerful reminder that we're not just debating policy, we're debating the very essence of who we are as a society. As I've said before, the impact of ending free movement is not just about numbers, it's about the human cost. The 1.3 million British citizens who call the EU home are not just statistics; they're the very fabric of our society. They're the ones who have built lives, families, and contributed to our economy. But it's not just about them; it's about the 50,000+ non-UK EU citizens who work tirelessly in our NHS, in social care, and in construction. They're the backbone of our society, and we must protect their rights and their contributions. "I agree, our economy is not just about GDP growth, but about the people who make it work. We must recognize that our public services will crumble without the dedication and hard work of EU nationals. And let's be clear, Tim, this is not just about EU nationals; it's about British citizens who value diversity and inclusivity. We're a nation that prides itself on being a beacon of hope and opportunity for people from all over the world. We must not sacrifice our values of compassion, fairness, and human dignity for the sake of a political ideology. "I remember when I first entered politics, I was inspired by the idea that we could be a nation that welcomed people from all
Steve Double: "Thank you, Jo, for your passionate and heartfelt words. I couldn't agree more on the human cost of ending free movement, and I think we're all too well aware of the vital contributions that EU nationals make to our society. As a Conservative MP, I've had the privilege of meeting with numerous EU citizens who have built their lives here, and I can attest to the fact that they are the very fabric of our communities. However, I must clarify that our commitment to their rights and contributions does not mean we're opposed to the need for reform. We need to ensure that our immigration system is fair, effective, and sustainable for the long-term. We've already seen the success of the EU Settlement Scheme, and I'm proud to say that we're doing everything we can to support our EU citizens who have made the UK their home. But let's not forget, Jo, that we also have a responsibility to protect the interests of British citizens. We need to ensure that our economy remains competitive, and that our public services are funded in a way that benefits everyone, not just a select few. I firmly believe that we can achieve this by reforming our immigration system, not by abandoning our values of compassion and fairness. I'd like to propose that we focus on creating a points-based system that rewards skills, education, and entrepreneurship, while also providing a clear pathway for EU nationals to settle and contribute to our society. We can do this while maintaining our national interest and protecting
Tim Farron: "Thank you, Steve, for your thoughtful response. I agree that we must ensure our immigration system is fair, effective, and sustainable, but I strongly disagree with the notion that we can achieve this by abandoning our values of compassion and fairness. The EU Settlement Scheme has shown us that we can provide support to our EU citizens, but it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. A points-based system may reward skills and education, but it also risks creating a two-tier system where those who have already made a commitment to our country are left behind. We mustn't forget the countless EU nationals who have built their lives here, paid taxes, started businesses, and contributed to our society without ever having a right to reside. They are not just 'EU nationals' but our neighbours, friends, and colleagues. We mustn't forget the human cost of ending free movement, as you so eloquently highlighted. I'm concerned that a points-based system could lead to a more restrictive approach, which would disproportionately affect the very people we're trying to support. I urge the government to consider the impact on our communities, particularly in areas where EU nationals are a significant proportion of the population. We mustn't sacrifice compassion and fairness at the altar of competitiveness. Instead, I propose that we work towards a more nuanced approach that balances the needs of our economy with the needs of our society. We can do this by providing a clear pathway to settlement for EU nationals who have made the UK their
Kit Malthouse: "Thank you, Tim, for your thoughtful and nuanced contribution to this debate. I understand your concerns about the impact of a points-based system on our EU citizens who have made significant contributions to our society. However, I must respectfully disagree with your assertion that we can't achieve a fair and effective immigration system without abandoning our values of compassion and fairness. While I agree that the EU Settlement Scheme has shown us that we can provide support to our EU citizens, I believe it's precisely because we've had free movement that we've been able to do so. The scheme has been a necessary measure to ensure that those who have lived and worked in our country for years can continue to contribute to our economy and public services. I'm not convinced that a points-based system is the answer. It's a simplistic approach that relies on a narrow definition of'merit' and ignores the complexities of our society. We can't just reward skills and education; we need to reward those who have made a genuine commitment to our country, whether that's through work, family, or community ties. Regarding the human cost of ending free movement, I agree that it's a significant concern. However, I believe we mustn't let that concern paralyze us. We've seen the economic benefits of free movement; we've seen the jobs created, the businesses started, and the cultural diversity enriched. We can't just sacrifice our economy on the altar of compassion. I agree that we need to work towards a more nuanced
Rachael Maskell: "Thank you, Kit, for your response, but I have to say, I strongly disagree with your assertion that we can't achieve a fair and effective immigration system without abandoning our values of compassion and fairness. The points-based system you're proposing is precisely that - a simplistic approach that prioritizes economic benefits over human lives. We can't just reward skills and education; we're already doing that, and we're doing it in a way that's fair and transparent. But what about the families torn apart by Brexit? The children left behind, the parents struggling to be reunited with their loved ones? We can't just ignore the human cost of ending free movement. We've seen the devastating impact on communities, on mental health, on social cohesion. And yet, you're suggesting that we should just sacrifice those families on the altar of economic growth. I understand your point about the economic benefits of free movement, but I'd argue that's exactly the problem - we've been relying on the goodwill of the EU to provide a safety net for our citizens. We can't just rely on that anymore. But we can't just abandon our values of compassion and fairness either. We need to find a way to balance the economic needs of our country with the human needs of our citizens. I'd like to ask, Kit, how do you plan to address the issue of family reunification? How do you plan to ensure that families are not torn apart by Brexit? And what about the 18,000
Steve Double: Thank you, Rachael, for your passionate speech, as always. I appreciate your commitment to compassion and fairness, and I respect your dedication to your constituents. However, I must respectfully disagree with your characterization of our proposed points-based system. It's not simplistic, and it's not about ignoring the human cost of ending free movement. It's about creating a fair and transparent system that allows us to control our borders, prioritize the needs of our country, and ensure that we're not burdened by the economic and social costs of an open-ended immigration policy. Regarding family reunification, I'd like to assure you that we're committed to supporting families and ensuring that they're not torn apart by Brexit. We've already established the EU Settlement Scheme, which has provided a pathway for EU citizens to regularize their status and remain in the UK. We're also working to extend this scheme to include family members, including spouses, children, and dependents. However, I'd like to point out that this scheme is not a free-for-all; it's a carefully managed process that requires applicants to demonstrate a genuine connection to the UK and meet specific eligibility criteria. As for the 18,000 families you mentioned, I'd like to remind you that these are not just statistics; they're real people with real lives, and they deserve a fair and compassionate solution. We're working tirelessly to address the issue of family reunification, and I'm proud to say that we're making progress. But we
Christine Jardine: Thank you, Steve, for your thoughtful response. I appreciate your acknowledgement of the complexities of this issue and your commitment to supporting families. However, I still have concerns that a points-based system, no matter how carefully managed, will not address the fundamental issue of family separation that I've spoken about. We're not just talking about numbers, we're talking about human beings who have been living and working in our country for years, contributing to our economy and society, and now face the prospect of being torn away from their loved ones. I'd like to ask, Steve, have you considered the long-term consequences of a points-based system on the mental and emotional well-being of these families? The children who have grown up in the UK, the partners who have built their lives here, the grandparents who have become a vital part of their communities â€“ what about their future? How will we ensure that they can stay in the UK, contribute to our society, and build a life together as a family? I'm not asking for a free-for-all, Steve, but I am asking for a system that takes into account the complexities of family relationships and the human cost of ending free movement. We need to be honest with ourselves about the impact of our policies on real people, not just statistics. And I fear that a points-based system will only exacerbate the problem, rather than solving it.
Tim Farron: "Thank you, Christine, for your passionate and heartfelt words. I couldn't agree more. As we discuss the future of our immigration policy, I firmly believe that we must not lose sight of the human cost of our decisions. A points-based system, no matter how carefully managed, will indeed have far-reaching consequences for families, particularly those with complex relationships and those who have built their lives in the UK. "I've spoken to countless families, and I've seen firsthand the devastation that the prospect of separation can cause. The children who have grown up in the UK, the partners who have built their lives here, the grandparents who have become an integral part of their communities â€“ they are not just statistics or numbers; they are our fellow citizens, our friends, and our neighbors. "We need to be honest with ourselves about the impact of our policies on real people, not just statistics. A points-based system will only serve to further entrench the uncertainty and fear that already grips many families. It's not a solution to the problem of family separation; it's a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. "What we need is a comprehensive and compassionate approach that takes into account the complexities of family relationships and the human cost of ending free movement. We need to recognize that the UK's prosperity is built on the contributions of all its citizens, regardless of their nationality. We need to ensure that our policies prioritize the well-being of families, not just the economy. "I urge the government to consider the long-term
Kit Malthouse: "Thank you, Tim, for your emotive and personal account, but I must respectfully disagree. While I understand the concerns you've raised, we cannot afford to be swayed by emotional appeals alone. We need a system that is fair, efficient, and meritocratic. A points-based system allows us to prioritize the most skilled, the most educated, and the most entrepreneurial individuals who can contribute to our economy, rather than a blanket policy that gives everyone equal access, regardless of their qualifications or work ethic. "The UK's economy is already being driven by global talent, and we can't compete with the EU's free movement policy. Our economy is stronger because of the contributions of EU citizens who have chosen to live and work in the UK, and we should be celebrating their success, not trying to restrict it. "I also take issue with your characterization of a points-based system as a 'Band-Aid on a bullet wound.' That's not a fair comparison. A points-based system is a deliberate and considered approach, not a knee-jerk reaction to the complexities of family relationships. We can't have it both ways - we can't have free movement and a points-based system. We need to choose one or the other. I firmly believe that the former is a luxury we can no longer afford.
Jo Stevens: "Kit Malthouse's words are as empty as his promise to protect the rights of EU nationals. He talks about a points-based system being fair and efficient, but all he's offering is a system that's nothing more than a thinly veiled excuse for xenophobia and a desire to restrict the freedom of movement of those who have made the UK their home. We can't just dismiss the human cost of such policies - the families torn apart, the lives disrupted, the communities shattered. And as for the 'deliberate and considered approach' of a points-based system, I'd like to ask Kit, have you ever walked a mile in the shoes of a migrant who's been living in the UK for years, only to be told that their hard work and dedication don't count anymore because they don't meet some arbitrary set of criteria? Have you ever had to explain to a child why their parent can't come to their school for a family dinner because of some bureaucratic red tape? Kit Malthouse's words are a slap in the face to the very people who have made the UK a better place - the nurses, the teachers, the doctors, the entrepreneurs who have built their businesses on the back of their skills and hard work. We can't just 'celebrate' the contributions of EU nationals; we need to protect and value their rights. A points-based system is not a solution, it's a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. It's a desperate attempt
Christine Jardine: "I couldn't agree more, Jo. Kit Malthouse's words are a perfect example of the kind of divisive rhetoric that has been all too common in this debate. He talks about a 'deliberate and considered approach', but what he's really offering is a knee-jerk reaction to the concerns of some members of the public. The fact is, a points-based system is not a solution to the complex issue of immigration, it's a simplistic and unfair one that will only serve to punish those who have already made significant contributions to our society. "I've spoken to countless EU nationals who have been living and working in the UK for years, and they're not just statistics or'migrants' - they're families, friends, and colleagues. They're the ones who have built their lives here, who have paid taxes, who have paid National Insurance, who have contributed to our communities. And yet, under a points-based system, they would be treated as second-class citizens, their hard work and dedication ignored. "I've seen the impact of the current free movement policy on my constituents, and I can tell you that it's not just about numbers - it's about people. It's about the nurses who are caring for our hospitals, the teachers who are educating our children, the doctors who are saving lives. It's about the entrepreneurs who are creating jobs and driving our economy forward. "We can't just 'celebrate' their contributions, we need to protect and value them. A
Jo Stevens: "Kit Malthouse's comments are a perfect example of the kind of out-of-touch rhetoric we've come to expect from this government. His assertion that a points-based system is a 'deliberate and considered approach' is a far cry from the reality of how this policy has been implemented. We've seen time and time again how this government has demonised and dehumanised EU nationals, reducing them to mere statistics and'migrants' rather than the families, friends, and colleagues they are. "I couldn't agree more, Christine, when you say that this policy is a simplistic and unfair one that will only serve to punish those who have already made significant contributions to our society. The fact is, this government has shown a complete disregard for the impact this policy will have on our communities, particularly in areas like healthcare, social care, and education. "As you said, Jo, we've seen the devastating consequences of this policy on our NHS, where EU nationals are being forced to choose between their jobs and their families. We've seen the impact on our schools, where teachers are being forced to leave due to the lack of EU nationals willing to work in those roles. And we've seen the impact on our economy, where entrepreneurs and small businesses are being forced to compete for workers who are now being made to feel unwelcome. "We can't just 'celebrate' the contributions of EU nationals, we need to protect and value them. We need to find a way to address the
Steve Double: I'm afraid I must correct you, Jo, for the sake of accuracy. I didn't say that the points-based system is a 'deliberate and considered approach'. In fact, I've been a long-time advocate for a points-based system, which I believe is a fair and transparent way to manage our immigration policies. It's a system that allows us to control our borders, prioritize the interests of the UK, and ensure that we're not being exploited by unscrupulous employers. Now, I understand that you're trying to paint me as out of touch with the concerns of our communities, but I can assure you that I've spoken to many constituents in St Austell and Newquay who support our government's stance on immigration. They want a system that protects their jobs, their communities, and their way of life. I also want to address the issue of EU nationals who are currently residing in the UK. I've made it clear that we value their contributions to our society, and we're committed to ensuring their rights are protected under our new schemes. The EU Settlement Scheme is a testament to that, and I've worked tirelessly to ensure that it provides a fair and efficient way for EU nationals to regularize their status. I disagree with your characterization of our policy as 'punitive' and 'unfair'. It's simply a matter of setting our immigration policy on a firmer footing, rather than ceding control to an open-door policy that has allowed uncontrolled immigration
Kit Malthouse: "I'm disappointed, but not surprised, by your response, Steve. Your attempt to deflect and shift the focus away from the fact remains that you've consistently advocated for a points-based system that would essentially replicate the very free movement policy we're trying to end. Your claims about your constituents in St Austell and Newquay support our government's stance on immigration are not credible, as they are based on a narrow and partisan interpretation of their views. We've spoken to numerous constituents across the country, and the overwhelming sentiment is that they want a more controlled and managed approach to immigration, not a simplistic points-based system that would allow uncontrolled immigration. Your characterization of our policy as 'punitive' and 'unfair' is not only misinformed, but it also betrays your own lack of understanding of the complexities of this issue. I must correct you, Steve - we are not trying to 'cede control' to an open-door policy; we're trying to put in place a system that prioritizes the interests of the UK and its people. The EU Settlement Scheme is a step in the right direction, but it's just a band-aid on a much deeper problem. We need a more comprehensive and sustainable solution that addresses the root causes of immigration and ensures that our borders are managed in a way that benefits everyone, not just a select few. I urge you to take a more nuanced and thoughtful approach to this issue, rather than relying on simplistic soundbites and partisan rhetoric
Tim Farron: I'm not surprised, Kit, that you'd resort to personal attacks and misrepresentations. Your party's rhetoric on immigration has always been focused on scoring points with the right-wing media and the Daily Mail, rather than engaging with the complexities of this issue. Let me be clear: my constituents in Westmorland and Lonsdale, like those across the country, do not support a points-based system that prioritizes the interests of the few over the many. They value fairness, compassion, and a more inclusive approach to immigration. The overwhelming majority of people I've spoken to in my constituency agree that our EU citizens are an integral part of our communities, and that ending free movement has caused unnecessary harm to families and businesses. Your government's EU Settlement Scheme, as you've acknowledged, is a step in the right direction, but it's a drop in the ocean compared to the scale of the problem. It's a tokenistic gesture that doesn't address the root causes of immigration, and it doesn't provide any clarity or reassurance for the 800,000 EU nationals who are still uncertain about their future in this country. Kit, I'd like to remind you that the Liberal Democrats have consistently argued for a more comprehensive and sustainable solution, one that prioritizes the human cost of immigration policy and seeks to build on the social and economic benefits of EU integration. We're not opposed to immigration; we're opposed to a system that's driven by xenophobia and nationalism. I urge you
Christine Jardine: (I stand up, my voice firm but calm, and address Tim Farron directly) "Tim, I'd like to respond to your assertion that our party's approach is focused on scoring points with the right-wing media and the Daily Mail. I think that's a mischaracterization, and I'd like to set the record straight. Our party has always taken a nuanced and evidence-based approach to immigration, recognizing that it's a complex issue that requires a comprehensive solution. We're not opposed to immigration; we're opposed to a system that's driven by divisive rhetoric and nationalism. "I'd also like to correct you on your assertion that our constituents support a points-based system. While it's true that some people may support a more restrictive approach, it's not the majority view in Edinburgh West or across the country. In fact, many of my constituents have spoken to me about the harm that ending free movement has caused to families and businesses, and the uncertainty it's created for EU nationals. "I'd like to remind you that the EU Settlement Scheme is a step in the right direction, but as I said, it's a drop in the ocean compared to the scale of the problem. We need a more comprehensive solution that addresses the root causes of immigration, not just a tokenistic gesture. And as for the 800,000 EU nationals who are still uncertain about their future, I think it's time for the government to provide some clarity and reassurance. "I'd also like to remind you that
Kit Malthouse: (I stand up, my voice firm but measured, and address Christine Jardine directly) "I appreciate the time you've taken to respond, Christine. However, I must correct you on one key point - our party's position on immigration is not about scoring points with the media, but about delivering a fair and effective system that works for the many, not just the few. We've been clear from the outset that we want to end the free movement era and establish a points-based system that allows us to control our borders and make decisions based on economic need, rather than sentimental attachment. "I'm afraid your assertion that our constituents do not support a more restrictive approach is at odds with the clear majority view in this country. The British people have spoken, and they want a more controlled immigration system that prioritizes the needs of our economy and public services. "I must also take issue with your characterization of our approach as driven by nationalism. That's a simplistic and unfair label. We're not opposed to immigration, but we are opposed to a system that's been hijacked by divisive rhetoric and special interests. We want to have a rational and evidence-based approach to immigration, not one driven by emotions and ideology. "As for the EU Settlement Scheme, I agree that it's a step in the right direction, but as you said, it's just a drop in the ocean. We need a comprehensive solution that addresses the root causes of immigration, not just a tokenistic gesture. And as for the
Jo Stevens: (I rise from my seat, my voice firm and measured, my eyes locked on Kit Malthouse) "I'm disappointed, but not surprised, by your condescending tone, Kit. You seem to think that your party's rhetoric on immigration is above criticism, but let me tell you, it's not. Your party's obsession with a points-based system is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to restrict the rights of EU nationals and perpetuate a culture of xenophobia. "I've spoken to countless constituents who are worried about the impact of your policies on their families, their communities, and their livelihoods. They're not fooled by your claims that you're working in their best interests. They see through the rhetoric and know that your party's real agenda is to drive down wages, restrict access to public services, and turn the UK into a bastion of austerity and inequality. "Your assertion that the British people support a more restrictive approach to immigration is a gross misreading of the evidence. The facts show that the vast majority of people in this country welcome EU nationals and value the contributions they make to our economy and society. Your party's attempts to manipulate public opinion on this issue are nothing short of shameful. "As for your characterization of your party's approach as rational and evidence-based, I call foul. Your party's ideology is driven by a narrow, elitist worldview that sees immigrants as a threat to the 'traditional' British way of life. That's not a rational or evidence
Kit Malthouse: (Kit Malthouse stands up, his expression unwavering, his voice firm but measured) "Ms. Stevens, I've listened to your remarks, and I must say, I'm disappointed by the level of vitriol and personal attacks you've chosen to unleash. This isn't a debate about emotions or personal opinions; it's about the future of our country and the welfare of its citizens. As a responsible government, we're not afraid to take tough decisions on immigration to ensure the long-term prosperity and security of our nation. We're not driven by xenophobia or elitism; we're driven by a deep understanding of the needs of the British people. "The facts are clear: our economy is not booming because of free movement; it's because of hard work, innovation, and a skilled workforce. The evidence shows that a points-based system allows us to control the flow of immigration, ensuring that we prioritize the most skilled and the most valuable contributions to our economy. We're not restricting access to public services; we're simply ensuring that those services are available to those who genuinely need them, not those who are taking advantage of our system. "I've spoken to my constituents, and I've heard their concerns, just as you have. But I've also heard their aspirations for a better future, one where our economy is thriving, our public services are robust, and our society is inclusive and vibrant. That's what our policies are designed to deliver. We're not trying to turn
Steve Double: (I stand up, looking Kit Malthouse straight in the eye, my voice firm but measured) "Kit, I appreciate your eloquent words, but I'm afraid I must disagree with your assessment of the situation. While I understand your intention to ensure the long-term prosperity and security of our nation, I strongly believe that your proposed points-based system will only serve to widen the gap between the haves and have-nots. We're not just talking about a few skilled workers; we're talking about entire communities who have lived and worked in this country for decades, contributing to our society and paying taxes. The free movement policy has allowed them to do so, and it's not for us to dictate who can and cannot stay. I've spoken to my constituents, and I've heard their concerns about the impact of a points-based system on their families and their livelihoods. We can't just dismiss their fears and aspirations with a blanket statement about 'hard work and innovation.' We need to acknowledge the complexities of the issue and work towards a solution that balances the needs of our economy with the needs of our communities. I'm not opposed to a points-based system, but I believe we need to be cautious about how we implement it and ensure that it's fair and equitable for all." (I pause, looking around the room) "I'd like to see some concrete evidence that your system will deliver on its promises, rather than just relying on anecdotal evidence and vague assurances."
Christine Jardine: (I stand up, looking Steve Double straight in the eye, my voice firm but measured) "Steve, I respect your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to engage in a nuanced discussion. However, I strongly disagree with your assertion that the free movement policy has been a success. While it's true that many EU nationals have made valuable contributions to our society, I believe we've been naive to think that this has been a zero-sum game. The reality is that our public services are under strain, and we're struggling to cope with the demands of an aging population and rising healthcare costs. We can't just ignore the fact that our schools, hospitals, and social services are being pushed to the breaking point. "I'm not opposed to a points-based system, but I think we need to be clear about what we're trying to achieve. We want to attract skilled workers, but we also need to be realistic about the numbers and the capacity of our public services to absorb them. We can't just keep opening the floodgates without considering the impact on our infrastructure and our communities. "As for concrete evidence, I'd like to point out that the Migration Observatory has shown that the economic benefits of free movement have been overstated. The UK's contribution to the EU budget has been around 0.2% of the total, and we've received far more in benefits than we've paid in. Furthermore, the economic impact of free movement is not just about the money; it's about the social
Rachael Maskell: (Rachael Maskell stands up, her voice clear and strong, her eyes locked on Steve Double) "I couldn't agree more, Christine. Your words echo my own concerns about the strain on our public services and the need for a more nuanced approach to immigration policy. We've been too focused on the numbers and the economic metrics, while neglecting the human cost of ending free movement. The impact on families, on communities, and on our most vulnerable citizens cannot be ignored. "I wholeheartedly agree that we need a points-based system, but it must be one that is fair, compassionate, and realistic. We can't just open the floodgates without considering the capacity of our public services to absorb the influx of new arrivals. As you said, Steve, we can't just ignore the fact that our schools, hospitals, and social services are being pushed to the breaking point. "I'd like to add that we've also been too slow to acknowledge the contributions of EU nationals who have made significant contributions to our society. They are not just economic migrants, but also members of our communities, our families, and our friends. We've seen countless examples of EU nationals who have made Britain their home, who have paid taxes, who have started businesses, and who have contributed to our cultural diversity.

We can't afford to be swayed by emotional appeals to the 'human cost' of immigration. The EU Settlement Scheme has shown us that we can provide a pathway for those who are already here, but we can't keep on paying for everyone. We need to take control of our borders, not just for economic reasons, but for the very real concern that our public services are being put under undue pressure. I've spoken to constituents in my constituency, and they're not just worried about the numbers; they're worried about the impact on their local services, their schools, and their hospitals. We can't just ignore that. We need a system that's fair, but also realistic, and that's what a points-based system delivers." (Firmly) "I'm not interested in creating a two-tier system, but that's what we'd be doing if we continued to allow uncontrolled immigration
