Christine Jardine:  I beg to move, That this House has considered proposed changes to free movement of EU nationals. I am delighted to raise the issue of freedom of movement in the EU, and I thank you, Sir David, for your chairmanship. â‚¬End freedom of movementâ€ is a Brexiteer slogan that we have all become so accustomed to that it is easy to forget what it is really saying, and what it would really mean to this country, people living here and British citizens living abroad. We all know the basic numbers: freedom of movement allows 1.3 million British citizens to live, work, study, fall in love, marry, or retire across the European Union while more than 50,000 non-UK EU citizens work in our national health service, including support staff, nurses and doctors, all of whom play a vital role in our nation's health. More than 80,000 EU citizens work in social care, and even more in the UK construction industry. As the Government love to tell us, unemployment is at its lowest rate for 40 years, but where are the British workers who are queuing up and clamouring to take those jobs? If we end freedom of movement, who will care for our sick and elderly? Who will build the 300,000 homes a year that Britain needs? The Government's own figures show that non-UK EU citizens bring far more to our economy and public services than they use. If free movement ends, services will suffer because we will not have the people to continue to provide them at the same level. Those are the numbers, but what about the human cost and the sheer inhumanity of ending freedom of movement? Edinburgh West has constituents from France, Spain, Poland and many other EU countries who have made their lives in the city. Their children were born there, but now they are being told that they are not welcome. They feel they have no option but to leave.
Tim Farron: Mr. Farron will speak, and I will speak as a representative of a country that has been part of the European Union for nearly 50 years. We have been part of a great and wonderful partnership, and I am proud to be part of it. I am proud to be a Liberal Democrat, and I am proud to be a Member of Parliament. I will never support the destruction of our relationship with the European Union. The Government's plans to end free movement are not just about the EU nationals living in the UK; they are about the British people who have been given the opportunity to live and work in the EU. They are about the people who have chosen to come here because of our values, our culture, our language and our history. They are about the people who have made this country their home and have contributed to our economy and our society. The Government's plans are not just about the EU nationals; they are about the British people who are being denied the opportunity to live, work and study in the EU. They are about the people who are being told that they are not welcome. They are about the people who are being denied the right to live and work in the EU because of the Government's decision. I say to the Government that this is a betrayal of the values that we hold dear. It is a betrayal of the values of freedom, of equality, of justice and of human rights. It is a betrayal of the values of the European Union, which is the
Kit Malthouse: I must say, I'm disappointed, but not surprised, by the level of emotional rhetoric that has been displayed by the Liberal Democrats today. This is not a debate about the values of freedom, equality, justice, and human rights; it's a debate about the future of our country and the future of our nation. The future of our nation is not about the freedom of EU nationals to live and work in the UK; it's about the freedom of the British people to make their own decisions about their own country. The British people have spoken, and they have chosen to leave the EU. We must respect their decision and we must take control of our own destiny. The Liberal Democrats' opposition to this is not about the values of the EU; it's about their opposition to the will of the British people. They are trying to undermine the democratic process and to impose their own views on the country. I say to the Liberal Democrats that this is not the way to do it. We will not be swayed by emotional appeals and we will not be deterred by the opposition of the Liberal Democrats. We will get on with the job of implementing the Brexit process and we will make sure that we do it in a way that is fair, that is just, and that is in the best interests of the British people.
Tim Farron: Kit Malthouse's words are a stark reminder that the Conservative Party's Brexit agenda is not just about the economy, it's about the politics of the heart. It's about the politics of division and the politics of fear. He talks about the British people's decision to leave the EU, but he forgets that that decision was made on a lie. The lie was told by a Leave campaign that promised that leaving the EU would be painless, that it would be a chance for the UK to regain control of our borders and our laws. But the truth is, it will be a disaster for the people who are most vulnerable in our society. It will be a disaster for the NHS, for social care, for our schools, for our universities, and for our economy. The truth is, the EU is not the enemy, it's a partner. We have benefited from the EU for decades, and we will continue to benefit from it for decades to come. But the Conservative Party's Brexit agenda is not about the benefits of the EU, it's about the power of the few. It's about the power of the wealthy and the powerful, and the power of the Conservative Party. The Liberal Democrats will not be swayed by the politics of the heart, we will be guided by the principles of justice, equality, and human rights. We will fight for the rights of EU nationals, we will fight for the rights of the most vulnerable in our society, and we will fight for
Rachael Maskell: I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's speech, and I must say that I am disappointed, but not surprised, by the Conservative Party's continued refusal to engage with the reality of the situation. The reality is that the Government's Brexit deal is a disaster for the people of York Central and for the people of the UK. It is a disaster for the NHS, for social care, for our schools, for our universities, and for our economy. The Government's decision to leave the EU is a disaster for the people of York Central, and I will not stand idly by while they continue to undermine the rights of EU nationals living in our city. I am proud to have represented York Central for many years, and I have seen firsthand the impact of the EU's free movement on our city. It has brought prosperity, it has brought diversity, and it has brought opportunity. The Conservative Party's decision to leave the EU will take away all of those things. The Government's decision to leave the EU is a disaster for the people of York Central, and I will continue to fight for the rights of EU nationals living in our city. I will continue to fight for the rights of the most vulnerable in our society, and I will continue to fight for the future of our city. The Liberal Democrats will not be swayed by the politics of the heart, we will be guided by the principles of justice, equality, and human rights. We will fight for the rights of EU nationals
Jo Stevens: I'm glad that the hon. Gentleman has finally acknowledged the devastating impact of the Conservative Government's Brexit deal on our city. However, his words ring hollow, as his Government has spent years campaigning on a promise to protect the rights of EU nationals, only to abandon those very same people once in power. The fact is, the Conservative Party's Brexit deal is a betrayal of the people of York Central, and it is a betrayal of the people of the UK.  The hon. Gentleman talks about the economy, but he ignores the fact that the free movement of people has been a key driver of economic growth in our city. It has brought in skilled workers, entrepreneurs and businesses, and has helped to create prosperity for our communities. The Conservative Government's decision to leave the EU will take away all of those benefits, and it will leave our city and our country poorer, not richer.  The hon. Gentleman also talks about the NHS, social care, schools and universities, but he forgets that the Conservative Party's Brexit deal has already had a devastating impact on those very same services. The NHS is struggling to cope with the loss of EU staff, social care is being stretched to the breaking point, and our schools and universities are facing a shortage of skilled workers.  But the most worrying thing is that the Conservative Government's Brexit deal is not just a disaster for our city, but it is also a disaster for the most vulnerable in our society. It is a disaster for EU nationals who
Steve Double: I will not stand by idly while the hon. Gentleman spreads misinformation and half-truths about the Conservative Government's Brexit deal. The hon. Gentleman is wrong to say that the deal is a betrayal of EU nationals. The EU Settlement Scheme, which was introduced by the previous Labour Government, ensured that EU citizens who have been living in the UK for five years or more can stay and work here. It is a testament to the Conservative Government's commitment to treating EU nationals with dignity and respect. The hon. Gentleman also misrepresents the facts about the economy. The free movement of people has not been a key driver of economic growth in York Central. In fact, the economic growth in the region is driven by a range of factors, including the growth of the service sector and the investment in infrastructure. The hon. Gentleman's assertion that the Conservative Government's Brexit deal will take away the economic benefits of free movement is simply not supported by the facts. As for the impact on the NHS, social care, schools and universities, I have already said that the Conservative Government is taking steps to address the challenges posed by the free movement of people. We are recruiting more doctors and nurses from the EU, and we are providing additional funding to support the NHS and social care services. The hon. Gentleman's suggestion that the Conservative Government is abandoning the people of York Central is simply not true. We are committed to supporting the people of York Central and the rest of the country,
Kit Malthouse: I say to the hon. Gentleman, that is a classic case of Labour spin and revisionism. He is trying to rewrite history to suit his party's agenda. The fact is, the free movement of people was a policy that was introduced by the Labour Government, and it was a policy that they have now abandoned. The hon. Gentleman is trying to pretend that the Conservative Government is somehow betraying EU nationals, but the truth is that we are ending the free movement of people, not continuing it. This is a matter of national sovereignty, and it is a matter of the UK's ability to control its own borders. The hon. Gentleman can try to spin it however he likes, but the fact remains that the free movement of people is a policy that has been widely abused, and it is a policy that has put a huge strain on our public services. We are ending it because we want to ensure that our public services are not overwhelmed by an influx of people who are not contributing to the economy or paying their way. We are ending free movement because we want to ensure that our public services are funded by people who are contributing to the economy, not by people who are not paying their way. The hon. Gentleman can try to pretend that this is some kind of betrayal, but it is simply common sense.
Jo Stevens: I must correct the hon. Gentleman's history. The free movement of people was not a policy that was introduced by the Labour Government, but it was a policy that was negotiated and agreed to by the UK Government, as part of the 2004 EU accession treaty, and it was implemented by the Labour Government, but also the Conservative Government. The fact is, the free movement of people was a policy that was introduced to benefit the UK economy and to bring in highly skilled workers, and it was a policy that was widely supported by businesses and employers.  The hon. Gentleman's assertion that it has been widely abused and put a huge strain on public services is simply not borne out by the facts. The evidence shows that the free movement of people has been a net positive for the UK economy, and that it has helped to drive economic growth and create jobs.  The hon. Gentleman's argument that we need to end free movement to control our borders is a classic example of a simplistic and populist approach to immigration policy. It is not that simple, and it is not that easy to control the flow of people into the UK. We need a more nuanced and evidence-based approach to immigration policy, one that takes into account the needs of our economy and our society, rather than just trying to control the number of people who come into the country.  The hon. Gentleman's assertion that we are ending free movement because we want to ensure that our public services are funded by people who are contributing
Tim Farron: I rise to correct the hon. Gentleman's assertion that the free movement of people was introduced by the Labour Government. It was, as I said, a policy that was negotiated and agreed to by the UK Government, as part of the 2004 EU accession treaty. I am proud to say that the Labour Government, and indeed the Conservative Government that followed, implemented it. It was a policy that was widely supported by businesses and employers, and it has been a net positive for the UK economy. The hon. Gentleman's assertion that it has been widely abused and put a huge strain on public services is simply not borne out by the facts. The evidence shows that the free movement of people has been a driving force behind the UK's economic growth and job creation. It has brought in highly skilled workers, entrepreneurs, and small business owners who have made a significant contribution to our economy. The hon. Gentleman's simplistic and populist approach to immigration policy is not good enough. We need a more nuanced and evidence-based approach that takes into account the needs of our economy and our society, rather than just trying to control the number of people who come into the country. We need to ensure that our public services are funded by people who are contributing to our economy, but we also need to ensure that our public services are funded by people who are contributing to our society, including our public services. The hon. Gentleman's assertion that we are ending free movement because we want to ensure that our
Steve Double: I think that is a bit of a straw man, because I have never said that we are ending free movement because we want to ensure that our public services are funded by people who are contributing to our society. What we are doing is ending free movement because we want to ensure that our public services are funded by people who are contributing to our economy. We want to ensure that we are not clogging up the NHS with doctors and nurses who are not contributing to the economy. We want to ensure that our schools are not overcrowded with teachers who are not contributing to the economy. We want to ensure that our universities are not overburdened with students who are not contributing to the economy. That is what we are trying to achieve, and that is what the evidence suggests we need to do. The hon. Gentleman's assertion that we are ending free movement because we want to restrict the movement of people who are making a positive contribution to our society is simply not borne out by the facts. The evidence suggests that the vast majority of migrants are not making a positive contribution to our society. They are taking jobs from British workers, they are taking housing from British families, and they are putting a strain on our public services. We need to be honest with the British people about what is happening here, and we need to be honest about what we are trying to achieve.
Tim Farron: I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's argument that we are ending free movement because we want to restrict the movement of people who are making a positive contribution to our society. The evidence is clear: the vast majority of migrants are not making a positive contribution to our society. They are taking jobs from British workers, they are taking housing from British families, and they are putting a strain on our public services. We need to be honest with the British people about what is happening here, and we need to be honest about what we are trying to achieve. The hon. Gentleman talks about the economy, but the economy is not just about the number of people who are working. It is about the quality of those people. It is about the contribution that they make to our society. We are not just talking about the economy; we are talking about the social fabric of our country. We are talking about the kind of society we want to be. We want to be a society that is inclusive, that is compassionate, and that is fair. We want to be a society that welcomes people who are coming here to contribute, not just to the economy, but to our society as a whole. We want to be a society that is welcoming to people who are coming here to make a positive contribution, not just to the economy, but to our society. That is what we are trying to achieve, and that is what we will continue to fight for.
Steve Double: I think the hon. Gentleman has misspoken. The fact is, the vast majority of migrants do make a positive contribution to our society. They are contributing to our economy, they are contributing to our culture, and they are contributing to our public services. The hon. Gentleman's assertion that they are taking jobs from British workers is simply not supported by the evidence. In fact, studies have shown that migrants are more likely to start their own businesses and create new jobs than British-born workers. They are also more likely to pay more taxes and contribute to our public services than British-born workers. The hon. Gentleman's rhetoric about the social fabric of our country is emotive, but it is also misleading. The fact is, we are ending free movement because it is unsustainable. It is unsustainable for our public services, it is unsustainable for our economy, and it is unsustainable for our country. We need to be honest with the British people about what is happening here, and we need to be honest about what we are trying to achieve. We are not trying to restrict the movement of people who are making a positive contribution to our society. We are trying to ensure that our country is sustainable, that our public services are sustainable, and that our economy is sustainable. That is what we are trying to achieve, and that is what we will continue to fight for.
"Speaker:  Before I let the Right Honourable Member continue, I must inform the House of a major development: 
    
 The US President has just confirmed the decision to impose a 25% tariff on imports coming from the UK and EU. 
    I now invite Members to continue the debate in light of this development.
    "
Rachael Maskell: Mr Speaker, this is a truly shocking development. This is not just a trade policy decision; it is a clear example of the consequences of the Government's reckless approach to Brexit. The Prime Minister has been clear that she wants to pursue a hard Brexit, and now we see the reality of that approach. This tariff is a slap in the face to the hardworking people of York Central and across the country. It is a slap in the face to the businesses that have been struggling since the Brexit vote, and to the farmers who are already feeling the pinch of the tariffs imposed on their exports.      The Prime Minister and her Government have been so focused on the short-term political gains of Brexit that they have ignored the very real economic consequences. This tariff will hit our farmers hard, as it will make their exports more expensive and less competitive. It will hit our businesses hard, as it will increase costs and prices for consumers. And it will hit our economy hard, as it will reduce our exports and slow down growth.      The Prime Minister has promised a Brexit dividend, but I do not see that dividend being delivered. Instead, we are seeing a Brexit tax, a tariff that will harm our economy and our people. I urge the Government to reconsider their approach to Brexit and to work with the EU to find a better solution. We need a deal that is in the interests of our country, not just the interests of the Prime Minister and her party. We need a deal that is in the interests
Steve Double: Mr. Speaker, I rise to address this shocking development. The imposition of tariffs on our exports is a devastating blow to our economy, and it is a clear example of the Prime Minister's Government's catastrophic approach to Brexit. We are not just talking about trade policy; we are talking about the livelihoods of hardworking people across this country. The farmers who are already struggling to make ends meet will be hit hardest by these tariffs. They will be forced to pay more to export their goods, and their businesses will be put at risk. The businesses that have been struggling since the Brexit vote will be hit even harder. They will be forced to pay more to import goods and to pay higher prices for their customers. And the consumers will be hit too. They will be forced to pay more for the goods they need and want. The Prime Minister and her Government have been so focused on the short-term political gains of Brexit that they have ignored the very real economic consequences. This tariff is not a Brexit dividend; it is a Brexit tax. It is a tax on our economy, on our people, and on our businesses. I urge the Government to reconsider their approach to Brexit and to work with the EU to find a better solution. We need a deal that is in the interests of our country, not just the interests of the Prime Minister and her party. We need a deal that will protect our economy, our businesses, and our people.
Rachael Maskell: I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman. The UK's departure from the EU's customs union and single market has created the need for a new trade agreement. It is not the UK's place to dictate the terms of the agreement; that is what the EU's future relationship with the UK should be about. The UK's departure from the customs union has created a trade deficit, and it is the responsibility of the Government to address that deficit. It is not the responsibility of the EU to fix it. The UK has a duty to negotiate a trade agreement that is in its own interests. The hon. Gentleman's approach is to try to reverse the process and to try to rejoin the customs union. That is not the right approach. We need to move forward and to negotiate a new trade agreement that is in the UK's interests. I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman's approach. The UK needs to take control of its own trade policy. We need to negotiate a trade agreement that is in our interests. We need to be in control of our own trade policy. We need to take control of our own economy. The hon. Gentleman's approach is to try to reverse the process and to try to rejoin the customs union. That is not the right approach. We need to move forward and to negotiate a new trade agreement that is in the UK's interests. We need to be in control of our own trade policy. We need to take control of
Christine Jardine: I disagree with my hon. Friend's assessment of the situation. The UK's departure from the customs union and single market has created a number of challenges, but it has also presented an opportunity for us to create a more level playing field and to ensure that our trade agreements are in the best interests of British businesses and workers. The UK is not a small player in the global economy, and we should not be dictated to by the EU on our trade policy. We need to take control of our own trade policy, not just for the sake of our economy, but also to ensure that we are not being taken advantage of by other countries. I am concerned about the impact of the current situation on our farmers, our businesses, and our workers. We need to ensure that we are not losing out on trade opportunities because of the UK's decision to leave the customs union. The UK has a duty to negotiate a trade agreement that is in its own interests, and we should be proud of that. We should be proud of the fact that we are taking control of our own trade policy and that we are not being dictated to by the EU. We should be proud of the fact that we are not just a vassal state, but a sovereign nation that is able to make its own decisions about its trade policy.
Kit Malthouse: I must respectfully disagree with my hon. Friend's assertion that we should be dictated to by the EU on our trade policy. The truth is, the EU's customs union and single market have long been a barrier to free trade and competition for British businesses. They have stifled our ability to make our own decisions about our trade policy, and they have allowed the EU to impose its own rules and regulations on us without any say in the matter. We have been told that we can only do business with the EU if we follow its rules and regulations, and if we comply with its decisions. That is not the way a sovereign nation should operate. We should be proud of our ability to take control of our own trade policy, to negotiate our own agreements, and to make our own decisions about the trade deals we enter into. My hon. Friend's assertion that the UK is not a small player in the global economy is correct, but that does not mean we should be dictated to by the EU. We should be proud of our ability to stand up for ourselves and to negotiate our own trade agreements, not just because we are a small player, but because we are a sovereign nation with our own interests and our own voice. We should be proud of the fact that we are taking control of our own trade policy, not just for the sake of our economy, but for the sake of our national sovereignty.
Steve Double: I wholeheartedly agree with my hon. Friend's assessment of the EU's customs union and single market. They have been a significant obstacle to free trade and competition for British businesses, and it is time we take control of our own trade policy. We must not be dictated to by the EU on our trade decisions. We should be proud of our ability to negotiate our own agreements, to make our own decisions about the trade deals we enter into, and to stand up for ourselves in the global economy. The notion that we are a small player in the global economy is a myth; we are a significant player, and we should be proud of that. We should not be bound by the EU's rules and regulations; instead, we should be free to make our own decisions about our trade policy. I firmly believe that our new trade agreements will be better for British businesses and for the British people, and we will be able to negotiate on our own terms, not just because we are a small player, but because we are a sovereign nation with our own interests and our own voice.
Christine Jardine: I disagree, and I must say I find it quite astonishing that the hon. Gentleman is so dismissive of the contributions that EU nationals have made to our society, particularly in my constituency. They have been here for decades, paying taxes, working, and contributing to our economy. They are not a burden, but a vital part of our communities. To suggest that we should be taking away their rights and freedoms is not only wrong, but it is also economically illiterate.   We are not just talking about the economy; we are talking about people's lives. The notion that we should be free to negotiate our own trade deals is not as straightforward as it seems. The reality is that our economy is deeply intertwined with the EU's. We are part of a global economy, and our trade relationships are not just with the EU, but with the rest of the world.   Furthermore, the idea that we should be taking control of our trade policy is a simplistic one. It is not as simple as just saying, "We will do it our way." The reality is that we are part of a global economy, and our trade relationships are complex and multifaceted. We need to consider the impact of our actions on our economy, on our businesses, and on our communities.   I am not naive; I know that the EU has its own rules and regulations. But to suggest that we should be tearing them up, without any consideration for the impact on our economy and our people,
Tim Farron: I must say, I am disappointed, but not surprised, by the hon. Gentleman's response. He seems to be stuck in a mindset that believes that the only way to do things is the way he does them, and that is not good enough. We need a more nuanced approach, one that takes into account the complexity of the issue and the impact on our economy and our people. The hon. Gentleman talks about the economy, but he does not seem to care about the people who will be affected by his policies. He talks about the benefits of EU membership, but he does not seem to care about the benefits of EU membership for the people who are living in the UK.   The reality is that the hon. Gentleman's policies will have a devastating impact on our economy and our communities. He is not just talking about the economy; he is talking about people's lives. The notion that we should be taking away the rights and freedoms of EU nationals is not just wrong; it is also economically illiterate. We are not just talking about the economy; we are talking about people's lives. The hon. Gentleman's policies will have a devastating impact on our communities, particularly on the communities that rely on the contributions of EU nationals. I will not support the hon. Gentleman's policies, because they are not in the best interests of our country or our people.
Kit Malthouse: I'm afraid the hon. Gentleman has once again demonstrated his complete lack of understanding of the issues at stake here. His words are full of rhetoric, but they are devoid of substance. He talks about the economy, but he does not know the first thing about the economy. He talks about people's lives, but he does not care about the lives of ordinary people. The truth is, we need to take control of our borders, and that means ending free movement. It is not just about the EU nationals; it is about our own citizens. We need to make sure that we are not overwhelmed by a tidal wave of migrants who are not contributing to our economy, but are instead taking jobs away from our own citizens. The hon. Gentleman says that my policies will have a devastating impact on our communities, but I say that it is his policies that will have a devastating impact on our communities. His policies will lead to a two-tier society, where those who are born here are better off than those who are not. That is not the Britain I want to see. I will not be swayed by the hon. Gentleman's empty rhetoric. I will continue to fight for the rights of British citizens, and for the future of our country.
Christine Jardine: Kit Malthouse's words are not just empty rhetoric, but a stark reminder of the consequences of his approach to Brexit. He talks about taking control of our borders, but what does that really mean? Does it mean that he will prioritize the interests of a select few, or the many? The truth is, ending free movement will have a devastating impact on our communities, particularly on the most vulnerable among us. It will lead to a two-tier society, where those who are born here are better off than those who are not, as he so callously suggested.  But what about the EU nationals who have made Scotland their home? What about the families, the businesses, the contributions they make to our economy? Do we really want to turn our backs on them? I do not. I will not stand idly by while Kit Malthouse tries to demonize a group of people who are already contributing to our society. We need a more nuanced approach, one that takes into account the complexities of our economy and the needs of our communities. We need to work together to build a better future for everyone, not just a select few.  I urge the hon. Gentleman to think about the human cost of his policies. Think about the families who will be torn apart, the businesses that will suffer, and the communities that will be left behind. We need a government that puts people first, not just those who are born here. We need a government that values diversity, that values inclusivity
Steve Double: I am deeply disappointed that the hon. Lady is still refusing to acknowledge the will of the British people. The British people voted for Brexit, and it is our duty to deliver it. We cannot continue to be held hostage by the EU's free movement policies, which have been exploited by traffickers and those seeking to exploit our country. The hon. Lady's words are nothing but a thinly veiled attempt to justify the continued exploitation of our country. We will not be swayed by emotional appeals to the heart. We will not be swayed by the rhetoric of the EU. We will take control of our borders, and we will make our own decisions about who comes into our country. That is what the British people want. We will not be lectured to by the EU about the importance of diversity and inclusivity. We will make our own decisions about who we want to welcome into our country. And we will do it on the basis of merit, not on the basis of where someone was born. The EU Settlement Scheme has shown that we can welcome EU nationals into our country, and we will continue to do so. But we will not be held hostage by the EU's free movement policies. We will take back control of our borders, and we will make our own decisions about who comes into our country. That is what the British people want.
Rachael Maskell: I am deeply disappointed by the hon. Gentleman's response. He is still stuck in the past, and he is refusing to listen to the concerns of the British people. We are not just talking about the rights of EU nationals; we are talking about the rights of the most vulnerable people in our society. We are talking about the rights of unaccompanied minors, who are being torn from their families and left to fend for themselves in our country. We are talking about the rights of those who have been trafficked and exploited in our country, and who are now being forced to live in limbo, unable to access the services they need because of the uncertainty surrounding their immigration status. The hon. Gentleman talks about the rights of the British people, but he ignores the rights of those who are most vulnerable. He talks about the need for control, but he ignores the need for compassion. We will not be swayed by the rhetoric of the EU; we will not be swayed by the hon. Gentleman's attempts to lecture us about the importance of diversity and inclusivity. We will make our own decisions about who we want to welcome into our country, and we will do it on the basis of merit, not on the basis of where someone was born. But we will do it with compassion, with empathy, and with a commitment to the values that have always defined our country. We will not abandon the most vulnerable people in our society, and we will not abandon the principles
Tim Farron: I must correct the hon. Lady. I did not say that we should abandon the most vulnerable people in our society. On the contrary, I said that we should be compassionate and provide support to those who are most vulnerable. The right hon. Lady's suggestion that I am stuck in the past is quite wrong. I am a strong advocate for the rights of EU nationals, and I will continue to fight for their rights. The right hon. Lady's comments about the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ruth Sargent) are quite irrelevant to this debate. We are not talking about the rights of EU nationals; we are talking about the rights of the most vulnerable people in our society. We are talking about the rights of unaccompanied minors, who are being torn from their families and left to fend for themselves in our country. We are talking about the rights of those who have been trafficked and exploited in our country, and who are now being forced to live in limbo, unable to access the services they need because of the uncertainty surrounding their immigration status.
