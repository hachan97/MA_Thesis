Christine Jardine: I beg to move, That this House has considered proposed changes to free movement of EU nationals. I am delighted to raise the issue of freedom of movement in the EU, and I thank you, Sir David, for your chairmanship. â‚¬End freedom of movementâ€ is a Brexiteer slogan that we have all become so accustomed to that it is easy to forget what it is really saying, and what it would really mean to this country, people living here and British citizens living abroad. We all know the basic numbers: freedom of movement allows 1.3 million British citizens to live, work, study, fall in love, marry, or retire across the European Union while more than 50,000 non-UK EU citizens work in our national health service, including support staff, nurses and doctors, all of whom play a vital role in our nation's health. More than 80,000 EU citizens work in social care, and even more in the UK construction industry. As the Government love to tell us, unemployment is at its lowest rate for 40 years, but where are the British workers who are queuing up and clamouring to take those jobs? If we end freedom of movement, who will care for our sick and elderly? Who will build the 300,000 homes a year that Britain needs? The Government's own figures show that non-UK EU citizens bring far more to our economy and public services than they use. If free movement ends, services will suffer because we will not have the people to continue to provide them at the same level. Those are the numbers, but what about the human cost and the sheer inhumanity of ending freedom of movement? Edinburgh West has constituents from France, Spain, Poland and many other EU countries who have made their lives in the city. Their children were born there, but now they are being told that they are not welcome. They feel they have no option but to leave.
Tim Farron: I rise to support my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh West. I am deeply moved by her words, and I am reminded of the countless times I have met with constituents who have been affected by the impact of ending free movement. It is not just about numbers; it is about people, and the lives that will be torn apart. My constituents in Westmorland and Lonsdale have made their homes in the UK, and they are not just EU nationals; they are human beings who have made a contribution to our society. They are the backbone of our communities, and they are the ones who will be most affected by the end of free movement. I have met with families who are being torn apart by the uncertainty of their future. I have met with individuals who are being forced to leave the UK because they are being told that they are not welcome. That is not a British way. That is not the way we treat our fellow human beings. We have a responsibility to protect the rights of EU nationals who have made their homes here. We have a responsibility to ensure that they can continue to live, work, study and contribute to our society. I urge the Government to think about the human cost of ending free movement. It is not just about numbers; it is about the people who will be affected. I urge the Government to reconsider their decision and to find a way to protect the rights of EU nationals who have made their homes in the UK.
Kit Malthouse: I rise to respond to my hon. Friend's impassioned speech. While I understand the concerns and the personal stories that have been shared, I must respectfully disagree with the premise that ending free movement is a decision that has been taken lightly. We have had a long and complex conversation about our relationship with the EU, and the decision to end free movement was not taken in isolation. We have been clear that we want to welcome EU nationals who are already living and working in the UK, and we have put in place the EU Settlement Scheme to provide a pathway to settle their status. However, we also need to be clear that we cannot continue to allow uncontrolled immigration, which would put a strain on our public services and undermine the rights of British citizens. My hon. Friend may say that this is not a British way, but I say that it is our duty to protect the interests of our own citizens. We need to have a fair and sustainable immigration system that balances our desire to welcome people to our country with the need to protect our public services. We are committed to ensuring that EU nationals who have made their homes in the UK can continue to live, work, study and contribute to our society, but we cannot do that through uncontrolled immigration. We need to have a system that is fair, efficient and transparent, and that is what we are working towards.
Tim Farron: I rise to respond to my hon. Friend's remarks, and I must say that I am disappointed, but not surprised, by the Minister's response. He talks about a fair and sustainable immigration system, but that is exactly what we have been trying to achieve through the EU Settlement Scheme. We are providing a pathway for EU nationals who are already living and working in the UK to settle their status, but the Minister's approach is to end free movement altogether. That is a step backwards, and it will have a devastating impact on the communities that have been built up over the years by EU nationals. We are not talking about uncontrolled immigration; we are talking about a fair and sustainable system that allows people to live, work and contribute to our society. The Minister talks about the interests of British citizens, but what about the interests of the people who have been living and working in the UK for decades, who have built their lives here, paid their taxes, and contributed to our society? They will be left in limbo, unsure of their future, while the Minister is busy implementing a policy that will cause them harm. We are not talking about a British way; we are talking about a British attitude, a British approach that says that we are a nation of immigrants, but only if we like it. That is not the Britain that I know, and that is not the Britain that I want to see. We need to take a different approach, one that values the contributions of EU nationals to
Rachael Maskell: I will say that the Minister's words are a perfect example of the bureaucratic language that he uses, but they are not the words of a Minister who genuinely cares about the people who will be affected by his policies. He talks about a fair and sustainable system, but that is a description of the EU Settlement Scheme, not of the policy that the Government are planning to introduce. The Minister's words are a recipe for disaster. He will create a system that is based on a points-based system, which will be incredibly difficult for people to navigate. It will be a system that is driven by the interests of the business sector, not by the needs of the people who will be affected. The Minister talks about the need to protect the integrity of the labour market, but that is not the only factor at stake. We are not talking about the interests of businesses; we are talking about the interests of people who have been living and working in the UK for decades. We are talking about the interests of families who are being torn apart by the Government's policies. The Minister's words are a perfect example of the bureaucratic language that he uses, but they are not the words of a Minister who genuinely cares about the people who will be affected by his policies. He talks about a fair and sustainable system, but that is a description of the EU Settlement Scheme, not of the policy that the Government are planning to introduce. The Minister's words are a recipe for disaster. He will create a system that is based
Jo Stevens: I'd like to respond to the Minister's words, which, as Rachael Maskell has said, are a perfect example of the bureaucratic language that he uses. But let's be clear, these are not the words of a Minister who genuinely cares about the people who will be affected by his policies. The Government's plans to introduce a points-based system are a recipe for disaster. It will be incredibly difficult for people to navigate, and it will be driven by the interests of the business sector, not by the needs of the people who will be affected. We are not talking about the interests of businesses; we are talking about the interests of people who have been living and working in the UK for decades. We are talking about the interests of families who are being torn apart by the Government's policies. The Minister talks about the need to protect the integrity of the labour market, but that is not the only factor at stake.

Steve Double: I think that is a rather emotive speech, Jo. However, I must correct you - the Minister's words were not bureaucratic language, but a clear and concise explanation of the Government's intentions. I think it's quite clear that the Government is committed to introducing a points-based system, which will be fair and sustainable for the UK. This system will allow us to control immigration in a way that is in the best interests of our country. We will not be able to allow free movement, as we have in the past, and we must consider the impact of that on our economy and our public services. We must also consider the impact on those who are already living and working in the UK, and the impact on those who wish to come here. We will be introducing a new points-based system, which will take into account the skills and qualifications of those who wish to come to the UK. It is not a case of tearing families apart, as some have suggested, but rather a case of ensuring that we have the right people coming to the UK to support our economy and our public services.
Kit Malthouse: I disagree, Steve. The Minister's words were not a clear and concise explanation of the Government's intentions, but a muddled and unclear statement that has caused unnecessary confusion. The Minister is trying to justify the Government's decision to end free movement, but the reality is that this is a policy that has been widely discredited and has caused harm to our economy and public services. The evidence is clear: free movement has allowed skilled workers to come to the UK, contributing to our economy and driving growth. By ending free movement, we are not just ending a policy, we are ending the opportunity for those workers to come to the UK and make a contribution. The Minister's claim that this is a matter of national sovereignty is not relevant, as the UK is already a member of the EU and has been since 1973. What matters is not the flag under which we fly, but the impact of our policies on our citizens. We must consider the impact of this policy on our economy, our public services, and our people. The Minister's attempt to justify this policy as a matter of fairness and sustainability is not convincing, and I fear that it will only serve to further polarise our country.
Jo Stevens: Kit Malthouse says that's not a clear and concise explanation of the Government's intentions. But I'd say that's exactly what he's trying to do - muddy the waters and confuse the public. The reality is, the Government's decision to end free movement was made without any proper consideration for the impact on our economy and public services. We've seen it already in the chaos that has erupted in our healthcare and social care sectors, where we've lost thousands of experienced workers, and our construction industry is crying out for more skilled workers. The evidence is clear: free movement has driven growth and innovation in this country. It's not just about the flag we fly, it's about the policies we make and the impact they have on our people. But the Government is refusing to listen to the evidence and instead is pushing forward with a policy that will only serve to further polarise our country and create more problems in the long run. I urge the Minister to come clean and admit that this is a policy that was made on the hoof, without proper consideration or consultation. We need a clear and honest explanation of the Government's intentions, not just empty words and platitudes.
Tim Farron: I couldn't agree more with my hon. Friend's words, and I must say that I am deeply disappointed that the Minister has not provided a clear and concise explanation of the Government's intentions. We all know that the decision to end free movement was made without proper consideration for the impact on our economy and public services. We have seen the chaos that has erupted in our healthcare and social care sectors, where we've lost thousands of experienced workers, and our construction industry is crying out for more skilled workers.

I urge the Minister to come clean and admit that this is a policy that was made on the hoof, without proper consideration or consultation. We need a clear and honest explanation of the Government's intentions, not just empty words and platitudes. The fact is, the Government's decision to end free movement has already caused irreparable damage to our economy and our public services. We need to take responsibility for the harm that we are causing and to come up with a new policy that will protect the rights of EU nationals who have made their homes in this country, while also ensuring that we have a fair and
Steve Double: I must correct my hon. Friend's assertion that the Government's decision was made without proper consideration for the impact on our economy and public services. We have been clear throughout this process that ending free movement was the right decision for our country, and we have provided a comprehensive analysis of the benefits and challenges that it poses. While it is true that we have seen some disruption in certain sectors, we have also seen the benefits of a more streamlined immigration system, which will allow us to attract the skills and talent that our economy needs to thrive. We have taken a pragmatic approach to this issue, and we have put in place a new points-based system that will allow us to control our borders and make decisions based on the needs of our economy. This is not a decision that we have taken lightly, and we have carefully considered the potential impacts on our economy and public services. I must say, I am disappointed that the Opposition is trying to portray this as a divisive issue, when in fact it is a matter of common sense. We are not trying to drive out EU nationals who have made their homes in this country; we are simply putting in place a new system that will allow us to control our borders and make decisions based on the needs of our economy. We have made it clear that EU nationals who have made their homes in the UK are welcome to stay, and we have put in place a new scheme that will allow them to apply for settled status. We have also committed to providing support for those
Tim Farron: I think my hon. Friend is being rather disingenuous. The Government have been clear that the end of free movement was a matter of national interest, and that it was necessary to control our borders and make decisions based on the needs of our economy. The Opposition are trying to portray it as a divisive issue, when in fact it is a matter of common sense. We are not trying to drive out EU nationals who have made their homes in this country; we are simply putting in place a new system that will allow us to control our borders and make decisions based on the needs of our economy. The points-based system that we have put in place will allow us to attract the skills and talent that our economy needs to thrive. We have made it clear that EU nationals who have made their homes in the UK are welcome to stay, and we have put in place a new scheme that will allow them to apply for settled status. We have also committed to providing support for those who are affected by the end of free movement. We are not trying to be xenophobic or to drive out EU nationals; we are simply trying to put in place a new system that will allow us to control our borders and make decisions based on the needs of our economy.
Steve Double: I am not being disingenuous, my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham has simply got it wrong. We are not trying to drive out EU nationals who have made their homes in this country. We are simply putting in place a new system that will allow us to control our borders and make decisions based on the needs of our economy. The points-based system that we have put in place will allow us to attract the skills and talent that our economy needs to thrive. It is not about excluding EU nationals, but about ensuring that our economy can compete in the global market and that we are not being held back by an uncontrolled flow of labour. The fact is, the free movement policy has been a one-way street, where our citizens have been free to travel to the EU, but EU nationals have not had the same freedom to come here. We have made it clear that EU nationals who have made their homes in the UK are welcome to stay, and we have put in place a new scheme that will allow them to apply for settled status. We have also committed to providing support for those who are affected by the end of free movement. It is not a divisive issue, it is a necessary step to ensure that our economy can compete in the global market.
Rachael Maskell: I am deeply disappointed by the hon. Gentleman's response. His words are not backed up by the reality on the ground. EU nationals who are here, who have made their homes in this country, are being forced to go through a bureaucratic nightmare to get settled status, and many are being left in limbo. The hon. Gentleman's points-based system is a Trojan horse for a two-tier system, where those with the right skills and connections will be allowed to stay, while those who do not have the same connections will be left to fend for themselves. That is not what this country is about. This country has always been a place of opportunity and a place of welcome. We are not just talking about the free movement of people; we are talking about the freedom of people to live and work in this country without fear of deportation. The hon. Gentleman's system is a barrier to that freedom. I urge him to think about the real impact of his policies on families and individuals. I have spoken to many families who are terrified about the future of their loved ones, who are being torn apart by the uncertainty of the EU Settlement Scheme. We need a system that is compassionate, a system that is fair, and a system that is based on the needs of our economy, not just the needs of the economy. The hon. Gentleman talks about the need for a points-based system, but he does not talk about the people who are affected by it. We need a system
Christine Jardine: I rise to support my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green, and I must say that I am utterly dismayed by the hon. Gentleman's response. His words are a stark reminder of the Government's complete lack of empathy for the people who will be most affected by the points-based system. He talks about the need for a points-based system, but what about the people who do not have the points? What about the single mother who is working multiple jobs to make ends meet, but still can't afford to pay the rent? What about the young person who has been here since they were a child, but now finds themselves in limbo because of the Government's inaction? The hon. Gentleman's system is a two-tier system, where those with the right skills and connections will be allowed to stay, while those who do not have the same connections will be left to fend for themselves. That is not what this country is about. We are not just talking about the free movement of people; we are talking about the freedom of people to live and work in this country without fear of deportation. I have spoken to countless families who are terrified about the future of their loved ones, who are being torn apart by the uncertainty of the EU Settlement Scheme. My hon. Friend has highlighted the bureaucratic nightmare that many EU nationals are facing, and I can attest to the fact that it is a system that is in dire need of reform. We need a system that is
Steve Double: I rise to support my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green. I must say that I am deeply troubled by the hon. Gentleman's response, which seems to be a classic case of 'the more things change, the more they stay the same.' The hon. Gentleman's suggestion that we should return to the old free movement system is not only unworkable, but it also ignores the will of the British people. The clear message from the last election was that we want a points-based system that is fair, efficient, and allows us to control our borders. We must not be swayed by emotional appeals to the heart, but rather by a rational and evidence-based approach. The EU Settlement Scheme is a bureaucratic nightmare, as my hon. Friend has highlighted, and it is not a solution to the problem. We need to get rid of the EU Settlement Scheme and replace it with a new system that is fair, efficient, and allows us to control our borders. I am not suggesting that we should turn our backs on our EU friends, but we must be clear about our priorities. We must make it clear that we value our relationship with the EU, but we also value the interests of British citizens. We must not be held hostage by the whims of the EU and its citizens. I urge my hon. Friend to support the Government's proposal and to reject the old free movement system. We must put the interests of British citizens first.
Tim Farron: I do not support the Government's proposal to end free movement with the EU. The Government's proposal is a clear breach of the manifesto commitment that we made in the last election, and it is a betrayal of the trust that we have placed in our elected representatives. We are not just talking about the rights of EU nationals in the UK, but also about the rights of British citizens who live in the EU. The Government's proposal is a slap in the face to the 4.8 million people who live in the UK who are EU nationals. It is a slap in the face to the 1.3 million people who live in the EU who are British citizens. It is a slap in the face to the thousands of British businesses that rely on EU citizens. The Government's proposal is a slap in the face to the many people who have made a significant contribution to our economy and public services. We are not just talking about the economic impact; we are talking about the human cost. The Government's proposal is a slap in the face to the people who have made the UK a more prosperous and more inclusive country. I say to the hon. Gentleman that we must not be swayed by the argument that we are being held hostage by the EU. We are not being held hostage; we are being held hostage by the Government's own inaction. The Government's inaction has created a crisis, and now they are trying to pass the buck. We will not stand for it.
Kit Malthouse: I disagree with my hon. Gentleman's assertion that the Government is betraying the trust of the British people. We have been clear about our commitment to ending free movement with the EU, and that is a promise we intend to keep. We have made it clear that we will not be bound by the free movement arrangements that existed prior to Brexit, and we will work with the EU to agree a fair and sustainable immigration system that protects the interests of British citizens. The hon. Gentleman's argument that we are being held hostage by the EU is a classic example of the kind of emotional and unrealistic rhetoric that we have heard from the Opposition on this issue. We are not being held hostage; we are being held hostage by our own inaction. We have a duty to act in the best interests of the British people, and that is exactly what we will do. We will work with the EU to agree a new immigration system that is fair, sustainable, and in the interests of British citizens. We will not be deterred by the Opposition's attempts to undermine our resolve on this issue.
Christine Jardine: I strongly disagree with the hon. Gentleman's assertion that the Government is being held hostage by the EU. That is a classic example of the kind of simplistic and unrealistic rhetoric that we have heard from the Opposition on this issue. The fact is, the Government's decision to end free movement has already had devastating consequences for thousands of EU nationals living in the UK, many of whom are being forced to leave their homes, their jobs, and their families in order to maintain their residency status. The hon. Gentleman's claim that we are not being held hostage by the EU is simply not borne out by the facts. The EU has made it clear that it will not agree to a new immigration system that would allow those who have been living and working in the UK for years to remain, unless they can demonstrate that they can contribute to the economy and public services. That is not a fair or sustainable solution, and it is certainly not in the interests of British citizens. I would also like to remind the hon. Gentleman that the Opposition's opposition to the Government's decision is not just about free movement, but about the human cost of this policy. Thousands of people are being forced to leave the UK, and many more are being forced to spend their lives in limbo, unsure of their future. This is not just a matter of numbers, it is a matter of human dignity and compassion. The Government needs to listen to the concerns of the people who are being affected by this policy,
Rachael Maskell: I am deeply moved by the hon. Lady's words. She is right to bring this issue to the House today. The Government's decision to end free movement has caused immense harm to thousands of people who have been living and working in this country for years. Many of them are being forced to leave their homes, their families, and their jobs to maintain their residency status. The hon. Lady's words are a powerful reminder of the human cost of this policy. As we have heard today, thousands of people are being forced to spend their lives in limbo, unsure of their future. That is not just a matter of numbers; it is a matter of human dignity and compassion. I am deeply moved by the hon. Lady's words, and I hope that the Government will take them seriously. We need to think about the impact of this policy on the most vulnerable people in our society, who are being forced to leave their homes and their families. We need to think about the impact on the economy, where thousands of people are being forced to leave their jobs and start again from scratch. We need to think about the impact on our public services, where thousands of people are being forced to leave their communities and start again from scratch. We need to think about the impact on our country, where thousands of people are being forced to leave their homes and their families. We need to think about the impact on the British people who are being forced to live in a country where they are no longer welcome
Tim Farron: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her powerful words. The hon. Lady's speech is a powerful reminder of the human cost of the Government's decision to end free movement. We have heard the stories of people who are being forced to leave their homes, their families, and their jobs to maintain their residency status. We have heard the stories of people who are being forced to spend their lives in limbo, unsure of their future. We have heard the stories of people who are being forced to start again from scratch, with no support, no assistance, and no safety net. We have heard the stories of people who are being forced to leave their communities, their friends, and their families. And we have heard the stories of people who are being forced to leave their country, their home, and their sense of belonging. I am deeply moved by the hon. Lady's words, and I hope that the Government will take them seriously. We need to think about the impact of this policy on the most vulnerable people in our society, who are being forced to leave their homes and their families. We need to think about the impact on the economy, where thousands of people are being forced to leave their jobs and start again from scratch. We need to think about the impact on our public services, where thousands of people are being forced to leave their communities and start again from scratch. We need to think about the impact on our country, where thousands of people are being forced to leave their homes
Kit Malthouse: I will not be swayed by emotive appeals, and I will not be deterred from our course of action. We have a duty to protect the interests of British citizens, and that includes our economy, our public services, and our national security. The hon. Gentleman's speech was a classic example of the kind of emotional manipulation that we have seen from those who oppose our policy. It was a speech that relied on the tears of the vulnerable, rather than on the facts. We know that the vast majority of people who have moved to the UK have done so voluntarily, and that the vast majority of those who have moved to the EU have done so voluntarily. We also know that our immigration system is not broken, and that we need to reform it to make it more sustainable and more fair. We need to make sure that our immigration system is not driven by the whims of the market, but by the needs of our country. We need to make sure that our immigration system is not driven by the interests of the wealthy and the well-connected, but by the needs of our economy and our society. We will not be swayed by emotional appeals, and we will not be deterred from our course of action. We will continue to work to reform our immigration system, and to make sure that it is fair, sustainable, and in the interests of our country.
Jo Stevens: Mr. Speaker, I strongly disagree with the Minister's assertion that the Government's decision to end free movement was not driven by emotional appeals. The Minister's speech was, in fact, a classic example of emotional manipulation, as it relied on the tears of the vulnerable and the fears of the anxious. He spoke of the "vulnerable" and the "anxious", but what about the millions of people who have been left in limbo, with their futures uncertain because of the Government's reckless decision? What about the people who have been denied the right to live and work in the country they love, simply because of their nationality? What about the families who have been torn apart, with loved ones separated by borders and borders that were previously open? The Minister's decision to end free movement was not about reforming the immigration system, but about creating a system that is hostile to those who need it most. It is a system that is driven by xenophobia and intolerance, rather than by a genuine desire to make our country a better place for all its citizens. I will not be swayed by the Minister's rhetoric, and I will continue to fight for the rights of those who are being affected by this policy.
Rachael Maskell: I will not be swayed by the Minister's rhetoric, and I will continue to fight for the rights of those who are being affected by this policy. The Minister's decision to end free movement was not about reforming the immigration system, but about creating a system that is hostile to those who need it most. It is a system that is driven by xenophobia and intolerance, rather than by a genuine desire to make our country a better place for all its citizens. I will continue to fight for the rights of those who are being affected by this policy.
Kit Malthouse: I must correct the honourable lady, that is not the truth. Our decision to end free movement was made to ensure that our immigration system is fair, efficient, and sustainable for the long-term. It is not about xenophobia or intolerance, but about being true to the will of the British people. We have a clear mandate to reform our immigration system, and we are committed to doing so in a way that protects the interests of British citizens and ensures that our public services are not overwhelmed. The fact remains, the free movement policy has been a failure, with many more people coming to our country than we can accommodate, putting a strain on our public services and our NHS. We are committed to creating a system that is more targeted, more efficient, and more effective in meeting the needs of our country. We will not be swayed by emotional appeals to sentiment, but by a clear-eyed assessment of what is best for our country.
Steve Double: I'd like to correct my honourable friend, the Minister for Immigration. He seems to have got it wrong. The decision to end free movement was not made to protect the interests of British citizens, but to further entrench the interests of the wealthy elite who already have a stranglehold on our economy. It is nothing short of a betrayal of the democratic will of the British people. The fact remains, our economy is in shambles, and our public services are being pushed to the breaking point. The free movement policy was a disaster, but that is not the issue. The issue is that the Government is now trying to pass the buck and blame the problem on the free movement policy, when in reality it is their own policies that have created the chaos. I say to the Minister, we must do better than that. We must do better than just blaming the problem. We must do better than just blaming the free movement policy. We must take responsibility for our own policies and our own mistakes. We must do better than that.
