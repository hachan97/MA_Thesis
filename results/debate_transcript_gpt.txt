Christine Jardine: I beg to move, That this House has considered proposed changes to free movement of EU nationals. I am delighted to raise the issue of freedom of movement in the EU, and I thank you, Sir David, for your chairmanship. €End freedom of movement” is a Brexiteer slogan that we have all become so accustomed to that it is easy to forget what it is really saying, and what it would really mean to this country, people living here and British citizens living abroad. We all know the basic numbers: freedom of movement allows 1.3 million British citizens to live, work, study, fall in love, marry, or retire across the European Union while more than 50,000 non-UK EU citizens work in our national health service, including support staff, nurses and doctors, all of whom play a vital role in our nation's health. More than 80,000 EU citizens work in social care, and even more in the UK construction industry. As the Government love to tell us, unemployment is at its lowest rate for 40 years, but where are the British workers who are queuing up and clamouring to take those jobs? If we end freedom of movement, who will care for our sick and elderly? Who will build the 300,000 homes a year that Britain needs? The Government's own figures show that non-UK EU citizens bring far more to our economy and public services than they use. If free movement ends, services will suffer because we will not have the people to continue to provide them at the same level. Those are the numbers, but what about the human cost and the sheer inhumanity of ending freedom of movement? Edinburgh West has constituents from France, Spain, Poland and many other EU countries who have made their lives in the city. Their children were born there, but now they are being told that they are not welcome. They feel they have no option but to leave.

Tim Farron: Thank you, Christine Jardine, for bringing this crucial issue to light. The impact of ending free movement on our society cannot be understated. As you eloquently pointed out, EU citizens play a vital role in our healthcare, social care, and construction industries, among others. The sheer inhumanity of telling these individuals, who have made their lives in the UK, that they are no longer welcome is deeply concerning.

It is not just about numbers or economic benefits; it is about the human cost of such a decision. Families are being torn apart, individuals are feeling unwelcome in the place they call home, and our services are at risk of suffering due to a lack of skilled workers. As a pro-European and advocate for individual rights, I stand firmly against the ending of free movement and will continue to fight for the protection of EU nationals' rights post-Brexit.

We cannot ignore the voices of those directly affected by these changes, and we must consider the real-life consequences of such a decision. I urge my colleagues to truly understand the impact of ending free movement and to consider the importance of upholding the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their nationality. Thank you.

Steve Double: Thank you for bringing up this important issue, Tim. It's clear that there are differing viewpoints on the topic of free movement post-Brexit, and it's crucial that we continue to have these discussions in a respectful manner.

While I understand your concerns about the impact of ending free movement on our society, I believe that the government's stance on controlling immigration is in the best interests of the country. We must prioritize national interests and ensure that our immigration policies are sustainable and effective.

I stand by the government's position on this matter and support the measures that have been put in place to address the needs of EU citizens currently residing in the UK. The EU Settlement Scheme has been successful in providing clarity and reassurance to those individuals, and we must continue to uphold their rights post-Brexit.

I appreciate your advocacy for individual rights, Tim, but we must also consider the broader implications of our immigration policies and the importance of safeguarding our national interests. Let's continue to have these discussions and work towards finding common ground on this complex issue.

Kit Malthouse: Thank you for bringing up this important issue, Steve. I appreciate your perspective on the complexities surrounding the topic of free movement post-Brexit.

I stand by the government's position and support the measures put in place to address the needs of EU citizens residing in the UK, such as the successful implementation of the EU Settlement Scheme. It is important that we uphold their rights post-Brexit while also considering the long-term implications of our immigration policies.
