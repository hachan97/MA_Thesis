We are finally starting to right that wrong by putting mental health on the same legal footing as physical health in the NHS, and next year we will introduce new access and waiting standards for mental health, as have existed for physical health for a long time. I hope that my hon. Friend knows that a few weeks ago I announced a complete overhaul of the way in which eating disorders-particularly those suffered by youngsters-are dealt with, so that that is done more properly than in the past.']),\n Message(role='user', content=['Given that the Deputy Prime Minister and his Lib Dem Ministers are rowing back from coalition policies at Olympic speeds, why are they still carrying red ministerial boxes and taking ministerial salaries in a Government whom they are so antagonistic towards?']),\n Message(role='assistant', content=[\"First, I congratulate the right hon. Lady on her honour-I am sure I do so on behalf of the whole House. I hope she will understand a rather simple distinction between our pride in the things that we have done in this coalition Government-taking people out of tax, expanding apprenticeships on a scale never done before, giving healthy meals at lunchtime to children, providing two, three and four-year-olds with more child care and pre-school support than ever before, and revolutionising our pension system so that the state pension is provided at a decent rate-and the disagreements about the future that of course political parties have, whether in coalition or not. I disagree with the Labour party's maÃ±ana, maÃ±ana approach to never really dealing with the deficit, and with the Conservative party's approach of carrying on with cuts even after the deficit has been dealt with. That is a perfectly reasonable disagreement about the future that we will all argue about over the next four or five months.\"])]"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":88},{"cell_type":"code","source":"messages = [Message.from_dict(msg) for msg in
