on the Brexit debate.\nI'm happy to engage in a respectful discussion on the topic, but I want to clarify that I'll be presenting a neutral perspective, and my goal is to facilitate a constructive conversation.\nThe UK's decision to leave the European Union (Brexit) was a contentious issue, and opinions on it vary widely. Here's a summary of the main arguments for and against the UK rejoining the EU:\n\n**Arguments For Rejoining the EU:**\n\n1. **Economic benefits**: Many argue that rejoining the EU would provide the UK with access to a large, integrated market, potentially boosting trade, investment, and economic growth.\n2. **Regulatory alignment**: EU membership would allow the UK to align its regulatory frameworks with those of the EU, reducing the complexity and costs associated with implementing and enforcing EU laws.\n3. **Cultural and social ties**: The UK's historical and cultural ties to the EU are strong, and rejoining would maintain these connections, potentially fostering greater cooperation and understanding between the UK and EU.\n4. **Security and defense**: EU membership would enable the UK to participate in EU defense and security initiatives, potentially enhancing its national security and defense capabilities.\n\n**Arguments Against Rejoining the EU:**\n\n1. **Sovereignty concerns**: Some argue that rejoining the EU would compromise the UK's sovereignty, as it would require the country to adopt and implement EU laws and regulations.\n2. **Bureaucratic complexity**: EU membership involves a complex system of laws, regulations, and institutions, which can be challenging for the UK to navigate and implement.\n3. **Financial costs**: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is estimated to be around £13 billion per year, which could be a significant financial burden for the country.\n4. **Uncertainty and risk**: Rejoining the EU would involve a significant amount of uncertainty and risk, particularly regarding the terms of the UK's re-entry into the EU and the potential impact on the UK's economy and politics.\n\n**Your thoughts?**\n\nPlease feel free to share your opinions on the UK rejoining the EU. What are your concerns, and what do you think are the most significant advantages and disadvantages of rejoining the EU?\n\nI'll do my best to respond thoughtfully and respectfully, and we can continue the conversation from there!\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":16},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Load Model: Tuned Boris","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# base_model_name = \"meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B\"\nPEFT_MODEL = \"/kaggle/input/llama_boris/pytorch/default/1\"\nbnb_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(\n    load_in_4bit=True,                      #
