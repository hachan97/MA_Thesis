Mr. Pleuger (Germany): We thank the Chairman
of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC),
Ambassador Konuzin, for his detailed and substantial
report. My delegation would like to join others in
congratulating him - as well as his team - on having
taken up his important office.

We also welcome the presence of the new
Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism
Committee Executive Directorate, Ambassador Javier
Ruperez. He will, in our view, play a crucial role in
setting up the CTC's new support structure in the
months to come. We would like to assure him of our
full support in that important and difficult task. We are
confident that he will always be guided by the CTC's
key objective, that is, to enhance the ongoing dialogue
with all United Nations Member States in the spirit of
cooperation, transparency and even-handedness.

In addition to improving the CTC's operative
structures, the ongoing revitalization must preserve and
further strengthen the CTC's legitimacy in the
perception of all United Nations Member States. We
are therefore looking forward to seeing an expert on
human rights and the rule of law included in the senior
staff of the Executive Directorate. In this respect we
fully share the views just expressed by Ambassador
Baja.

The Executive Directorate will also offer
increased possibilities for further intensifying the
CT C's cooperation and coordination with other United
Nations bodies, in particular with the Al Qaeda and
Taliban sanctions Committee.

Important steps have already been taken in that
respect by the two Committees: by the two Chairmen
and by the current expert teams. We feel that they all
deserve our full recognition, and we will continue to
support the improvement of their important work.

Let me conclude by affirming that Germany fully
subscribes to the statement to be made later by
Ambassador van den Berg on behalf of the Dutch
presidency of the European Union.
