The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/201l/47l, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/20ll/422, which contains the report of
the Secretary-General on the African Union-United
Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (S/2011/422).

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by Show of hands.

In favour:
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
Colombia, France, Gabon, Germany, India,
Lebanon, Nigeria, Portugal, Russian Federation,
South Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland and United States of
America.

The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 2003 (2011).

I now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
adoption of the resolution.
