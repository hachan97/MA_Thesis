Mr. Pereyra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): Peru
abstained in the voting because it believes that the draft
resolution does not adequately reflect what is
happening in the Middle East.

First, the draft resolution does not take account of
the fact that elements of Hizbollah, considered a
terrorist organization, have kidnapped two Israeli
soldiers and have launched rockets, causing civilian
casualties and provoking a response by the Israeli
Defence Forces.

Secondly, the draft resolution does not take
account of the Quartet's requirements that the
Palestinian Authority Hamas-led Government
recognize Israel, renounce violence and respect the
agreements previously entered into by the Palestinian
Authority. Non-compliance with those requirements is
at the root of the crisis and is preventing the parties
from resuming diplomatic negotiations leading to the
peaceful coexistence of two States, Israel and
Palestine, in accordance with the provisions of the road
map.

Peru deplores the escalation of violence and the
loss of innocent human lives. It calls for the release of
the kidnapped soldiers, including the two soldiers
3
taken hostage in Lebanon, as well as of the elected
Palestinian officials who were recently illegally
detained.

Peru recognizes Israel's right to defend itself.
However, Israel must do so in accordance with
international humanitarian law, avoiding causing harm
to civilians and damage to the infrastructure of
Lebanon and Gaza. We urge Israel to avoid the
excessive use of force and deplore the harm caused to
Palestinian and Lebanese civil society.
