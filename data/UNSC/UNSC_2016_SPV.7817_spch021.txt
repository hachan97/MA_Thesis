Mr. Safronkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I simply want to state for the record that
we are witnessing, within the Security Council, the
normalization of a culture of unacceptable behaviour.
When the Permanent Representative of the Syrian
Arab Republic took the floor, other Permanent
Representatives purposefully stood up and left the
Chamber. We believe that such conduct points to their
lack of courage to listen to a statement made by a
professional colleague. That is unacceptable.
