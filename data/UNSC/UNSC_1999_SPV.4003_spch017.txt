Mr. van Walsum (Netherlands): I would like to
comment briefly on the statement of the speaker before
me.

The present conflict will one day come to an end,
but if Serbia wants to be part of Europe it will at last
have to start realizing why it has been subjected to NATO
air strikes. One day the Serbian people will have to
understand that our intervention on account of the
atrocities committed by the Serbian security forces and
the Yugoslav army in Kosovo would probably not have
been possible if it had not been preceded by almost eight
years of ethnic cleansing, carried out in the name of the

 

Serbian nation, first in the Krajina in East Slavonia, then in
Bosnia and finally in its ultimate form in Kosovo.

Were it not for our accumulated disgust at this
practice, we might not have had the courage to act.
