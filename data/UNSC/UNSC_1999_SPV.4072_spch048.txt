The President: I thank the representative of Japan
for his kind words addressed to me.

There are a number of speakers remaining on my
list. In view of the lateness of the hour, I intend, with the
concurrence of the members of the Council, to suspend
the meeting now. The Security Council will resume this
meeting after the short informal consultations of the
Council that will be held tomorrow, Tuesday, 30
November 1999, at 10 am.

The meeting was suspended at 8.20 pm.
