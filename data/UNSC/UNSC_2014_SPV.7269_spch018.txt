Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): I would
like to thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his
briefing.

The downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 in
eastern Ukraine on 17 July is a tragedy that caused
298 deaths. China has taken note of the preliminary
report of the investigation issued by the Dutch Safety
Board on 9 September. China hopes that, through
an independent, just, objective and transparent
international investigation, the truth can be established
and justice served for victims and their loved ones at
an early date. China calls upon the parties concerned
to offer cooperation and coordination with the
investigation in accordance with the relevant Council
resolution and provide objective, authentic and
verifiable evidence in order to ensure that the result
of the investigation is credible and able to withstand
any scrutiny. International specialized agencies, such
as International Civil Aviation Organization, should
continue their pivotal role in the investigation.

Objectively speaking, the continuous improvement
in the situation in Ukraine is conducive to the smooth
conduct of the international investigation of the
incident. China welcomes the recent signing between
the Government of Ukraine and the militias in the
east of the Minsk ceasefire agreement, which is in
conformity with the fundamental, long-term interests
of the Ukrainian people.
China has also taken note of the bill recently
adopted by the Ukrainian Parliament that grants special
status to the eastern part of Ukraine. China hopes that
in the next phase the parties concerned will continue
their constructive efforts to ensure the effective
implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreement. In
the meantime, inclusive dialogue should be initiated
as soon as possible in order to find a balanced, lasting
and comprehensive political settlement that takes into
consideration the common interests of various ethnic
groups and regions in Ukraine.
