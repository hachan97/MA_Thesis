The President: There are no further speakers on
my list. Before adjourning the meeting I remind
Council members of the private meeting that will
follow shortly after this meeting. As agreed earlier, the
private meeting will accord an opportunity to Council
members to further exchange their views on the issue
before the Council. I therefore invite all non-Council
members, observers and media personnel to leave the
Chamber. We will recess for 15 minutes before our
private meeting.

The meeting rose at 1.50 p.m.
