The President: I thank Mr. Gambari for his
briefing.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers
to limit their statements to no more than five minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
strongly urged to circulate the text in writing and to
deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.
