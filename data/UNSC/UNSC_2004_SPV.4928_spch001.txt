The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Albania, Ireland, Japan, Jordan,
Serbia and Montenegro and The former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, in which they request to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

On behalf of the Security Council, I welcome His
Excellency Mr. Goran Svilanovic, Minister for Foreign
Affairs of Serbia and Montenegro, and invite him to
take a seat at the Council table.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Svilanovic

Council table; the representatives of the other
aforementioned countries took the seats reserved
for them at the side of the Council Chamber.

The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in response to the
request contained in a letter dated 17 March 2004 from
the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of
