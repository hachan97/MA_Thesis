Mr. Raytchev (Bulgaria): The Republic of
Bulgaria regrets that it was not possible to achieve
unanimity among the 15 member States of the Security
Council on the draft resolution just voted. We strongly
believe that the division of the Council does not help in
any way to find just solutions in favour of peace and
security.

By abstaining, the Republic of Bulgaria does not
oppose the text of the draft resolution in principal. We
categorically deplore all acts of violence causing a loss
of human life and destruction.
