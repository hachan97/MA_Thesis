Mr. Granovsky (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian delegation is satisfied with the
way in which the Government of the Republic of the
Sudan has met the demands of Security Council
resolutions 1054 (1996) and 1070 (1996). We also note
the official statements in support of the lifting of the
anti-Sudan sanctions on the part of the Organization of
African Unity, the Coordinating Bureau of the Non-
Aligned Movement and the Group of Arab States,
which all indicate that Sudan has fully met all of the
demands that were made on it.

It is important that the Council objectively assess
the specific steps taken by the Government of Sudan to
remove the grounds that had led to the introduction of
sanctions. The Russian Federation views positively the
fact that Egypt and Ethiopia, which had once insisted
on imposing sanctions against Sudan, have now
officially withdrawn their claims against it and, in
principle, support the request of its Government for
lifting the sanctions regime.

Pursuant to the demands of the Security Council,
Sudan has now completed its accession to all
international anti-terrorist conventions, including
relevant inter-Arab and inter-African agreements.
Sudan's conduct in good faith on this matter has
created conditions for the gradual normalization of its
relations with neighbouring States and in the region as
a whole.

We believe that the specific steps taken by the
Government of the Republic of the Sudan to meet the
demands in resolutions 1054 (1996) and 1070 (1996),
and also the positive reaction to this by the
international community, are sufficient grounds for the
Council's now taking a decision to lift sanctions
against the Republic of the Sudan.
