Mr. Sergeyev (Ukraine) (spoke in Russian): I have
come to realize that it is sometimes useless to comment
on certain things, since our Russian colleagues will
stand by their opinion and represent the situation the
way they want, regardless.

That is the reason for the virtual reality that our
Russian colleagues have constructed, where they live
in their own world while everyone else says the same
thing. Whether Mr. Churkin wants to or not, he will
have to take part in a discussion of the issue of Crimea
because it is Ukrainian territory. It may be temporarily
occupied, but until it is returned we will discuss it. We
have seen the entire world lend its support for Ukraine
on this subject.

It is a shame that the Russian Ambassador should use
such language as "lies" and so forth when commenting
on his colleagues' words. It is a shame that neither he
nor his deputies attended the Security Council's meeting
with the delegation from the Crimea, led by the well-
known human rights champion Mustafa Dzhemilev,
who spent 15 years in Soviet prisons for defending the
rights of his people. He said what I said when I repeated
his words, which the Russian Ambassador called lies
and provocations. So the Crimean Tartars will now hear
that the Russians consider their position to be mere lies
and provocations.

I have no further comment, because everything
said to date consists yet again of manipulation and
distortion in a style we are all familiar with. I think
Council members for their attention, their support and
their patience.
