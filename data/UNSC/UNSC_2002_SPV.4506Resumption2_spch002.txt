Mr. Wehbe (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): Allow me, Mr. President, to express our great
appreciation for all the efforts that you and the other
members of the Council have made to unify the voice
of the Council before the challenges faced by our
region. The Council has acted, in View of the escalation
of the Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people
and Israel's occupation of the cities of Ramallah,
Tulkarm, Qalqilyah, Bethlehem, Nablus and Jenin. In
view of Israel's violation of humanitarian law and the
Fourth Geneva Convention, the position we shall be
adopting by supporting the draft resolution before us is
an expression of our firm support and our constant call
for the establishment of an independent Palestinian
State with East Jerusalem as its capital.

When the Arab Group submitted the draft
resolution, its objective was to call upon the
international community to understand the trials and
sufferings of the Palestinian people, the oppression
they are suffering at the hands of the Israeli occupation
forces. Syria's position in supporting the draft
resolution reflects our genuine desire to see the
Security Council assume its role effectively, and once
again affirms the importance of unity in the work of the
Council and of unanimous action to address anything
that would endanger international peace and security.
