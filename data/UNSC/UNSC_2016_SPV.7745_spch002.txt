Mr. Moustafa (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Egypt
welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution
2299 (2016) on the extension of the mandate of the
United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq, given the
pivotal role played by the Mission in supporting the
stabilization of Iraq and helping the Government to
create a better future for the Iraqi people. Egypt affirms
the importance of building a more active dynamic in
connection with future national reconciliation and
welcomes the resolution's call for all political parties to
redouble their efforts to overcome their differences and
work within a comprehensive political process aimed at
developing a unified national vision of reconciliation
and strengthening the national unity and territorial
sovereignty of Iraq by setting aside their factional and
sectarian differences.

Egypt also takes this opportunity to welcome the
military, financial and logistical support provided by
the international community to the Government of
Iraq, in particular by the brother State of Kuwait, which
granted Iraq's request that it defer repayment of its debts
to that country until 1 July 2018, taking into account
the Government of Iraq's numerous obligations under
paragraph 21 of resolution 1483 (2003), which calls on
Iraq to deposit 5 per cent of its petroleum proceeds into
the Compensation Fund established in accordance with
resolution 687 (1991).

The meeting rose at 3.10pm.
