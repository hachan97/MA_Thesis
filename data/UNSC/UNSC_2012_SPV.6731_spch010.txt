Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): On
behalf of the Chinese delegation, I should like to
welcome the Prime Minister of Libya to today's
meeting and to thank him for his statement.

I wish to make two points. First, the Libyan
conflict led to the massive return of people to their
homelands and to the proliferation of weapons,
impacting the socio-economic development of Libya's
neighbours. That impact may continue for some time.
We therefore believe that the Security Council should
draw lessons from the way the Libyan issue was
addressed. The Prime Minister of Libya said earlier
that his country intends to convene a regional
conference on the proliferation of weapons. We
appreciate and welcome that effort.

Secondly, the Human Rights Council recently
established the International Commission of Inquiry.
The Commission's report (A/HRC/19/68) explicitly
states that NATO's airstrikes in Libya caused civilian
casualties and that certain targets were not military
facilities. The Commission also suggests that further
investigations should be conducted. This finding is also
in line with a number of media reports.

China expresses its deep concern in that regard.
These events bear on the correct implementation of
NATO's mandate under the Security Council's
resolutions and on the authority and gravity of those
resolutions. The Council must therefore understand the
situation as a whole. China supports the efforts of the
Security Council to remain seized of the situation and
to undertake further investigations of this case.
