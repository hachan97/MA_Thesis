Mr. Dejammet (France) (interpretation from French):
I also welcome the presence in our midst of General
Carneiro.

France is deeply concerned at the deterioration of the
situation in Angola in recent weeks. This situation has been
marked by an absence of progress in the peace process and
by an increased number of armed incidents, including
against the United Nations Mission, incidents which the
Council has recently condemned.

The Special Representative of the Secretary-General,
Maitre Blondin Beye, whose efforts are fully backed by
France, has proposed a plan to restore confidence and
resolve this crisis. We welcome the efforts made by the
Angolan Government to implement the plan, and we also
express our satisfaction at the commitment shown by the
Angolan Government to pursue the path of political
dialogue.

We deplore, by contrast, that the UNITA leadership
has not lived up to its obligations. This attitude seriously
jeopardizes stability in Angola.

The draft resolution before the Council is designed to
preserve the peace process and to make possible the
attainment of its objectives. It calls upon UNITA to
cooperate immediately with the extension of State
administration. If the UNITA leadership refuses to
cooperate, additional sanctions envisaged under this draft
resolution will enter into force.

These additional sanctions, notably in the economic
and financial areas, were implicitly envisaged by resolution
1127 (1997), adopted by the Council in August 1997. At
that time, we thought it would not be necessary to have
recourse to these sanctions.

Unfortunately, UNITA did not understand the resolve
expressed at that time by our Council. We hope that this
time UNITA will understand the signal being sent and will
act accordingly.

This is why France is will vote in favour of the draft
resolution.
