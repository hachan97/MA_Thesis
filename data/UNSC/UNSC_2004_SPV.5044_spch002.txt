Mr. Kalomoh (Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs): It gives me great pleasure to present
to the Council the draft annual report of the Security
Council for the period 1 August 2003 to 31 July 2004,
to be submitted to the General Assembly pursuant to
Article 24, paragraph 3, of the United Nations Charter,
which has been prepared by the Secretariat in line with
the revised format agreed upon by the Security Council
in 2002.

The format of the draft report before the Council
provides a guide to the activities of the Council in a
concise manner. In this connection, I should like to
note that this is the third report prepared in accordance
with the provisions of the note by the President of the
Security Council of 22 May 2002 (S/2002/l99), which
were aimed at enhancing the quality of the report and
accommodating the views expressed in the previous
format.

Of particular interest is the introduction to the
report, which contains an analytical summary of the
work of the Council for the period covered by the
report.

A corrigendum containing changes made by some
Council members is also before the Council.
I believe and hope that Council members will
find the report helpful.
