Mr. Al-Mouallimi (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): I will be brief. It is unfortunate when I hear
our colleague, the representative of Iran, trying to
prolong this discussion. He is openly repeating his lies.
He says that we tell him "It is none of your business".
That is true; it is none of his business. It is none of
Iran's business to interfere in the Arab world. Iran
always boasts that it is occupying Arab capitals. It is
none of its business to interfere in Iraq, Syria, Bahrain
or anywhere else.

He says that every week his country is detaining
terrorists. Yes, every week it detains its own citizens. It is
torturing and prisoning them. That is well known about
Iran. It has spread sectarianism. Our relationship with
Iran has been historically positive. However, it soured
after the Iranian revolution, which called for exporting
sectarianism across the Arab and Islamic world.
