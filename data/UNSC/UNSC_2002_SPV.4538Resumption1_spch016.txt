The President: Before giving the floor to the
next speaker, I would like to note that we have 19
remaining non-members inscribed to speak. In
addition, several Council members have indicated their
desire to respond. This is an important topic that we are
debating, and it is my intention to give every speaker
the opportunity to put across his or her views. But,
given the long list of speakers, I am sure that everyone
will agree with me that we have a common interest in
not finishing our discussion too late. If possible, I hope
that speakers will attempt to be as brief and focused as
possible, without, of course, leaving out any important
points that they may wish to put across.

The next speaker is the representative of Senegal,
whom I invite to take a seat at the Council table and to
make his statement.
