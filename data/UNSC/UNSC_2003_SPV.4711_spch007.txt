The President: I thank Mr. Braun for his
briefing.
I shall now open the floor to Council members
who wish to address questions to Mr. Nishimura and to
the other briefers. I would suggest that we hear all the
questions first; then I shall give the floor back to the
three briefers to answer the questions raised and to
provide further clarifications.
