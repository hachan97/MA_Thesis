Ms. Power (United States of America): I will be
brief, but in response to my colleague from the Russian
Federation, I would like to say just a few things.

First, the United States has constantly called for
de-escalation and urged restraint. That has been our
consistent policy. Our consistent statements have made
clear that military force is not the answer, and we have
commended the Ukrainians, frankly, for enduring more
than probably any country in the United Nations could
or would endure without using force. Therefore, there
have been no shortage of efforts at diplomacy.

Secondly, it is not the United States that has
escalated the situation, it is the Russian Federation.

Thirdly, while we would like to place our faith in
talks with the Russian Federation, the European Union
and Ukraine, it is hard to reconcile the behaviour of
the Russian Federation, the propaganda of the Russian
Federation and the military actions of the Russian
Federation - which range from the massing of 40,000
troops on the border to the subversive activities inside
Ukraine - with their appeal for diplomacy and
de-escalation. It is an appeal that we wish were in fact
sincere.

Fourthly, a few times, the representative of the
Russian Federation has described what is happening in
the eastern cities as protests and demonstrations. I would
refer back to my French colleague's comment that those
claims are rooted in some idea that the Internet does not

exist and that people cannot see for themselves that they
are not protests and they are not demonstrations. They
are professional forces carrying weapons - Russian-
made weapons, as it happens - and carrying out
sophisticated, coordinated military operations across
a substantial number of eastern Ukrainian cities. They
are not demonstrations. They are not protests. They are
military operations.

Finally, the credibility of the Russian Federation
has been gravely undermined. That said, we remain
eager and willing to talk about how to de-escalate the
situation. That will require that the Russian Federation
pull back its forces, which are ominously stationed
and massed at the eastern Ukrainian border. It will
require that the Russian Federation work to de-escalate
the situation in the light of the armed takeover of
those buildings. If, in fact, the Russian Federation
is interested in peace and in upholding its role as an
enforcer of international peace and security, then it will
engage quickly and with a wholly different degree of
conviction, urgency and truthfulness than it has up to
this point.
