The President (Spoke in French): As this is the first
meeting of the Security Council for the month of May, I
should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute, on behalf
of the Council, to His Excellency Mr. Alain Dejammet,
Permanent Representative of France to the United Nations,
for his service as President of the Security Council for the
month of April 1999. I am sure I speak for all members of
the Security Council in expressing deep appreciation to
Ambassador Dejammet for the great diplomatic skill with
which he conducted the Council's business last month.

Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.
Admission of new Members

Letter dated 14 April 1999 from the President of
the Republic of Kiribati addressed to the
Secretary-General (S/1999/477)

The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

In a letter dated 14 April 1999 addressed to the
Secretary-General, the President of the Republic of
Kiribati submitted the application of his country for
membership in the United Nations. That letter has been
circulated in document S/1999/477.

Under the provisions of rule 59 of the provisional
rules of procedure of the Security Council, unless the
Council decides otherwise, an application for membership
shall be referred by the President of the Council to the
Committee on the Admission of New Members.
Accordingly, unless I hear a proposal to the contrary, I
shall refer the application of the Republic of Kiribati to
the Committee on the Admission of New Members for
examination and report.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The date for the meeting of the Committee on the
Admission of New Members will be fixed by the
President in consultations with the members of the

Council.

The meeting rose at 12.15 pm.
