Mr. Terzi di Sant'Agata (Italy): Allow me,
Mr. President, to thank you for your kind words of
welcome and to express my warm greetings to the
other members of the Security Council. It is a great
honour for me to commence my duties as the
Permanent Representative of Italy to the United
Nations here in the Security Council. I hardly need to
emphasize the importance that the Italian Government
attaches to the decisive action that the Council can and
must carry out in the framework of the maintenance of
international peace and security.

I say these words at a time at which it is crucial
that the Council be unified if it is to fulfil its role in
promoting solutions to international crises in various
parts of the world in a manner that is true to the
principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and
consistent with international law.

The world looks to the Security Council with
high expectations, and I believe that all of us can rise
to those expectations by promoting effective solutions,
built on consensus. It is therefore in that spirit of
continuity that I shall represent my country as a
Council member elected by the General Assembly in
these concluding months of the biennium of our
membership.
