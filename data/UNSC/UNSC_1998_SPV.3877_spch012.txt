Mr. Dangue Rewaka (Gabon) (interpretation from French): The horror of the massacres perpetrated in 1994
in Rwanda by extremist groups aroused the consternation
and the indignation of the international community.

Therefore, concerned to put an end to these
extremely violent acts and to punish the perpetrators
severely, the Security Council, by resolution 955 (1994),
established the International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda to prosecute those presumed responsible for acts
of genocide or other grave violations of international
humanitarian law committed on the territory of Rwanda,
as well as those Rwandan citizens accused of such acts or
violations committed on the territory of neighbouring
States between 1 January and 31 December 1994.

In our opinion, the establishment of this institution
should - by the exemplary nature of its judgements -
not only alleviate the great sorrow of the families of the
victims, but also contribute to mitigating the social
tensions and serve as a deterrent to all those who might
be tempted to commit such acts.

Given the limited capacities of the operating
structures and the number of people who have been
accused, the President of the Tribunal proposed, as was
foreseen in the provisions of resolution 955 (1994), that
a third Trial Chamber of the International Tribunal for
Rwanda be established.

 

This Third Chamber will make it possible for the
accused to be prosecuted without delay, thereby meeting the
legitimate expectations of the Rwandan population and of
the international community. This draft resolution
accomplishes this, and my delegation firmly supports it.
