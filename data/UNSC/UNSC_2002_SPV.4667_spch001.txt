The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations. Members of the Council have before
them document S/2002/1351, which contains the text
of a draft resolution submitted by the United States of
America.

Council who wish to make statements before the
voting.
