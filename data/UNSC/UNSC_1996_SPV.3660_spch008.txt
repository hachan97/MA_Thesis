Mr. Ferrarin (Italy): I wish to thank the non-
aligned members of the Council for having prepared and
introduced the draft resolution. The Italian delegation has
great respect for the positions of the Non-Aligned Caucus,
particularly its African members, since they are the ones
that have worked on this very same case in the
framework of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).

The draft resolution before us meets the Security
Council's purpose - that is, to send a clear signal in the
hope that the Sudan will comply with resolution S/1044
(1996), thereby avoiding the dangerous isolation of that
country from the international community.

The time has come for Khartoum to heed its
responsibilities to the international community and to
show its political will to fully comply with Security
Council resolutions.

My country's relations with this region of Africa are
ancient and traditionally intense. Italy wants peace to
return to the region and also strongly believes in the need
to fight terrorism, wherever it may be, in the interests of
international peace and security.

For these reasons, Italy will vote in favour of the
draft resolution. We hope that the Sudan will be
responsive to this clear signal from the international
community and make every effort to fulfil its obligations

 

and thereby return to normal relations with other countries
in the interests of the Government and people of the Sudan,
of the States in the region and of international peace and
security.
