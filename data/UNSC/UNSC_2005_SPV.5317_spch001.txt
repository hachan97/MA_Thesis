The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

After consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council condemns the
decision of the Government of Eritrea to request
some members of the United Nations Mission in
Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) to leave the
country within 10 days, effective as of
6 December 2005, which is inconsistent with the
obligations of the Government of Eritrea to
respect the exclusively international nature of the
peacekeeping operation. In this regard, the
Security Council unequivocally demands that
Eritrea immediately reverse its decision without
preconditions.

"The Security Council recalls that by
resolution 1640 (2005), it demanded that the
Government of Eritrea reverse all restrictions
imposed on the operations of UNMEE.

"The Security Council will be consulting on
how to respond to this completely unacceptable
action by Eritrea."

This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol
S/PRST/2005/59.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 1.35 17.171.
