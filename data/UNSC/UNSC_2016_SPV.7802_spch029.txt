Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): With regard to today's topic, I would like
to draw attention to the fact that many delegations
have referred today to the need for a political track
in settling conflicts to prevent asymmetrical threats.
In that regard, I would like to refer to the Minsk
agreements, which, for almost two years now, have
remained unfulfilled despite the promises of President
Poroshenko of Ukraine. Shelling continues on an almost
daily and various artillery systems firing on populated
areas. Houses and buildings are being destroyed.
People are dying. The truth is reflected in the reports
of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Human Rights. Those reports reveal the arbitrary
detentions, kidnappings, torture, sexual violence and
other brazen human rights violations carried out by
Ukraine, both by its security services and by other law
enforcement agencies.

Changing the situation in Donbas is within the
realm of the possible, and achieving solid, sound
peace is a goal for which we should strive, and it is
possible. However, all of that will happen only through
scrupulous compliance with the Minsk agreements. It is
for that reason that we call upon Kyiv to accelerate the
fulfilment of those agreements.
