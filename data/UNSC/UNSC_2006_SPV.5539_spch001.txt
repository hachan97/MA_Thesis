The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Lebanon and the Syrian Arab
Republic, in which they request to be invited to
participate in the consideration of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Ms. Ziade
(Lebanon) and Mr. Ja'afari (Syrian Arab Republic)
took seats at the Council table.

The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Serge Brammertz,
Commissioner of the International Independent
Investigation Commission.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Brammertz to take a seat at the
Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2006/760, which contains a letter dated 25
September 2006 from the Secretary-General addressed
to the President of the Security Council, transmitting
the report of the International Independent
Investigation Commission.
I now give the floor to Mr. Serge Brammertz,
Commissioner of the International Independent
Investigation Commission.
