The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Somalia, in which he requests that the
Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Transitional Federal
Government of Somalia be invited to participate in the
consideration of the item on the Council's agenda. In
accordance with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite the Minister for
Foreign Affairs of the Transitional Federal Government
of Somalia to participate in the consideration of the
item, without the right to vote, in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Ibrahim
(Somalia) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: On behalf of the Council, I wish
to extend a warm welcome to His Excellency
Mr. Yusuf Hasan Ibrahim, Minister for Foreign Affairs
of the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia.

In accordance with the understanding reached in
the Council's prior consultations, I shall take it that the
Security Council agrees to extend an invitation under
rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure to His
Excellency Mr. Ramtane Lamamra, Commissioner for
Peace and Security of the African Union Commission.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Lamamra to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

I welcome the presence of the Secretary-General,
His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, and I invite him to
take the floor.
