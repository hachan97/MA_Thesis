Mr. Andjaba (Namibia): The current crisis in the
Serbian province of Kosovo in particular and in the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia in general is a source of great
concern to us. The degree of brutality perpetrated on the
civilian population, the massacre of women, children and
the elderly, the displacement of people from their homes,
kidnappings and the wanton destruction of property
continue to take place in Kosovo.

What we have been yearning for in the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, as in any crisis situation, is peace.
More violence and destruction cannot salvage peace.

In numerous cases of conflict situations it has been
the view of the Security Council - and rightly so - that
military action is not the solution, but rather that peaceful
means should be resorted to. This principle has been
reaffirmed time and time again - and even recently,
during the open meeting that the Council convened on
Friday, 19 March 1999. It is a principle that we believe
should not be used selectively.

My delegation wishes to underscore that military
action against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia may
not be the solution. Furthermore, the implications of this
action may go beyond the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, thereby posing a serious threat to peace and
security in the region.

Therefore, my delegation appeals for the immediate
cessation of the ongoing military action and for the
exhausting of all possible avenues for a peaceful
resolution of the conflict.
