The President: The Council has now concluded
the present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. Before adjourning the meeting, however, as
this is the last scheduled meeting of the Council for
the month of November, I would like to say how much
the entire Australian team and I have appreciated the
cooperation, the collegiality and even the empathy we
have received from all of our colleagues in Council.

We express our thanks and gratitude for all the
assistance and support we have received from the
Security Council Affairs Division, on which we have
relied for its professionalism, hard work and diligence,
and to all the other personnel in Conference Services
and other parts of the Secretariat, including our
security personnel. They have all been a very efficient
and a friendly part of our Council team. I thank the
interpreters, who have often had to give us just that
additional bit of time in longer meetings.

As our presidency will end in the next few days, I
know I speak on behalf of all the Council members in
wishing the delegation of Chad a very good presidency
in the month of December. I will not say just, "Good
luck", because although we wish that, of course, I think
it is very obvious to all of us that, in its preparations
for the month of December, the Chadian delegation has
shown that it is not relying on good luck alone. So we
look forward to a very constructive and very productive
month. I know that the delegation of Chad can expect
the completely uninhibited support of all Council
members.

The meeting rose at11.50 am.
