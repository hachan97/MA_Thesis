Mr. Traore (Guinea) (spoke in French): First of
all, I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for
organizing this public meeting on the United Nations
Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH). I
would also like to welcome the presence among us of
High Representative Lord Ashdown and Special
Representative of the Secretary-General Jacques Paul
Klein. I also wish to thank them for their very useful
statements.

My delegation commends the High
Representative for the tremendous effort he is making
on the ground. We share the concerns he expressed in
his statement, and we pledge our support to him with
regard to the priorities he has identified. We appeal to
the international community to continue to support him
in the reform he has initiated in Bosnia.

As UNMIBH draws to a close, my delegation
would like to commend Mr. Klein for the
professionalism and competence with which he has led
the Mission.

Despite the low voter turnout, my delegation is
pleased with the way elections were conducted in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. This is an achievement that
must be built upon.

It is true that many people avoided the elections
and that there is indeed much hard work to be done. We
have to make sure that we win the trust of those who
ignored the elections. That will be a difficult challenge
for the new team. It is thus important for the
international community to fully support the new
authorities so that they can take up the challenges they
face.
