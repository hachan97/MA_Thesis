Mr. Safronkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Russia supported the adoption of resolution
2464 (2019), which renews the mandate of the Panel of
Experts on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
We hope that in their future work the Experts will be
strictly guided by the principles of impartiality and
objectivity and operate solely through the use ofverified
information on a basis of respectful cooperation with
all Member States.

We share the concerns expressed by the Experts in
their most recent report (see S/2019/171), as well as the
statements by representatives of many humanitarian
agencies working in the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea, with regard to the negative impact of sanctions
on the lives of the civilian population, especially the
most vulnerable segments of society, women and
children. We hope that the Committee established
pursuant to resolution 1718 (2006) will consider and
reach agreement on practical measures to correct that
abnormal situation as soon as possible. Russia welcomes
measures aimed at reaching a peaceful solution to the
problem of the Korean peninsula, and we are ready
to facilitate that. However, an important element for
success in that effort is the establishment in North-East
Asia of a sustainable security architecture, with the
participation of all the countries of the region.
