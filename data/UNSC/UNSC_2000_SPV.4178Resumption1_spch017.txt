The President: I thank Under-Secretary-General
Gambari for his briefing today. I wish to express
appreciation for his own efforts on behalf of the United
Nations to bring about a peaceful solution to the
conflict in Angola and to restore trust and confidence
between the United Nations and the Government of
Angola. We have noted from his statement that he will
be paying visits to the region in the very near future,
and we look forward to further briefings of the Council
when he returns.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Council will remain seized of the matter.

The meeting rose at 4.50 p.m.
