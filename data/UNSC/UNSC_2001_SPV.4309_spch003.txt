The President: I am very grateful to the Under-
Secretary-General, first of all for taking the trouble to
visit this very important region, and then for giving us
such an interesting briefing and update.

Before I come to open the list to members of the
Council, I should tell the Council that Sweden has
asked to be invited to participate in this discussion. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose to invite
the representative of Sweden to participate, in
accordance with the relevant provisions, unless there is
any objection.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Schori
(Sweden) took the seat reserved for him at the
side ofthe Council Chamber.

Yugoslavia will also be asked to speak to the
Council after members have intervened and the Under-
Secretary-General has answered some question. So we
will now proceed to the speakers' list for members of
the Council. I call on Ambassador Lavrov of the
Russian Federation, to be followed by Ambassador
Shen of China.
