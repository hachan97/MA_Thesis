Mr. Hume (United States of America): We are
very grateful for the briefing just provided by Under-
Secretary-General Guehenno. We would like to
congratulate the Secretariat on the progress achieved in
establishing the Temporary Security Zone and, in
particular, on the work done by Special Representative
Legwaila in dealing with the two capitals.

Deploying the Nations Mission in Ethiopia and
Eritrea (UNMEE) has become a real model for
peacekeeping operations and much of the credit goes to
the troop contributors.

The establishment of the Temporary Security
Zone is the third real milestone in the Ethiopia-Eritrea
peace process. We had the June Agreement on
Cessation of Hostilities, then the December peace
agreement, and now the Temporary Security Zone.

We are encouraged that some positive steps have
been made on the Boundary and Claims Commissions
and on the successful repatriation of prisoners of war
and internees.

The United States has worked hard with the
parties, colleagues here, the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations, UNMEE and the
Organization of African Unity to help move this
process forward. We will continue our efforts and we
support the critical work being done by UNMEE and
others. In this regard, we share the concern expressed
that the parties need to take important steps to bring
about peace and stability in their area. One of the most
important things they can do is to ensure that the return
of internally displaced persons is carried out in a
careful manner, not a precipitous one. We urge the
parties to aid UNMEE to proceed cautiously,
particularly in the light of the thousands of mines that
they have distributed generously in the area.
