Mr. Powles (New Zealand): I have the honour to
speak today on behalf of the following members of the
South Pacific Forum: Australia, Fiji, the Marshall Islands,
the Federated States of Micronesia, Papua New Guinea,
Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu and New Zealand.
Despite the length of this list, our statement is very short.

 

We welcome the focus by the Security Council on the
issue of AIDS and its impact on peace and security in
Africa. We also endorse the broadening of participation of
non-members in the work of this Council.

The sheer magnitude and severity of the AIDS
epidemic in Africa warrants urgent attention. The spread of
the disease in the region is, to borrow the words of the
Executive Director of UNAIDS, nothing short of an
unprecedented human disaster, eroding human, social and
economic development and needing a response of
emergency proportions.

In his 1998 report on the causes of conflict and the
promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in
Africa (S/1998/318), the Secretary-General recognized that
AIDS and the public health crisis facing Africa have
serious consequences for the economic and social progress
which is central to reducing conflict in the region.

AIDS is a global problem. It does not recognize
national borders. It is therefore imperative that a concerted
global effort be made by the international community to
combat this disease around the world, but the scale of the
problem in Africa makes that region's needs unique.

Through our membership in United Nations funds and
programmes and the specialized agencies active in this
field, the countries of the South Pacific will continue to
support all efforts for effective measures to combat the
spread of this disease.

Our South Pacific region is about as distant from
Africa as can be. But as they face these awesome
challenges, we would like to underline our solidarity with
our friends in Africa.
