The President (spoke in Spanish): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Alvaro de Soto, Under-Secretary-
General and Special Adviser to the Secretary-General
on Cyprus.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Alvaro de Soto to take a seat at the
Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on his mission of good
offices in Cyprus, contained in document 5/2003/398.

The Security Council will hear a briefing by Mr.
Alvaro de Soto, Under-Secretary-General and Special
Adviser to the Secretary-General on Cyprus. I welcome
him and give him the floor.
