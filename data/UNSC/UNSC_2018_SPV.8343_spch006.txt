Mr. Alotaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): We
listened carefully to the important and detailed
briefing by the Permanent Representative of the United
Kingdom, Ambassador Karen Pierce, with regard to
the latest results of the investigations into the Salisbury
incident on 4 March. Those investigations recently
identified the potential perpetrators.

I would like to commend the comprehensive and
professional manner in which the investigations to
identify the perpetrators of that heinous crime were
carried out. I reiterate our confidence in all the actions
and measures taken by the United Kingdom as part of
the investigations into that incident.

In that regard, we underscore our principled position
in condemning the use of chemical weapons - by any
party, at any time and wherever it may occur - as a
grave violation of international law. We stress the need
to hold those responsible for such use accountable,
whether they be individuals, entities, groups or
Governments. We also condemn the production,
acquisition, stockpiling, possession or direct and
indirect transfer of such weapons, pursuant to Article 1
of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which the State
of Kuwait joined in 1997.

We express our confidence in the professionalism,
independence and transparency of the Organization for
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. We underscore
the need to build up its capacity and potential in order
to carry out its tasks and shoulder its responsibilities.
That would strengthen the non-proliferation regime in
the area of investigating the use of such weapons and
identifying those responsible for violating it.

In conclusion, we stress the need to uphold
international law and norms and to maintain
international peace and security, in accordance with the
Charter of the United Nations. We urge all the parties
concerned to cooperate with all the investigations under
way with regard to this incident.
