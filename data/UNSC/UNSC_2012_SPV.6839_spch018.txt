Mr. Osorio (spoke in Spanish): I would just like
to thank the members of the Council for their support
and recognition of the work of the Security Council
Committee established pursuant to resolution 1737
(2006), the Panel of Experts and the Secretariat, which
provides us with its unflagging support.

As we said, the purpose of the open briefing at the
open meeting on 9 July, which I spoke about earlier,
was to promote cooperation among all Member States
of the Organization in ensuring compliance with the
sanctions regimes of the Council and the International
Atomic Energy Agency and their various decisions.
That cooperation is fundamental to our ability to
preserve order and to address the serious concerns
that Council members have expressed here today about
the expansion of Iran's nuclear programme, including
uranium enrichment and other related activities. In
accordance with its mandate, the Committee will
continue to work in as objective and transparent a way
as possible to fulfil all provisions set out by the Council.
