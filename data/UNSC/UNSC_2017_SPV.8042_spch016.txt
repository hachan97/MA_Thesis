The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as the representative of Ethiopia.

We welcome the unanimous adoption of resolution
2375 (2017), which we believe is an appropriate
response by the Security Council following the series
of provocative actions by the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea that represent a dangerous escalation
of the situation on the Korean peninsula. The most
recent action by the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea has made the situation even more dangerous.
It is absolutely vital that we continue to maintain
Council unity with regard to this very serious matter,
which easily has the potential to get out of hand with
all of the consequences that that possibility implies.
The resolution just adopted is very mindful of that
in underscoring its concern that developments on the
Korean peninsula could have dangerous, large-scale
and regional security implications. We are pleased
that it is this awareness that explains the unity within
the Council we continue to see. That was amply
demonstrated in the result of the negotiations, of which
this resolution is an affirmation.

We believe that there is no military solution to the
crisis on the Korean peninsula, and we hope that this
resolution and the unity among Council members will
facilitate the search for a comprehensive diplomatic
solution, which is sufficiently stressed in the resolution.
All efforts should be made to ensure that that happen
sooner rather than later, as the alternative to a peaceful
solution of the crisis is - to put it mildly - hardly a
viable option.

Let me conclude my brief comments by expressing
appreciation for the flexibility demonstrated by all
those who played an active part in the finalization of
this resolution and for the wisdom that is so manifest in
the final product.

I now resume my functions as President of the Council.

I give the floor to the representative of the Republic
of Korea.
