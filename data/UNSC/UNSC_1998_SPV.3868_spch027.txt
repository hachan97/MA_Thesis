Mr. Babar (Pakistan): It is a pleasure, Sir, to see
you presiding over the meeting of the Security Council
today. We note with satisfaction that the Council has
taken a number of important decisions under your
presidency during the current month.

The situation in Kosovo is a matter of great concern
for the international community. The reign of terror let
loose by the Serbian forces in Kosovo has resulted in the
killing of a large number of civilians, including women,
children and the elderly. We are deeply concerned that the
Serbian forces have yet again resorted to "ethnic
cleansing", which should be deplored by the international
community in the strongest possible terms.

The Government of Pakistan strongly condemns the
genocide of the ethnic Albanians by the Serbian forces in
Kosovo. Pakistan also strongly condemns terrorism in all
its forms and manifestations, whether perpetrated against
the people of Kashmir, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Palestine
or Kosovo.

The Serbian forces should immediately cease their
coercive action against the people of Kosovo and take
steps to protect and promote internationally accepted
norms of human rights. We must not allow the
perpetrators of heinous crimes against humanity to go
unpunished.
The Government of Pakistan supports the measures
proposed by the Security Council in the resolution it has
adopted today. The international community must not
allow a repetition of genocide and "ethnic cleansing" by
alien oppressors anywhere in the world.
