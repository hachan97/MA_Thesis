Mr. Lewicki (Poland): Poland voted in favour of
resolution 2428 (2018), and we regret that we were
unable to reach a consensus on that important text.
We supported the resolution because we are appalled
by the continuing violence in South Sudan, and we
believe that it is the Security Council's responsibility to
introduce adequate measures within its capacity with
a view to scaling down and preventing the ongoing
human tragedy in South Sudan.

Poland appreciates the regional efforts of African
leaders and their leadership of the Intergovernmental
Authority on Development in elaborating a viable
political solution to the conflict and ending civil war in
South Sudan. We see the measures adopted today by the
security Council as an important means to advance the
peace process. We believe that stopping the uncontrolled
flow of arms to the territory of South Sudan will result
in a decrease in the number of clashes on the ground
and violations of the ceasefire, but more important, it
will significantly reduce violence and brutality against
civilians. It is the resolution's key objective to protect
civilians. In its previous resolutions, the Council has
made it clear that the fighting in South Sudan must
stop and that there will be consequences for those who
violate the ceasefire and obstruct the peace process.
We welcome the fact that today the Security Council
decided to put its words into actions.

Lastly, let me extend my delegation's very warm
welcome to the new Permanent Representative of Cote
d'Ivoire, and we look forward to working with him and
with his excellent team very closely.
