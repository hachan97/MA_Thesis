We can cross this finish line together today, knowing that humanitarian aid will cross Syria's borders tomorrow. Millions of people will continue to get the help that they so desperately need. The tireless efforts of Belgium and Germany - their Permanent Representatives and teams - have ensured another one-year lifeline to the people in Idlib. We thank them for their dedication, and we pay our highest respects to all the humanitarian workers on the ground. This final compromise was not easy to reach. Moscow once again used delaying tactics, trying to create friction among Council members, who had already twice voted in favour of the co-penholders' proposals, only to see those draft texts vetoed twice by Russia and China. That was the direct result of Moscow pursuing its political and military goals in Syria instead of standing up to protect humanitarian principles. We condemned that kind of irresponsible playing with human lives in January (see S/PV.8700), and we do so again today. Moving from four crossings half a year ago to one today will have disastrous consequences for millions of civilians in Syria. Like many others present, we voted in favour of the co-penholders' resolution 2533 (2020) today for one reason only - so that these people could stay alive and resist this injustice.
