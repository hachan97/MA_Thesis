The President (interpretation from Spanish): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina in which he
requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the
item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the discussion
without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Misie (Bosnia and Herzegovina) took the place reserved for him at
the side of the Council Chamber.

The President (interpretation from Spanish): The next
speaker is the representative of Brazil. I invite him to take
a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
