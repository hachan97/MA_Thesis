Mr. De Rivero (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): Peru
welcomes Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of
Liberia, and congratulates her on having restored
democracy in her country and on her election as the
first woman President of an African country.

Her election as President of Liberia is a
demonstration of the progress that can be achieved
when the international community works in unison in
the context of respect for human rights and democracy.
Her democratic election in a post-conflict situation is
of far-reaching importance, not just to Liberia, but also
to all of Africa and the entire international community.

I congratulate her once again on having
established a Truth and Reconciliation Commission
and restructured her country's Supreme Court. We
believe that the success of democracy in Liberia
commits us to ensuring the viability of her country.
The holding of elections should be just one phase in a
wide-ranging programme or compact for the rebuilding
of Liberia, involving cooperation on security, the rule
of law, governance and economic recovery. In the
economic sphere, the sanctions need to be lifted, much
more economic assistance must be forthcoming, debts
forgiven, and foreign investment attracted so as to
promote trade in Liberia.

Peru supports the Secretary-General's proposal to
extend the presence of the United Nations Mission in
Liberia (UNMIL) until 31 March 2007, without
prejudice to an assessment of further extensions, as
circumstances may warrant.

In conclusion, I wish to say that Peru once again
reaffirms its strongest support for Liberia and will
continue to participate by providing military personnel
to UNMIL.
