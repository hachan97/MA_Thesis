Mr. Dejammet (France) (interpretation from French):
Unfortunately, violence and instability continue to affect the
Great Lakes region. Civilian populations are terrorized,
attacked and taken hostage. This climate of insecurity
obstructs national reconciliation and jeopardizes economic
reconstruction. Rwanda is a particular Victim of these tragic
events.

Illicit flows of weapons fuel and maintain the
violence. In September 1995 the Security Council decided
to establish an International Commission of Inquiry to
investigate arms trafficking in violation of the relevant
resolutions of the Security Council. The Commission
submitted three reports, but its activities were interrupted
because of the tragic events in eastern Zaire. The
persistence of armed action in Rwanda fully justifies the
Commission's resuming its activities and making
recommendations to the Security Council on measures that
could be taken.

That is the thrust of the draft resolution on which the
Council is about to take action; France will vote in favour
of that text.
