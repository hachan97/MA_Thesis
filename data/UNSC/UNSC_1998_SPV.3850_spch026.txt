Mr. Essonghe (Gabon) (interpretation from French):
My delegation congratulates you, Sir, on the skill with
which you have presided over the work of the Security
Council. I have no doubt that, under your presidency, our
work will be successful. I also congratulate your
predecessor on the verve with which he too guided the
work of the Council. My greetings go also to all other
members of the Council.

 

My delegation takes this opportunity to express its full
support for the draft resolution on which the Security
Council is about to take action. In our view, the United
Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) is vital and
must therefore be given all the means necessary to
complete its task. We believe it essential to strengthen the
Mission's military and administrative capacity.

We are pleased to note that in several paragraphs the
draft resolution calls upon the Government of Angola and,
most particularly, upon UNITA to cooperate fully in
ensuring the success of MONUA, inter alia by taking every
step to adhere to the timetable upon which they have
agreed. We consider also that the long-awaited meeting, on
Angolan soil, of the two main leaders would constitute a
major step forward towards a final settlement of the
conflict. We therefore support the recommended three-
month extension of the mandate of MONUA.

We are pleased to note that the draft resolution
highlights the need to continue programmes for the
demobilization and social reintegration of ex-combatants: if
these programmes are not completed, peace will remain
fragile.

I cannot conclude my statement without thanking the
Secretary-General for his report or without conveying our
thanks to the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General, Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye.
