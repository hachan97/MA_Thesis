Mr. Inchauste Jordan (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): Seven years have elapsed
since the beginning of this war, and the suffering of
the Syrian people continues to worsen. The numerous
human lives lost in recent weeks add to the more
than 500,000 lost since the beginning of the conflict.
We believe that while military tactics prevail over a
political solution, there can be no lasting peace, and
consequently it will be civilians, especially women
and children, who will continue to be subjected to
unnecessary suffering. For that reason, we commend
the adoption of resolution 2401 (2018), and hope that
its timely and effective implementation will help to
alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people.

My delegation underscores and commends the
arduous work undertaken by the penholders. The
delegations of Sweden and Kuwait have demonstrated
strong leadership and resolve up to the very last
moment to reach an agreement. Similarly, we wish to
acknowledge the effort and commitment shown by the
Russian Federation and the parties involved, as well
as all members of the Security Council during the
negotiation process.

In recent days, my delegation has expressed its
position on the matter at hand, and today we do so once
again. Consensus and unity within the Security Council
are pivotal if we are to improve the humanitarian
situation in Syria, which is why we commend the
consensus reached today. We reiterate that there can be
no military solution to the situation and that the only
way forward is through inclusive political dialogue. We
thefaffirm our support for the Geneva process and the
achievements made in Astana, of which the agreements
must be upheld by all parties. Moreover, we have high
expectations that the various forums of dialogue, such
as the Sochi dialogue, can contribute to the achievement
ofa final and lasting peace.
