The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

In a letter dated 9 July 2011 addressed to the
Secretary-General, the President of the Republic of
South Sudan submitted the application of his country
for membership in the United Nations. That letter has
been circulated as an attachment to a note by the
Secretary-General contained in document S/2011/418.
Under the provisions of rule 59 of the provisional
rules of procedure of the Security Council, unless the
Council decides otherwise, an application for
membership shall be referred by the President of the
Council to the Committee on the Admission of New
Members. Accordingly, unless I hear a proposal to the
contrary, I shall refer the application of the Republic of
South Sudan to the Committee on the Admission of
New Members for examination and report.

As I hear no objection, it is so decided.

I would propose that the Committee on the
Admission of New Members meet upon the
adjournment of this meeting, in the Security Council
Chamber, to consider the application of the Republic of
South Sudan for membership in the United Nations.

The meeting rose at 3.20 p.m.
