The President: Let me highlight the
representative of Australia's important appeal to all
countries to overcome their differences and to pool
their efforts in order to speed up the implementation of
recommendations on strengthening the United Nations
peacekeeping operations.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Brazil. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
