President Chiluba: Let me apologize, because
originally I was told to make a statement and leave. I did
not prepare my mind, and I find it a little difficult to
respond. Let me just say that it seems the spirit is very
much alive. All the contributions that have been made by
various ambassadors point to one thing: that there is
readiness, willingness and goodwill to help us resolve the
problem in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in
Burundi and in all other troubled areas of our region,
including Angola.

Mr. President, I can only encourage you. We are
determined; we are going back; we will have meetings;
we want to follow this up. We want to implement the
whole peace process. We are especially very afraid that
if the internal dialogue under Sir Ketumine Masire does
not succeed, this might bring about skirmishes and start
the fighting all over again. So, we want the United
Nations to move. All the ambassadors have said so. Less
rhetoric and more action: I think this is the message for
all of us.

I want to thank all the ambassadors who have
spoken - the Ambassadors of China, France, Malaysia
and Mali. I will take the message back home to the
region that the Security Council is more willing than
before to assist in this matter.
