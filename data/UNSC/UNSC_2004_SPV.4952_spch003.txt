The President: I thank Ambassador Brahimi for
his very comprehensive briefing.

I take this opportunity to welcome the presence
of the Secretary-General at this meeting.

In accordance with the understanding reached in
the Council's prior consultations, I should now like to
invite Council members to informal consultations to
continue our discussion of the subject.

The meeting rose at 4.15 p.m.
