Mr. Liu Yang (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
thanks President Meron and Prosecutor Brammertz
for the reports on the recent work of the International
Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals. During
the reporting period, the judicial activities of the
International Residual Mechanism for Criminal
Tribunals continued to make headway, as Residual
Mechanism judges issued a total of 244 orders and
decisions. Trial proceedings continue to advance in
the cases Prosecutor v. Jovica Stanisic' and Franko
Simatovic', Prosecutor v. Radovan Karadzie and
Prosecutor v. Ratko Mladic. In the case Prosecutor
v. Maximilien Turinabo et al., prosecution has started
regarding the alleged contempt of court by Turinabo
and others. The Office of the Prosecutor is making
further efforts to hunt down the fugitives indicted by
the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. China
hopes that the Residual Mechanism will take further
effective measures to expedite its legal proceedings and
effectively comply with the Council's requirements that
the Mechanism be small, temporary and efficient.

Last March the United Nations Office of Internal
Oversight Services reviewed the methods and the
work of the Mechanism. China has taken note of the
efforts made by the Mechanism in implementing the
recommendations of the Office. We hope that the
Mechanism will continue to take those recommendations
into consideration as it steadily improves its work.

As the current President ofthe Residual Mechanism,
Judge Meron, will conclude his term on 18 January 2019,
China wishes to express its deep appreciation for the
work that he has accomplished during his tenure. China
will also actively support the work of the incoming
President, Judge Agius.

In conclusion, I wish to take this opportunity to
thank Peru, Chair of the Informal Working Group on
International Tribunals, and the United Nations Office
of Legal Affairs for coordinating the work between the
Council and the Residual Mechanism.
