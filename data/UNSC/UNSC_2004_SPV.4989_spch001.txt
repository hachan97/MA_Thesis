The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
operation in Cyprus, contained in document
S/2004/427.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2004/484, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.

I should like to inform the Council that, in my
capacity as President of the Council, I have met with
the representatives of the parties, who have confirmed
to me that they maintain their well-known positions
vis-a-vis the item on the Council's agenda. On the
basis of those meetings, as President, with the consent
of the members of the Council, I have drawn the
conclusion that the Council can proceed to take a
decision on the draft resolution before it. Unless I hear
any objection, I shall now put the draft resolution to
the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

A vote was taken by ShOW of hands.

In favour:
Algeria, Angola, Benin, Brazil, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Pakistan, Philippines,

Romania, Russian Federation, Spain, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,

The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1548 (2004).

I shall now give the floor to those members who
wish to make statements following the voting.
