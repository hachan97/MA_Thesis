Mr. Pavlichenko (Ukraine) (spoke in Russian):
I wish to thank the representative of the Russian
Federation for his questions. With regard to
his first question, I can tell him decisively that
Ukraine is participating actively in the work of the
intergovernmental commission investigating the
incident. My Government is cooperating in good faith
with its international partners. I believe that a report on
the Commission's work and the initial findings of the
investigation is to be published in the near future.

As for the Russian representative's second
question, I would like to say the following. Our
President, including at the meeting with the Russian
President in Minsk, has spoken clearly of our readiness
for further dialogue in resolving the situation in eastern
Ukraine. It was clearly stated that we are ready to
engage in negotiations on a whole range of issues. The
only topic that cannot be discussed is the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of Ukraine and our European
integration, which is what our people desire and have
decided upon.
