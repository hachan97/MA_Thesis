Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Russia supported today's presidential
statement S/PRST/2017/24, echoing the voices of those
who are gravely concerned by reports of incidents of
migrants being sold into slavery in Libya. However,
the authors of the text, bowing to the opinions of some
Council members, refused to take into account one
important addition to the draft statement that had been
proposed by the Russian delegation.

We are convinced that the Security Council
should have condemned the circumstances that
created the current legal chaos in Libya, leading to
alleged manifestations of slavery. We understand the
extent to which some did not wish to recognize their
responsibility for the far-reaching consequences of
the 2011 military intervention. For years now, we have
had to cherish the hope that the United Nations would
help the Libyans to achieve national reconciliation and
re-establish the country's unity.

The meeting rose at 9.50 am.
