President Grybauskaite: During the past month
we have witnessed shocking developments in the world,
including virtually open warfare in various parts of the
planet. It is sad, but we must speak not only of simple
military actions but also of a collision of ideologies
and sometimes even of civilizations. The Islamic State
of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) is led by an ideology of
hatred and madness that includes ethnic and religious
cleansing and disrespect for all minorities and different
people.

Today we are dealing with a phenomenon that
crosses State boundaries and even destroys States.
Moreover, fighters from other countries are becoming
ever more involved. Unfortunately, foreign terrorist
fighters can be found not only in ISIL. Recently,
Europe has also faced violations of State borders, broad
civilian casualties and the destruction of democratic
institutions. If we want to stop that global trend, we
must truly act together.

Today, in adopting resolution 2178 (2014), we have
not only condemned foreign terrorist fighters, but also
called upon all States to take measures to stop them.
Additionally, we must understand that to keep ISIL's
ideology from spreading even further, we must ensure
viable Iraqi State institutions, tackle the humanitarian
situation and help regional States to fight terrorism
themselves.

Finally, Lithuania reaffirms its full commitment
to support all efforts in the fight against terrorism
throughout the world.
