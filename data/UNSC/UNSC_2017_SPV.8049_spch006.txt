Mr. Kawamura (Japan): We welcome the unanimous
adoption of resolution 2377 (2017). Japan is pleased to
have co-sponsored it.

The first United Nations Mission in Colombia has
been a model of success. We commend the Mission for
its efficient responsible work, including in the process
ofthe laying down of arms. This success was built on the
strong commitment to the Peace Agreement by both the
Government and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias
de Colombia.

The United Nations Verification Mission in
Colombia will also rely on the continued commitment
and determination of all parties, including on economic
and social integration, security guarantees and the full
observance of the peace agreement. The whole-of-
United Nations approach will remain critical.

Japan reiterates its support for the parties to
implement the peace agreement and will closely follow
the work of the second Mission.
