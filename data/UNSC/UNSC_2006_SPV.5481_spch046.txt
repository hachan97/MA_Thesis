The President: Before I give the floor to the next
speaker, I should like to inform the Council that I have
received letters from the representatives of Pakistan
and Saudi Arabia in which they request to be invited to

participate in the consideration of the item on the
Council's agenda. In accordance with the usual practice
I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite
those representatives to participate in the consideration
of the item without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The representatives of the aforementioned
countries took the seats reserved for them at the
side of the Council Chamber.

The President: I now call on the representative
of Lebanon.
