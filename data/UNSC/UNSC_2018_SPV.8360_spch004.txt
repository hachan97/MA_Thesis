Mrs. Gregoire Van Haaren (Netherlands): Today
the Security Council is sending a strong and clear
message in support of wider efforts to improve and
strengthen United Nations peacekeeping. Last week's
debate on peacekeeping (see S/PV.8349) provided
ample evidence for the timely nature and necessity of
resolution 2436 (2018). We all know that peacekeeping
faces serious challenges, that many United Nations
missions are operating in complex and dangerous
environments and that the high number of casualties
under peacekeepers is worrisome. At the same time,
improving performance demands our continuous
attention in the broader context of peacekeeping
reform. Today's resolution is an important step
towards promoting better support for Blue Helmets and
ensuring effective protection for civilians. I would like
to highlight three important aspects of the resolution.

Innovative force-generation is a way to improve the
performance of operations. Moreover, this resolution
pleads for well trained and equipped personnel with
the right capabilities to implement the tasks mandated
by the Security Council. It includes accountability for
underperformance and acts of sexual exploitation and
abuse. That includes a wide range of measures that could
be taken, including repatriation, and, most important,
it requires a culture change in missions. At the same
time, excellence should be rewarded. In that regard,
we welcome reporting on outstanding performance.
We must continue to learn from lessons, positive
and negative. It is a positive sign that the Council
managed to agree on this resolution unanimously, since
peacekeeping is the Council's main and most visible
instrument when it comes to conflict management.
Today we managed to take another significant step
towards making peacekeeping fit for purpose.
