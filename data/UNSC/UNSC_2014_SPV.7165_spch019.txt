Mr. Sergeyev (Ukraine): I thank you for convening
this meeting, Madam President, and for the opportunity
to address the Security Council. I would also like
to thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his
briefing, and all the members of the Council for their
statement.

It has been a month since Russia illegally occupied
and annexed Crimea, using its military forces and
brutally violating international law. Unfortunately,
Russia has not stopped there, and apparently its leaders
are now targeting other parts of Ukraine and brazenly
interfering in its internal affairs. The agreements
reached at the Geneva meeting of the Foreign Ministers
of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the United States
and the European Union on 17 April provided a faint
beam of hope for a diplomatic solution.

In order to implement the Geneva statement for
the de-escalation of the situation in the eastern regions
of Ukraine, the Government of Ukraine immediately
took the necessary practical steps. Within just one
week, the Government suspended the active phase of
its anti-terrorist operation, whose main objective was
the restoration of law and order and the protection of
civilians. It initiated constitutional reform. It approved
the concept of local administrative reform, whose main
principles are decentralizing power in the country,
significantly empowering local communities and
improving management at the regional and district
levels. A draft law on amnesty for participants in the
uprisings in the eastern regions has been prepared and
would apply to those protesters who surrender their
weapons and evacuate illegally seized administrative
buildings, except for those suspected of committing
serious crimes. The parliamentary coalition has invited
all political parties represented in the Ukrainian
Parliament to sign a memorandum of understanding
on ways to resolve the situation in eastern Ukraine.
The Minister of Internal Affairs and Security Services
has continued implementing a nationwide campaign to
seize illegal arms from the population, and more than
6,000 weapons have been handed over recently. Ukraine
is demonstrating its commitment to constructive
cooperation with human-rights institutions and
international organizations.

What has Russia done for its part of the Geneva
document? It has done nothing. Because of the lack
of support for the separatists among the population
of eastern Ukraine, Russia is seeking new ways to
destabilize the situation in the region, preparing and
carrying out numerous armed provocations through its
agents. Russian-sponsored illegal paramilitary units
have continued to destabilize the situation in eastern
Ukraine, preparing the ground for a new stage of military
aggression. The Russian leadership has done nothing
to publicly dissociate itself from the armed separatists
and provocateurs or to urge them to immediately lay
down their arms and release captured administrative
buildings. Russia has not even condemned the seizure
of hostages, including journalists, or separatists' open
acts of xenophobia and anti-Semitism. Any attempts by
Russia to show that the Ukrainian Government is trying
to use force against the peaceful Ukrainian population
are lies.

Our Government respects freedom of expression
and the right to peaceful assembly, which are
guaranteed by the Constitution of Ukraine. However,
when heavily armed, professionally trained groups led
by Russian military seize law-enforcement facilities
and administrative offices, kill Ukrainian police
officers and take hostages, they are operating like
terrorists and must be treated accordingly. Ukrainian
counter-terrorism operations are targeted exclusively at
illegal armed groups threatening civilians. Meanwhile,
the Russian-controlled army groups are in fact holding
the entire civilian population of several towns in the
eastern region hostage and have thus transgressed the
bounds of humanity.

I will list some facts. Three Ukrainian law-
enforcement officers were abducted, brutally beaten,
tortured and later presented to the Russian media as
Ukrainian spies, blindfolded and with their hands
tied. Ukrainian and foreign journalists are being
systematically kidnapped, while Russian journalists are
allowed to operate in the areas controlled by the illegal
armed groups. A military helicopter was destroyed
with a man-portable air defence (MANPAD) guided
missile. It should be understood that peaceful protesters
cannot buy MANPADs in shops. Representatives of
the military verification mission of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were
taken hostage in Sloviansk. The detention by force of
international observers is yet another testament to the
criminal and terrorist nature of the separatist armed
groups. In contrast to the demand voiced in many of the
statements in the Council today that those hostages be
released, the Russian Federation, as might be expected,
made no such demand; nor have its leaders in Moscow.

What is important is that the leaders of the illegal
armed groups have publicly admitted responsibility for
all the aforementioned crimes * even on television.
Many members of the illegal militant groups are citizens
of the Russian Federation, and they are not even trying
to hide it, publicly displaying their identification. We
recently read an article in The New York Times in which
the Kuban Cossack Mozhaev declared his presence and
that of an armed group from his region, which we had
noticed in Crimea as well.

Ukrainian law-enforcement agencies have credible
evidence of these persons' involvement in serious
crimes. Today, some ofthose crimes have been described.
Among them was the brutal story of Volodymyr Rybak,
a member of Horlivka's City Council, and Yuriy
Popravko, a l9-year-old activist from Kyiv, who were
martyred by members of terrorist groups. Their bodies,
mutilated by torture, were found in the Torets River in
the vicinity of Sloviansk. Volodymyr Rybak disappeared
on 17 April in Horlivka after he tried to remove the
separatists' flag from the building of Horlivka City
Council. A video of the kidnapping, as well as audio
recordings of phone conversations intercepted by
Ukraine's Security Service, provided sufficient proof
that terrorist leaders, notably the self-proclaimed
mayor of Sloviansk, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, and the
military commander of the terrorists, the Russian agent
Igor Strelkov, were involved in the murder. The true
identity of the Russian agent has been established as
Colonel Igor Girkin of Russian military intelligence,
who is registered as a permanent resident of Moscow.

The Government of Ukraine strongly condemns the
aforementioned acts of terror and violence, including
yesterday's attempt to assassinate the Mayor of Kharkiv,
Hennadiy Kernes, who publicly supported the unity and
territorial integrity of Ukraine. Unfortunately, Russia
has not even publicly condemned or dissociated itself
from those acts of terror and violence perpetrated by
illegal militants since the Geneva agreement. I would
like to remind the Council that Russia used to deny
that its armed forces participated in the occupation
of Crimea. However, President Putin now openly
admits the use of Russian military forces and praises
them for their heroism and the successful completion
of the operation aimed at the reunification of Crimea
with Russia. They have even issued a special medal of
honour. And now, in spite of numerous irrefutable facts
concerning Russian military involvement in organizing
and guiding illegal armed groups in eastern Ukraine,
Moscow denies any Russian military participation just
as hard.

Furthermore, Russia is now threatenting to use
force, as demonstrated by its concentration of armed
forces directly on the eastern border of our country. The
number of units along Ukraine's borders has increased.
Last week, we all heard intensified militaristic rhetoric
from senior Russian officials, including President Putin,
Minister Lavrov and Minister Shoigu, threatening to
send Russian troops into the territory of Ukrain under
various pretexts. Defence Minister Shoigu reported
the start of new military exercises by battalion tactical
groups from the southern and western military districts
of the Russian armed forces in connection with "the
deteriorating situation in southeastern Ukraine".
With that the Russian side has in fact confirmed that
its military activity near the Ukrainian border in the
past month has not been routine in nature, but directly
related to the developments in Ukraine. Unfortunately,
the withdrawal of troops announced by Minister Shoigu
yesterday has not come true. We still observe those
troops near our borders.

My British colleague has given us information
about the strange statement by our Russian partner
here, who said that, in case of events taking a bad
turn in Ukraine's south-east, Russia would remember
the provision to use armed forces in Ukraine given to
President Vladimir Putin by the Federation Council. He
also said that Russia had an international legal basis for
sending its peacekeeping troops into Ukraine. And he
referred to the right to self-defence under Article 51 of
the Charter of the United Nations, which Russia used
during the conflict in the Caucasus in 2008. The right
to self-defence on the territory of another country?
Let me remind him that Ukraine has never threatened
Russia, and never will. Ukrainians want to live in peace
and to be left alone. The highest level of cynicism is
the Russian reference to the right of self-defence in a
situation in which it is Russia that is acting as aggressor,
having occupied Crimea, as is brutally interfering in the
internal affairs of Ukraine, destabilizing it and trying
to create an explosive situation in the eastern regions.

Unfortunately, we are deeply concerned that the
scenario that is prepared for eastern Ukraine might be
similar to the one implemented by Russia in Abkhazia.
That scenario might include several steps.

Step one: a small group of local separatists,
supported by Russian-controlled armed groups, would
seize control over regional councils and make them
illegally proclaim the creation ofa so-called independent
Novorossiya within the boundaries described by
President Putin at his recent press interview. We have
already seen that step taken in Donetsk, Slovansk and
Kharkiv, against the will of the vast majority of the local
population and against the Ukrainian Constitution.

Step two: the Russian Federation would immediately
recognize such a regional unit as an independent State.

Step three: upon a request from the newly self-
proclaimed authorities, the Russian Federation
would send its troops to Ukraine under the guise of
peacekeepers or collective self-defence.
Unfortunately, I must say that such a scenario is
realistic, as it has been reported that some Russian
heavy military vehicles had been spotted near Ukraine's
borders bearing signs indicating "Peacekeeping
Mission" in the Russian and Ukrainian languages,
exactly as happened in Abkhazia. One of the main
purposes of that scenario is to disrupt the presidential
elections scheduled for 25 May, which are a top priority
for the Government and for the people of Ukraine.

Let me sum up my statement by making some
short conclusions. Twelve days have already passed
since the Geneva meeting. Ukraine has done its utmost
to de-escalate the situation. Our steps have been
acknowledged and supported by the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe and other parties
involved. Russia has done nothing.

How should the problem be solved? The answer is
simple: Russia has to implement the Geneva agreements.
First, Russia should withdraw its army from Ukraine's
borders. Secondly, it should make a high-level statement
calling on its prote'ges to free all hostages, to disarm
and to vacate all seized administrative premises. It
also has to condemn all terror and violence committed
by those groups and to disassociate itself from such
activities. Thirdly, it should stop its war-like rhetoric
and start to act in a constructive and civilized manner.
Last, but not least, Russia must refrain from any actions
aimed at undermining the 25 May presidential elections
in Ukraine.

We call on the Security Council to give the most
serious assessment of the actions and statements
by Russia regarding Ukraine, and to take the most
decisive steps to stop its aggressive appetite and to
protect Ukrainian territorial integrity, which has been
challenged once again.
