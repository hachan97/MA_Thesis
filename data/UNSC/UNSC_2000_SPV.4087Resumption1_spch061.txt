The President: I thank the representative of Nigeria
for his important statement. If there is no objection, I
would ask him to convey, on behalf of the entire Security
Council, our congratulations to President Obasanjo for the
new HIV committee that he established today in Nigeria.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Australia. I invite her to take a seat at
the Council table and to make her statement.
