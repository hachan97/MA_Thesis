Mr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian):
We will join our colleagues who have spoken about
President Nelson Mandela.

Russia welcomes the designation of President Mandela
as the international Facilitator in the Burundi peace talks.
We hope that this will help us to get beyond the standstill
in the political process. We would urge all Burundi parties
to cooperate closely with the international Facilitator, with
a view to a swift and positive conclusion of the process for
a peaceful settlement of the conflict.

Russia has consistently advocated solving the internal
conflict in Burundi through negotiations involving all
parties involved in it. We would call on all the Burundian
parties to refrain from acts of force, which could torpedo
the results that were achieved with such difficulty during
the Arusha process. We strongly condemn attacks by armed
groups on Bujumbura and other populated areas, which
cause civilian deaths. We also express our concern over the
continuing practice of forced displacement of civilians into
camps under military guard.

The tense situation requires measures to stimulate
negotiations involving all political forces in that country.
We confirm our view that the principal responsibility for
peace in Burundi lies with the Burundians themselves,
and we call for an intensification of efforts to achieve this
goal within Burundi itself and also within the
international, and particularly the subregional, context.

From this standpoint, Russia will support
strengthening interaction between the Security Council
and the regional participants in the peace process. In this
endeavour, we will be guided by the assessments and
views of President Mandela, who, given his status and his
prestige, is indeed a key player in the talks.
