Ms. Gahonzire: I was asked about the challenges
that female uniformed personnel are facing in peace
missions. First ofall, I would like to thank our leadership
for the uniformed gender-parity strategy, which the
Police Division is implementing. We have a road
map and, hopefully, we can achieve our objectives by
placing women with the right skills and qualifications
in the right places.

However, as I was asked, in the field, some of the
specific difficulties are related to health, given the
nature of women and the infrastructure, which, in most
cases, does not favour women. As for the rest, I can
say that there are stereotypes perpetuated by Member
States, despite the fact that they are part of the Action
for Peacekeeping initiative. Other than that, efforts are
ongoing and we are on course.
