The President: We appreciate the comments of the
representative of Ukraine concerning the role played by
General Dallaire. We will make sure that he knows fully of
the sentiments he expressed.

I think it is appropriate, in the context of this
discussion of the failure of the Security Council in
Rwanda, that I announce on behalf of the Council that we
have asked Ambassador Richard Holbrooke to lead, early
next month, a Security Council mission to the Democratic
Republic of the Congo. The mission is designed to
accelerate full acceptance and implementation of the
Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement, and to support the relevant
Security Council resolutions. I wish Ambassador
Holbrooke and his mission every success in that very
timely initiative.
