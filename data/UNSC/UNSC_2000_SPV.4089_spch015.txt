Mrs. Ogata: As I said in my statement, we would
like to augment the possibility for refugee children, and
girls in particular because they are usually more deprived
of educational opportunities at the secondary school level.
I say this because somehow in most refugee camps we
manage to provide some primary school education, but
when it gets to the secondary level, it hardly exists. We
feel that for the refugees who are temporarily outside of
education possibilities, or their own home environments,
it would be very important that they be given educational
opportunities so that once they go back home, or when
they become part of the countries of asylum -
integration - they will turn into useful citizens.

This is why it is a bit of a longer term view, but I
think we should not deprive children from being properly
educated. This is particularly special in Africa. I noted
this experience by receiving some letters from 12- and
14-year old refugee children, who really appealed for
education opportunities. And I was very touched.
