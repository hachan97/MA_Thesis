The President: There are no more names inscribed
on the list of speakers. Before concluding, I would
like to thank Assistant Secretary-General ad interim
Toynberg-Frandzen and Ambassadors Apakan and
Talgliavini for their briefings, especially given the late
hour in Kyiv and the demands on both of them on the
ground.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 4.50 pm.
