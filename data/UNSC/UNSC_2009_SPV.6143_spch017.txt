The President: I will now make a statement in
my capacity as the representative of Turkey.

Turkey believes in the necessity of the United
Nations presence in Georgia. It is for that reason that
we awaited with great expectation a positive outcome
to the negotiations within the Group of Friends.
Unfortunately, the Group was unable to come to an
understanding on the issue until last night. In order not
to cause an abrupt termination of the United Nations
presence, we agreed to co-sponsor a simple technical
rollover that would have extended the present mandate
by two more weeks. That could have provided
additional time to conduct further consultations on the
issue. Unfortunately, that was not possible. So we are
where we are now.

This should not be seen as Turkey's giving up the
efforts to provide a United Nations presence in
Georgia. There is definitely a need for a safety valve.
On the other hand, Turkey will continue to support the
unity and territorial integrity of Georgia.

I would like to take this opportunity to express
our sincere thanks to the men and women of the United
Nations Observer Mission in Georgia for their
professionalism and dedicated service since 1993.

I now resume my functions as the President of the
Council.

I give the floor to the Permanent Representative
of Georgia.
