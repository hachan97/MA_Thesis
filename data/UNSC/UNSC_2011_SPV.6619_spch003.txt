Mr. Wittig (Germany): Germany welcomed
Liberia's progress in peace consolidation and further
stabilization, and at the same time supports the United
Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) and the extension
of its mandate for a further year. In view of the
upcoming elections, UNMIL's presence is surely still
necessary. However, we hope the progress made
towards stabilization in Liberia will allow us in due
time to consider further troop reductions.

In this regard, we support the assessment mission
that will visit Liberia in early 2012. We hold the view
that the Council should then swiftly review the police
and troop strength of UNMIL, taking into account the
findings of the assessment mission. The review should
take place before the end of May 2012.

It is important that UNMIL and Liberia keep
making progress in transferring security
responsibilities from UNMIL to national authorities.
The time is ripe for this transition, and the Liberian
authority must mot lose more time in taking over
complete responsibility for security and stabilization in
the country. This is also a question of responsible
management of scarce resources.
