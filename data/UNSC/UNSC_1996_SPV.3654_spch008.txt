Mr. Queta (Guinea-Bissau) (interpretation from French): Over the past few days, intensive bombardments
have been taking place along the Israeli-Lebanese border
and within Lebanon itself, leading to heavy losses of
human life and damage to property.

Guinea-Bissau, which itself has suffered from the
ravages of war, is gravely concerned at this military
escalation and, in general, at the deterioration of the
situation in the Middle East, the effects of which could
imperil the peace process. These hostilities, whose
consequences are becoming daily more serious and more
unforeseeable, must cease immediately.

 

To this end, Guinea-Bissau will support all peace
initiatives. It encourages the initiatives being taken by
certain countries of the region, which we hope will take
into account the relevant resolutions of the Security
Council, including resolution 425 (1978).

We deplore the incidents today, which have led to
dozens of deaths in Lebanon, and we express our full
solidarity with the families of the innocent victims.

We also express our sincere support for all those who
have been affected by the military activities in the area - in
particular, the hundreds of thousands of Lebanese who
have, regrettably, been forced into an exodus within their
own country.
In the light of the grave humanitarian situation, we
wish also make an urgent appeal to the international
community to come to the aid of the victims of the war in
Lebanon.

For all those reasons, we voted in favour of both of
the draft resolutions that were before us this evening in the
hope that this would make a major contribution to the
immediate cessation of hostilities and to the continuation of
negotiations on a just and lasting peace in the region.
