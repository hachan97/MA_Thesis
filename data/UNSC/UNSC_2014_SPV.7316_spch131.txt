Mr. Safaei (Islamic Republic of Iran): The Security
Council today heard the representative ofa main sponsor
of State terrorism and the occupier of the Palestinian

territory make some unacceptable false remarks with
respect to my country. These were the same baseless
remarks that have been repeated here time and again,
and my delegation rejects them categorically. Indeed,
we should not be surprised that the representative
of a regime that is the manifestation of State terror
should accuse a nation that has witnessed the loss of
over 17,000 of its citizens during the past 35 years, a
number of whom fell victim to heinous terrorist attacks
that have been directly sponsored by elements of that
regime. A well-known example of this was the incident
in which Iranian nuclear scientists were brutally killed
before the very eyes of their terrified family members.

It is regrettable and ironic that those who are behind
the most horrific terrorist attacks of our time should
venture to preach to us about its counter-terrorism
measures. They exude terror and violence. We consider
the statement made by the representative of Israel today
to be simply a tactic to divert the public's attention
from the illegal and criminal activities that their terror
network has committed constantly for more than six
decades. But the international community cannot be so
easily deceived.
