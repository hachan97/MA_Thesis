The President: I thank Mr. Le Roy for his
briefing.

I should like to inform the Council that I have
just received a letter from the representative of the
Sudan, in which he requests to be invited to participate
in the consideration of the item on the Council's
agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the consideration of the
item, without the right to vote, in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Osman
(Sudan) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: I give the floor to the
representative of the Sudan.
