The Russian delegation voted against the draft resolution on the extension of the cross-border mechanism of humanitarian aid delivery to Syria, presented by Belgium and Germany (S/2020/654). Our position on the cross-border mechanism, established in 2014, is known and remains unchanged. It was established as an exceptional and temporary measure, approved by the Security Council to support the humanitarian relief activities in the war-torn country. It has to be gradually phased out and replaced by humanitarian deliveries, in accordance with the principles outlined in General Assembly resolution 46/182. Over the past six years, the situation on the ground has changed. The territory beyond the control of the Government of Syria has reduced drastically. However, we fully understand the need to meet the humanitarian needs of all Syrians. Guided by that, we will introduce our own draft resolution, which extends the work of the cross-border mechanism for another six months and limits the number of crossing points to one, namely, Bab Al-Hawa. With the territory in Idlib controlled by terrorist groups reduced by 30 per cent, we are confident that this border crossing can meet all essential humanitarian needs of the population in that area. The cross- border point of Bab Al-Salam was providing only 14 per cent of the overall cross- border deliveries to Idlib. At the same time, we call once again on all relevant actors, including the Syrian Government and United Nations humanitarian agencies, to engage in facilitating humanitarian deliveries to all parts of Syria by enhancing the capacity and effectiveness of cross-line supplies. We also call on our partners in the Security Council and other United Nations Member States not to politicize the humanitarian file but to swiftly adopt our draft resolution to continue providing United Nations humanitarian assistance to the population of Idlib.
