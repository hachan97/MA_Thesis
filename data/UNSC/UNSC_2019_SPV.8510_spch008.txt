The President: I will now make a statement in my
capacity as the representative of Germany.

I would like to make four points.

First, we support the extension of the United Nations
Mission for Justice Support in Haiti (MINUJUSTH) for
a final period of six months.

Secondly, I would like to echo the sentiments of
the representatives of Peru and the Dominican Republic
that the United Nations should remain engaged with
Haiti and that we should have a smooth transition to
the follow-up United Nations presence, the special
political mission, in Haiti. We believe that this is of
crucial importance.

Thirdly, in response to my Russian colleague
with regard to the relationship between Chapter VII
and human rights monitoring, we believe that the
respect for human rights is a question of security and
therefore rightfully within the mandate. The presence
of Ms. Bachelet in our discussions last week (see 
S/PV.8502) was proof of this.

Fourthly, I would like to highlight that Haiti is
among the most vulnerable countries in the world to
climate change and natural disasters. When we look

at the island from space, we can see that one half is
absolutely green and the other half has hardly any trees,
which makes this country particularly susceptible
to natural disasters. We would have liked to have
something on this issue in resolution 2466 (2019). and
we regret that this was not possible. We believe that a
future United Nations presence should provide advice
to the Haitian Government on how to strengthen the
country's resilience with respect to the challenges of

climate change.

I now resume my functions as President of the

Security Council.

There are no more names inscribed on the list

of speakers.

The meeting rose at 10.40 am.
