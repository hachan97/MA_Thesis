Mr. Rugunda (Uganda): From the outset Uganda
has underscored the importance of the Security Council
speaking with one voice on events in the Korean
peninsula following the launch of a rocket by the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea last March. We
therefore welcome the unanimity of the Council on this
matter.

Uganda voted in favour of resolution 1874 (2009)
not only because it is important to achieve non-
proliferation in the Korean peninsula, but also because
we are convinced that, together, we should work
towards the total elimination of all nuclear weapons in
order to create a more secure world.
