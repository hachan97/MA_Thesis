Mr. Wittig (Germany): I wish to warmly
welcome Ambassador Dabbashi and to congratulate
him on today's approval by the General Assembly of
his credentials. We fully support resolution 2009
(2011), just adopted. We also highly welcome its
unanimous adoption. This sends a strong message of
the unity of the Council at this important crossroads in
Libya's history. A new era has begun in Libya and is
reflected in the resolution adopted today. Most
importantly, it is guided by the ownership and
responsibility of the Libyan people. The process of
democratic transition was started by the Libyan people
and it must remain in the hands of the Libyan people.

By mandating the United Nations Support
Mission in Libya, the Council has heeded the call of
the Libyan authorities for support and advice in key
areas. As agreed by all stakeholders, the United
Nations will play the central role in coordinating
international support. Germany is ready to contribute
actively to this endeavour.

The resolution also marks an important step for
Libya's economic recovery. When the asset freeze is
lifted and modified, the local economy and trade will
be kick-started. However, this is a first step only. It is
clear that eventually all economic sanctions on those
entities under the control of the Libyan authorities will
be lifted.

With today's resolution, the Council also sends a
political message. A consultative and inclusive political
process will be key for the democratic transition of
Libya. The full participation of women in this process
should be promoted. Also, national reconciliation and
the protection of the human rights of all Libyans and
foreign workers are critical. We welcome the
Transitional National Council's repeated commitment
to that end.

To conclude, much remains to be done, but with
today's resolution, the Council has demonstrated its
strong will to support the Libyan people on their path
to a democratic and prosperous society.
