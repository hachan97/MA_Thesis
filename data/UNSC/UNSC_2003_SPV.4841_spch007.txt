Mr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): The
purpose of this meeting is to examine the seriousness
and the implications of the construction by Israel of
what is being called the wall.

The search for a solution to the Middle East
conflict requires the creation of the requisite climate of
trust between the parties, which will enable them to
emerge from the spiral of violence. We must state that
the construction of the wall in the West Bank does not
help create that atmosphere. Indeed, the route of the
wall creates problems for the vision of peace between
Israelis and Palestinians based on two States living in
peace and security. The international community has
always called on the parties not to change the situation
on the ground. Spain reiterates that.

We also cannot forget the problems created by
this measure, adopted by the Government of Israel, in
terms of international law and humanitarian law.
Regarding the latter point, we must note that this
measure and its impact, particularly in terms of
complicating land issues, is already directly affecting
the Palestinian civilian population and particularly
their movement, thus deepening the terrible
humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territories.

My delegation has often spoken against terrorism.
It has condemned here the recent attacks on the Israeli
population. Nothing justifies, nor can justify, the recent
attacks in the area, but that cannot divert us from the
basic matter before us today - the construction of the
wall in the Palestinian territories - I underscore, in the
Palestinian territories - and the confiscation of land or
the demolition of houses. Those are all illegal
activities. What is worse is that, as I said at the
beginning, they are activities that are increasingly
harmful to any effort to bring peace to the region.
