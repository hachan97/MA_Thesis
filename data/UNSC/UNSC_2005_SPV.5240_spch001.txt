The President: After consultations among
members of the Security Council, I have been
authorized to make the following statement on behalf
of the Council:

"The Security Council condemns in the
strongest possible terms the assassination today,
27 July 2005, of the two Algerian diplomats
accredited at the Algerian Embassy to Iraq,
Mr. Ali Belaroussi and Mr. Azzedine Belkadi, and
expresses its condolences to the families of the
victims and to the Government and people of
Algeria.

"The Security Council emphasizes that
there can be no justification for such terrorist acts
and underlines the need to bring to justice its
perpetrators.

"The Security Council reaffirms its
unwavering support for the Iraqi people in their
political transition, as outlined in resolution 1546
(2004). The Security Council also reaffirms Iraq's
independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial
integrity and calls upon the international
community to stand by the Iraqi people in their
pursuit of peace, stability and democracy."

This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol
S/PRST/2005/37.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 5.15p.m.
