Mr. Omaish (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): As I am
the lucky thirteenth speaker in this session, I do not
have much to say. However, I would like to join all
the previous speakers in extending our thanks and
appreciation to you, Mr. President and all the members
of your team for the able and successful manner in
which you conducted the Council's business this month.

I would like briefly to express our appreciation
for Australia's leadership during the open debate held
to discuss international cooperation in the field of
combating terrorism (see S/PV.7316) and Australia's
work on the comprehensive review of sanctions regimes.
We also value Australia's initiative to hold a debate
on the role of the police components of peacekeeping
operations (see S/PV.7317), which culminated in the
adoption of resolution 2185 (2014).

In conclusion, I would like to welcome the Chadian
presidency and to wish it every success in conducting
the Council's business next month.
