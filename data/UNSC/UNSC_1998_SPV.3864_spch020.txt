Mr. Dangue Rewaka (Gabon) (interpretation from French): The world still remembers the explosion of a Pan
Am Boeing 747 that occurred on 21 December 1988 over
Lockerbie, Scotland. As soon as this tragedy was reported,
Gabon expressed its heartfelt emotion and profound
compassion to the cruelly bereaved families of the victims.

The investigations that were launched established the
terrorist origins of the explosion of that aircraft and led to
the identification of two suspects of Libyan nationality.

Consistent with its principles, Gabon firmly
condemned this hateful act and reaffirmed the vital need to
combat all forms of terrorism. Following the attack, the
Security Council adopted and imposed sanctions against
Libya.

Despite the firmness thus displayed by the Council, we
must recognize that the most vulnerable sectors of the
Libyan population have been punished more than those
allegedly responsible for the criminal act. This, inter alia,
is confirmed in the report of the mission sent to Libya by
the Secretary-General.

The families of the victims, some of whom are among
us here today, impatiently wait for justice to be done and
reparations to be made. The current status quo serves
neither their legitimate expectations nor the interests of
justice. The time has therefore come to find a peaceful and
lasting solution to this crisis.

In this respect, the options submitted jointly by the
Organization of African Unity and the League of Arab
States seem to us to be an acceptable compromise. They
would require that the suspects be tried in a third and
neutral country chosen by the Security Council; that the
suspects be tried in accordance with Scottish law by
Scottish judges at the International Court of Justice at The
Hague; and that a special penal tribunal be established to
try the suspects at the headquarters of the International
Court of Justice at The Hague.
