Mr. Qin Huasun (China) (interpretation from Chinese): The current situation in Sierra Leone is not
something the international community wishes to see. It has
also inflicted enormous suffering on the people of Sierra
Leone.

Since last May, the Security Council has on many
occasions considered the question of Sierra Leone. It has
issued three presidential statements and twice listened to
briefings given by the Foreign Ministers of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS). During
this period, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and
ECOWAS have made numerous mediation efforts.

Like other Council members, the Chinese delegation
is concerned at the changes in the situation in Sierra Leone
and feels deep sympathy for the sufferings experienced by
the people of that country. We appreciate the mediation
efforts of the United Nations, the OAU and especially
ECOWAS, and we support them in their efforts to seek a
peaceful means of resolving the problems in Sierra Leone.

China has always taken a cautious approach to
sanctions. We hope that the measures contained in the draft
resolution before us will be conducive to an early and
peaceful settlement of the question of Sierra Leone and will
not cause any humanitarian difficulties for its people. Based
on these considerations, and acting out of respect for the
African countries and their wish that an early settlement be
found to the question of Sierra Leone, China will vote in
favour of the draft resolution.
