The President (spoke in Russian): On behalf of
the delegation of the Russian Federation, I would like
to express sincere appreciation to the members of
the Council, especially my colleagues the Permanent
Representatives, their Deputies and colleagues, as well
as the staff of the secretariat of the Security Council,
for all of the support that they have given to us.

In this busy month, we have managed to reach
consensus on several important issues, although not
all. We could not have done it alone or without the hard
work, support and constructive contributions of every
delegation and representative of the secretariat, as well
as the interpreters, translators, meeting services and
sound engineers, in addition to security officers, who
kept the Council safe this month.

As we end our presidency, I know I speak on behalf
of the Council in wishing the delegation of Senegal
good luck in the month of November.

The meeting rose at 1.10 pm.
