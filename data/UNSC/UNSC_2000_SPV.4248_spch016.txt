Mr. Cunningham (United States): The Council
has acted wisely this evening on an ill-timed and
inappropriate draft resolution. The draft resolution
failed because it lacks sufficient support, as the vote
shows. Had there been a chance of it passing, my
delegation would have cast a veto.

The Council's lack of support for and refusal to
adopt the proposed resolution is an important signal.
Now is the time to support renewal of negotiations and
dialogue, and not for actions that will not in fact
advance the cause of peace and that do not have the
consent of the parties.

Israeli and Palestinian delegations arrived tonight
in Washington and talks begin tomorrow. We will work
hard to help rebuild confidence and trust and to restore
dialogue, and we will also work hard to support what
Palestinians and Israelis agree would be useful. That
should be our common focus, and that will have the
most positive and salutary effect on the ground.
