Mr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): Following the horrible
chemical weapons attack in Idlib in Syria on 4 April,
we have all had several opportunities to express our
national positions on the matter. Today, Ukraine
voted in favour of the draft resolution condemning
that heinous crime and demanding its immediate and
thorough investigation. Any use of chemical weapons
is a flagrant violation of international law and a war
crime. The Security Council should therefore act
swiftly and resolutely in response to the continuous
massive attacks, thus preventing further attempts to
commit such abhorrent crimes, as well as eradicating
the chemical threat in the region. That has not
happened, and today I feel ashamed, because this
body has failed to do its job. It failed again today as
images of dying children lay in front of us, and at a
time when the world expects the Security Council to
act in the aftermath of a horrible crime. The vote was
a test of the Council's credibility, and we did not pass.
What we have just heard from the Russian delegation
epitomizes that failure and is symbolic of the Council's
inability to do the right thing, even in cases of the
most outrageous international crimes. The Council's
continued inability to address chemical attacks in Syria
is leading to further impunity and sending a signal to
perpetrators that they can get away with murder. We
deeply regret that today the Council missed yet another
chance to fulfil its responsibilities under the Charter of
the United Nations.

Despite the voting results, I commend the efforts
of those delegations that were involved in preparing
the draft resolution, which sought a comprehensive and
thorough investigation of that tragedy. We appreciate
the fact that a firm stance in defending and restoring
respect for justice and international law won the support
of the majority of Council members, notwithstanding
the attempts of some delegations to distort the facts.
