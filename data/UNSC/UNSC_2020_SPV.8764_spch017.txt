The President (spoke in Russian): I thank the representative of Germany. However, I would like to draw the Council's attention to the fact that I have two proposals on the table and we have to decide which of those proposals we are going to vote on. The representative of China clearly stated his preference regarding what wording we should vote on. Therefore, before we vote on the substance, we should understand what we are voting on. Therefore, to begin with, we should understand whether we are voting, because it was proposed first, on the wording as proposed by the United Kingdom, which was then supported by other members. What is the purpose of this vote? The purpose is that we have a question. Are the members of the Council ready to vote on the wording proposed by the representative of the United Kingdom? To vote on wording proposed by the United Kingdom, there must be nine votes in support of that proposal. Should that pass, then we will vote on the wording proposed by the United Kingdom. Should it not pass, we shall of course proceed to the second option. I cannot take the second option off the table. The representative of the United Kingdom has asked to make a further statement.
