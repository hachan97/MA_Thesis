Mr. Theron (Namibia): We, too, thank Mr.
Annabi for his comprehensive briefing today on the
activities of the United Nations Interim Administration
Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).
Naturally, my delegation naturally welcomes the
positive developments with regard to the work of
UNMIK since our last meeting. We are encouraged in
particular to hear that the preparations for the
municipal elections are proceeding well. We are aware
that the office of the Special Representative has opened
a line of communication with the authorities in
Belgrade, and in that regard we urge the Belgrade
authorities to encourage the minority communities in
Kosovo to participate in the forthcoming elections,
scheduled for 28 October.

While remaining concerned about the continuing
violence against minorities, my delegation is happy to
learn that the Mission has introduced a series of
initiatives geared towards the protection of minority
communities, as well as measures to address politically
motivated violence in Kosovo. However, the
deteriorating security situation in Mitrovica continues
to be of concern to my country.

My delegation appreciates the detailed
information given this morning about the takeover of
the smelter. We would, however, appreciate it if Mr.
Annabi could perhaps explain a bit about how the
closing would affect the employment rate in the
locality of the mine and whether that would perhaps
have an impact on the ongoing preparations for the
municipal elections.

In conclusion, we commend the men and women
of UNMIK for their dedication in assisting the people
of Kosovo to build a multi-ethnic society. My
delegation also looks forward to the report of the
Secretary-General to be issued next month on
UNMIK's activities.
