Ms. Honore: I would like to thank you, Sir, the
members of the Security Council, all Member States
and multilateral and regional organizations and
the Group of Friends for their observations and for
their continued support for the democratization and
stabilization process in Haiti. I also thank them for the
guidance they have provided for the work of the United
Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). I
have been particularly attentive to their expressions of
concern about the interruption in the electoral process
and to their recommendations on next steps. But even
more, I have been attentive to their remarks to all the
Haitian actors, on whose shoulders rests the primary
responsibility to move forward resolutely to overcome
the current impasse. On behalf ofthe men and women of
MINUSTAH - military, police, civilian, international
and national - as well as United Nations Volunteers,
I thank them all for their appreciation of our service.

The meeting rose at 7.30pm.
