The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of
Rwanda, in which he requests to be invited to participate in
the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
accordance with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the discussion without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Bakaramatsa
(Rwanda) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Assistance
Mission for Rwanda, document S/ 1996/ 149.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/l996/l77, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to the following other documents: S/ 1996/ 132,
letter dated 23 February 1996 from the Charge d'affaires ad
interim of the Permanent Mission of Zaire to the United
Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council;
and S/ 1996/ 176, letter dated 6 March 1996 from the
Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security
Council, transmitting the text of a letter dated 1 March
1996 from the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation
of Rwanda addressed to the Secretary-General.

The first speaker is the representative of Rwanda, on
whom I now call.
