The President: I thank the representative of
Australia for her kind words directed at my delegation
and at other members of the Council. As always, the
Council is pleased to hear the views of the larger
membership of the Organization in important issues
before it.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Norway. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
