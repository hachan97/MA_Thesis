Mr. Ndong Mba (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in Spanish): Equatorial Guinea has followed the
developments in the events related to the use of a
chemical agent in Salisbury on 4 March with concern.
We are carefully following the current investigations
aimed at full clarification of the incident. We expect
them to be exhaustive, fair and independent, and in
accordance with the relevant international norms.

Equatorial Guinea opposes the manufacture,
storage and use of chemical weapons, which contravene
the Chemical Weapons Convention and the purposes
and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and
advocates for their complete prohibition and destruction.
We hope that those responsible for their use, wherever
that may occur, will be brought to international justice.
We firmly condemn the attack on the lives of members
ofthe Skripal family in Salisbury. We stand in solidarity
with the British people, especially with the family of the
victims who died as a result of this abominable crime.

Equatorial Guinea reiterates its hope that the
parties concerned - the United Kingdom and the
Russian Federation - will display moderation and find
a way to manage the situation in an appropriate and
reasonable manner while maintaining direct contact
with one another.

The Republic of Equatorial Guinea reaffirms its
conviction that the complete and effective prohibition of
chemical weapons and their destruction is a necessary
step in realizing the purposes and principles of the
Charter, especially the maintenance of international
peace and security.
