Ms. Quiel Murcia (Panama) (spoke in Spanish):
The Republic of Panama is participating in this
emergency meeting of the Security Council to again
share its increasing concern about the seriousness
of the political, economic, social and humanitarian
situation that Venezuela is undergoing. As a result of
the search for a peaceful and democratic solution to the
crisis and the restoration of the democratic order, the
Government of the Republic of Panama has explicitly
recognized the President of the National Assembly,
Juan Guaido as the interim President of the Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela. Now that the legitimate term
of the Government of President Nicolas Maduro Moros
has concluded, Panama supports a peaceful democratic
transition that will lead to fair elections, with the equal
participation of all political actors. We also reject any
act of violence or repression that restricts the rights of
the Venezuelan people and the security of Venezuela
and, ultimately, our entire region.

Based on this vision, Panama has expressed strong
support for the measures adopted to seek international
humanitarian assistance and the release of political
prisoners. We also deeply regret the loss of human lives
while people were exercising their right to protest, and
we condemn acts of violence in all their manifestations,
regardless of who commits them.

Concern about the situation in Venezuela is genuine
and it cannot be interpreted as an interference into
its internal affairs, given the massive and continuous
exodus of Venezuelans who cross the border in search
of refuge in our countries. Official reports indicate, as
has been said in this Chamber, that this is the largest
migratory crisis of this type in the recent history
of Latin America. Many efforts have been made by
regional bodies prior to this meeting without success,
but we will continue to pursue these efforts with the
aim of finding a peaceful solution that benefits the
Venezuelan people.
