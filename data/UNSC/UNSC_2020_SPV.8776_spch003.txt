Ms. Evstigneeva (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian delegation voted in favour of resolution 2552 (2020), which extends by one year the mandate of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA). Russia has always supported the work of the Blue Helmets, who play a very important role in the overall security architecture of the country. We hope that MINUSCA will provide technical and logistical support to Bangui in conducting the general elections. We note the constructive approach of the penholders, which made it possible to reach consensus while maintaining in the text of the resolution a number of principal elements, including the reference to guiding principles on the provision of humanitarian assistance, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 46/182. We would like to stress in particular that the principle of respecting sovereignty and _ territorial integrity, as mentioned in the document, is an imperative in providing international humanitarian assistance, as is the fact that the country requiring assistance must play a primary role in initiating, organizing and coordinating assistance on its territory. We categorically reject any attempt to challenge or dilute the strength of these parameters of humanitarian assistance under any pretext, which we would consider to be an attempt to directly interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign State. We once again confirm Russia's commitment to the existing rules of humanitarian assistance and call on colleagues to follow our example.
