The President: As I give the floor to His Excellency
Mr. Mark Rutte, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of
the Netherlands, I want to express my apologies to
the other Prime Ministers and to my good friend His
Excellency Mr. Benkirane, the Head of Government
of Morocco, for the fact that I have been called to a
meeting on Syria. Ambassador Power sits as a member
of the President's Cabinet, and I am privileged to turn
the Chair over to her. We are extremely grateful for
everybody's participation and strong statements.

With pleasure, I now give the floor to His Excellency
Mr. Mark Rutte, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of the
Netherlands.
