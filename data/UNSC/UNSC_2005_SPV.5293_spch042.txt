The President: I am wondering whether, in the
light of the remarks that we have just heard and due to
the rather late hour, we can consider the debate closed.

Then I have to inform members of the Council
that the representatives of Cuba and Venezuela have
asked for the floor to make further statements. If I have
the consent of the members of the Council, I will
proceed accordingly. If there is no objection, I would
like, without further ado, to invite the representative of
Cuba to make an additional statement.
