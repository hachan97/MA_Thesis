Mr. Petrella (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): The
purpose of the draft resolution before the Council is to
effect an uninterrupted extension of arrangements under
resolution 986 (1995): the oil-for-food programme. I should
like to highlight the flexibility and common sense that
prevail in the consideration of this matter, and our belief
that any interruption in the programme would be
unacceptable because of the humanitarian consequences it
would entail.

Having said that, it is clear that over the next two
weeks we shall all have to work in a spirit of compromise
and flexibility to settle existing unresolved differences in
the ongoing negotiations on a substantive draft resolution.
We hope that we will very soon have before us the draft
resolution which has been in negotiation since the
beginning of this year on all aspects of the Iraq issue. We
believe that no effort should be spared to reach consensus
in the negotiations.
