The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Germany and Italy, in which they
request to be invited to participate in the discussion of
the item on the Council's agenda. In accordance with
the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the
Council, to invite those representatives to participate in
the discussion without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedures.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Kastrnp
(Germany) and Mr. Talo (Italy) took the seats
reserved for them at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, document
S/2000/529.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2000/591, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United
States of America.

I should like to draw the attention of the members
of the Council to document S/2000/586, letter dated 14
June 2000 from Portugal, transmitting the text of the
declaration of the Ministerial meeting of the Peace
Implementation Conference, held in Brussels on 23 and
24 May 2000.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I will first give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the
voting.
