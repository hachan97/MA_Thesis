Mr. Hannigan (Iceland): I would like to thank the
Chinese presidency for convening this meeting. I thank
you, Ambassador Liu, for your personal presence here
during the whole meeting.

Iwould also like to express ourthanks to Mr. Nickolay
Mladenov for his frank and informative assessment.

Iceland, like others, has been deeply concerned
by rising tensions related to events around Al-Haram
al-Sharif/Temple Mount, where violence has escalated
in recent days. We are encouraged by the decision of
the Israeli Government to remove metal detectors from
the Al-Aqsa area, hopefully defusing the situation.

Political leaders on both sides carry a heavy
responsibility to continue to reduce tensions, with
the assistance of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.
Religious leaders also have a significant role to play.
Confidence must be restored among Palestinians that
Israel is not attempting to alter the status quo, and the
Palestinian leadership must condemn all terrorist acts
and do its utmost to prevent violence.

Looking at the bigger picture, continued violent acts
committed by individual Palestinians against Israeli
citizens must cease, and Israeli settlements must come
to an end if the two-State solution is to remain viable.
The aim of resolution 2334 (2016), which implemented
several conclusions of the 2016 Quartet report, was
indeed to protect the two-State solution from further
erosion, particularly by Israeli settlements policy. The
regular reporting to the Security Council under the
resolution is an important injection of accountability.
A negotiated two-State solution is the only viable peace
plan that will provide a just and lasting peace and
allow both Israelis and Palestinians to live side by side
in peace.
