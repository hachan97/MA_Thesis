Ms. Coleman (United States of America): The
United States welcomes the adoption of resolution 2337
(2017). With the unanimous adoption of this resolution,
the Security Council stands united in calling for a
peaceful transition of power from one president to
another; endorses the mediation of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS);
and upholds the clear determination of ECOWAS
and the African Union that the will of the Gambian
people - clearly and peacefully expressed - must
be respected.

The patience and commitment to peace
demonstrated by Adama Barrow and the Gambian
people since December have been remarkable.
Gambian civil society organizations have refrained
from violent demonstrations; instead, they have made
their voices heard by issuing statements calling for a
peaceful transfer of power. The Gambian people have
placed their faith in ECOWAS and the international
community to safeguard the integrity of the election,
and we must not let them down.

We welcome the ECOWAS decisions from the
fiftieth ordinary summit, held 17 December 2016 in
Abuja. We applaud continued efforts by ECOWAS,
the African Union and the United Nations to broker a
peaceful transition, and call on all parties to exercise
restraint and to avoid bloodshed. It is important that
we support Adama Barrow, the democratic choice of
the Gambian people. We are eager to work closely with
Mr. Barrow and his team in order to help achieve the
aspirations of the Gambian people.
