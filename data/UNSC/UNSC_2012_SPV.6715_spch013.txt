Mr. Yang Tao (China) (spoke in Chinese): I wish
to thank Mr. Gilmore, Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of Ireland, for
his briefing on behalf of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).

The OSCE is an important organization for the
maintenance of international peace and security in
Europe. It is also a major partner of the United
Nations. We value the contributions of the OSCE to
preventive diplomacy, dispute settlement, post-conflict
peacebuilding and counter-terrorism in the Caucasus,
the Balkans and Central Asia. China has always
maintained that dialogue and consultations are the best
approach to resolving differences and to preventing
and settling conflicts. We encourage the OSCE to
continue its efforts in that regard.

China attaches great importance to cooperation
between the United Nations and regional and
subregional organizations in the maintenance of
international peace and security. The primary
responsibility for maintaining international peace and
security lies with the Security Council, but the
vigorous support of regional and subregional
organizations is indispensable. Both sides should make
full use of their comparative advantages and
complement each other in a common effort to promote
international peace and security.

Deputy Prime Minister Gilmore's briefing to the
Council today will help the Security Council and the
OSCE to enhance their communication and
coordination and to take their pragmatic and effective
cooperation in maintaining international peace and
security to a higher level. We encourage the OSCE to
continue to make full use of its comparative

advantages and to play a positive role in maintaining
regional peace, security and stability.
