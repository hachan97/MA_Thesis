Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
listened very attentively to the detailed and informative
briefing of Mr. Morris. It has been very helpful in
providing us with a better understanding of the food
situation in Africa. However, it must be acknowledged
that the picture he presented to us, in which 40 million
people lack food and face malnutrition, is very grave.
Without the strenuous efforts of Mr. Morris and his
colleagues, the situation today would be ever more
grim and terrifying.

We have a saying in China: if you give a fish to a
person, he or she can merely eat it as a meal. But if you
teach a person to fish, then he or she will benefit from
that for life and will live in comfort. Therefore, it is
obvious that, in addition to providing aid, a better
approach to eliminating poverty and the lack of food is
to teach people to fish.
I seek clarification about whether or not the WFP
works with other international organizations to increase
capacity for self-reliance, so that emergency aid can
produce better results.
