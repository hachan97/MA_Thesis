Mr. Gomersall (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom has worked hard, along with the other sponsors
of this resolution, to bring the Secretary-General's
proposal into effect through the proper procedure of a
Security Council resolution, and we are glad at the
consensus agreed on this text today. The support that this
resolution enjoys reflects our common wish to ensure that
the objectives of resolution 1153 (1998), which more than
doubled the humanitarian programme for the Iraqi people,
can be fulfilled.

My delegation would simply make three important
points. First, the resolution provides a basis for increased
volume and continuous operation of the humanitarian
programme for as long as the programme is needed;
secondly, it fulfils the wishes of the Secretary-General in
his letter dated 15 April 1998 for rapid approval of the
contracts necessary to upgrade Iraq's oil export capacity
to the necessary extent; and thirdly, the implementation of
the programme continues to require the full cooperation
of the Government of Iraq, and the consensus which we
strove to achieve on this text reflects the clear hope and
expectation of the Security Council that Iraq will indeed
cooperate fully with the Secretary-General in meeting the
objectives of the humanitarian programme as set out in
the resolutions of the Council.
