Sir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): The
United Kingdom welcomes this opportunity to discuss
the increasingly serious situation in the West Bank and
Gaza. We fully associate ourselves with the European
Union declaration, which Ambassador Levitte has just
quoted and which was agreed by European Union
foreign ministers on 20 November.

We urge both the Israeli Government and the
Palestinian Authority to implement the understandings
that were agreed at Sharm el-Sheikh and those that
were agreed subsequently, and to take immediate steps
to bring an end to the Violence. We condemn all
violence. It was a cowardly act to bomb the school bus
in Gaza on 20 November. But the kind of excessive
retaliatory action which we have seen in recent days
and weeks cannot be justified and cannot be in the
interest of peace and of the resumption of negotiations.
Violence followed by retaliation followed by more
violence, as we have seen in today's shameful bomb, is
a dead end. It leads nowhere.

We need to see an early return to diplomacy, and
we therefore welcome the first meeting of the fact-
finding committee, which will take place over the
coming weekend; we hope that the work of the
committee will proceed expeditiously. We also
welcome and support the efforts of the Secretary-
General and of others to find a mutually acceptable
basis on which to allow international observers into the
West Bank and Gaza. We continue to believe that
neutral observers, with the agreement and cooperation
of both parties, could play a constructive role in ending
the violence.

There was nothing in the statements we heard
from Palestine and Israel this afternoon to indicate that
the parties themselves will be able to bring violence to
an end without outside help.

The Security Council has an essential role to play
and should continue to keep the situation under close
observation.
