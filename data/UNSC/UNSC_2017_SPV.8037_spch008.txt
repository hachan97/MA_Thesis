Mr. Rosselli (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): My
delegation voted in favour of resolution 2373 (2017),
which we just adopted. As a troop-contributing
country to peacekeeping operations, Uruguay has
always endeavoured to ensure that missions are able to
discharge their mandates, achieve their objectives and
carry out the duties entrusted to them.

In our View, resolution 2373 (2017) further
strengthens the role of the United Nations Interim Force
in Lebanon (UNIFIL) by restoring its level ofinfluence
and boosting its capacity for action in the field. UNIFIL
has enormous responsibilities in an extremely sensitive
area, with a highly complex political landscape.
Consequently, UNIFIL must maintain an active and
visible presence in its area of operations so that it can
remain vigilant and ensure that it carries out its mission.

We fully agree with the remarks made by the
Ambassador of Italy on his views of the Security
Council's working methods.

The meeting rose at 3.55 p.m.
