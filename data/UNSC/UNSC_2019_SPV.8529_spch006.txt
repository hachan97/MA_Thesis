Ms. Wronecka (Poland): Like many of our
colleagues on the Council, we were surprised by the
Russian Federation's request for holding a meeting
today on Ukraine, as we strongly believe that Russia's
aggression against Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial
integrity is a direct threat to international peace and
security, while the fact that Ukraine's legitimate
authorities have signed a bill into law is not. Like other
Council members, Poland objects to having a discussion
of this subject in the Council today.
