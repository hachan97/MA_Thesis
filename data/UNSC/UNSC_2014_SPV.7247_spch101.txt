Mr. Aliyev (Azerbaijan): I would like to make a
further statement.

The statement made by the Armenian representative
earlier today was nothing but the standard Armenian
effort to mislead and to substitute notions, comparing
apples and oranges. That is especially true in the case
of conflict prevention and conflict resolution: although
they may be the same fruits, they are not the same
things. That is preposterous when one is speaking
about an unresolved conflict that started more than
20 years ago.

The Security Council witnessed today once again
another effort by the Armenian representative to distract
the general membership from the annexationist policy
of his country towards Azerbaijan and from the fact that
Armenia has occupied a large portion of Azerbaijani
territory and ethnically cleansed a large portion of the
Azerbaijani population. Armenians' unconstructive
approach to the negotiations, its interest in maintaining
the status quo, its evasion of the Madrid peace plan, its
refusal to comply with the relevant resolutions of the
Security Council, its policy of ruthless ethnic cleansing
and the latest provocative actions on the front line,
which are aimed at undermining the peace process,
all provide the strongest grounds for the international
community to impose substantial sanctions against
Armenia.

The continued presence of Armenia's armed forces
in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan remains the
biggest threat to the peace process. Therefore, first and
foremost, the armed forces of Armenia must withdraw
from the occupied territories of Azerbaijan. The earlier
Armenia realizes this, the sooner peace, stability and
predictability can be restored in the region.
