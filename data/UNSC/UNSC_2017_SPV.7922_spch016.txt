Mr. Seek (Senegal) (spoke in French): My delegation
would like to reiterate once more that nothing can
justify the atrocity that is the use of chemical weapons.
We are party to the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Senegal reiterates its condemnation of the use of
chemical weapons on 4 April in Khan Shaykhun in
Idlib province. That is why my delegation naturally
supported the draft resolution submitted today by the
United States, France and the United Kingdom, seeking
to uncover the truth about the attack on a transparent,
unbiased and impartial basis.

Members of the Security Council and the Secretary-
General requested the Organization for the Prohibition
of Chemical Weapons, through its Fact-finding Mission
in the Syrian Arab Republic, to pursue its efforts
to professionally pool and analyse the information
coming in in order to assign responsibility for the use
of chemical weapons and enable the Council to take
necessary measures. In addition to shedding light on
what happened on 4 April in the Idlib province, we
call for the spirit of consensus that prevailed when
we discussed resolutions 2118 (2013) and 2235 (2015),
which represent progress in the area of chemical
weapons in Syria. I would like to underscore the need
to find a political solution to the crisis on the basis

of the Geneva communique (S/2012/522, annex) and
resolution 2254 (2015), which can promote a positive

outcome to the crisis.
