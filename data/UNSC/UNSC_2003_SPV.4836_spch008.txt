Mr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese):
First of all, please allow me to congratulate you, Mr.
President, on your assumption of the presidency of the
Security Council for the month of October. China will
fully cooperate with you in order to carry out the
Council's work this month. I would also like to thank
Sir Emyr Jones Parry, the Permanent Representative of
the United Kingdom, for successfully presiding over
the work of the Council during September.

China is gravely concerned about the latest
developments in the Middle East situation. We strongly
condemn the suicide bombing of 4 October, which
resulted in many innocent civilian casualties. We
oppose any measures that may threaten the peace
process between Israel and Palestine. We strongly urge
both sides to cease acts of violence and any other acts
that may exacerbate tensions. We hope that they will
return to the proper track of settling disputes through
negotiation as soon as possible.

We also condemn Israel's air attack against Syria.
Israel's action is a violation of the norms of
international law. We are deeply concerned about the
negative effect of that action on the situation in the
Middle East. We call on all parties to exercise
maximum restraint in order to avoid any actions that
may lead to further aggravating tensions in the overall
situation in the Middle East.
