The President (spoke in Arabic): I shall now make
a statement in my national capacity.

I thank the delegation of the United States of
America for its efforts in the negotiations on resolution
2290 (2016), renewing the South Sudan sanctions
regime. I also thank the delegations that made positive
contributions to the negotiations and those whose
amendments improved the text of the resolution,
leading to its unanimous adoption. The negotiations
on resolution 2290 (2016) reflected the Council's
support for the Transitional Government of National
Unity, established in April; for the important efforts
of the African Union High Representative for South
Sudan, President Alpha Oumar Konare; and for their
hopes for the full implementation of the South Sudan
Peace Agreement.

I reiterate my delegation's position on the
importance of the international community's support
in general, and the Security Council's support in
particular, for the efforts of the Transitional Government
of National Unity to overcome the political, economic
and humanitarian challenges facing the country, and for
the full implementation the Peace Agreement. In that
context, I reiterate the importance of the meticulous
targeting and moderation of sanctions regime, given
that renewing and expanding sanctions is not the ideal
way at the moment to address the conflict, in which we
are seeing a rapprochement among the parties.

The Council must send positive messages to
encourage the initiatives in South Sudan in order to
maintain the positive momentum towards a resolution
of the conflict.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

I give the floor to the representative of South Sudan.
