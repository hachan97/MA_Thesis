The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Mark Malloch
Brown, Administrator of the United Nations
Development Programme.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Malloch Brown to take a seat at the
Council table.

The Council will now hear a briefing by
Mr. Malloch Brown, to whom I give the floor.
