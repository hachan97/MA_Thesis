The President (spoke in Spanish): Before we
adjourn, given that this is the last scheduled meeting of
the Council for this month, I would like to express the
sincere appreciation of the delegation of the Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela to the members of the Security
Council, especially my colleagues the permanent
representatives and their respective colleagues, as
well as to the Council's secretariat, for all the support
afforded to us. This has undoubtedly been a month of
great activity, during which we reached consensus on
several important issues before us. We would not have
been able to face everything we managed to address
alone or without the hard work, support and positive
contributions of every delegation and the staff of the
Secretariat, including conference servicing personnel.
Nor would the success achieved have been possible
without the professionalism of our team, for which I
thank them. Any failure is strictly my own.

As we conclude our presidency, I know I speak on
behalf of the entire Council in wishing good luck to the
delegation of Angola in the month of March. They have
our full support.

The meeting rose at 6.10 pm.
