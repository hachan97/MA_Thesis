The President: Ambassador Mahbubani's
analogy about the sprinkler system leads me to think
that perhaps we should not be thinking about people
coming along with buckets, but about building
replacement sprinkler systems. But this is something
that I hope that others will return to.

The next speaker on my list is the representative
of Morocco. I invite him to take a seat at the Council
table and to make his statement.
