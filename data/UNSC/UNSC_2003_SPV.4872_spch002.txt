Mr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We have joined the Security Council
consensus on the establishment of a new Committee
charged with drawing up a list of individuals and
entities pursuant to paragraphs 19 and 23 of resolution
1483 (2003). At the same time, we would like to note
that not all of our concerns were adequately addressed
in the resolution just adopted.

We have no concerns about the resolution in
principle, with regard to the need to continue the work
of drawing up a list of individuals and entities that fall
under paragraph 23 of resolution 1483 (2003).
However, we are convinced, due to the very unstable
situation in the area of ensuring security in Iraq, that it
is necessary to continue monitoring for any possible
violations of the bans on the delivery of weapons and
ammunition to that country. Those bans remain fully in
force under resolution 1483 (2003).

We do not understand why the authors of the
resolution just adopted refused, at this stage, to entrust
this new Committee with the function of monitoring
the arms embargo, particularly at a time when we
regularly hear statements on the illegal flow of arms
into Iraq.

The arms embargo was imposed by the Security
Council, which is responsible for ensuring appropriate
and transparent monitoring of compliance with the
embargo. If the new Committee is not entrusted with
monitoring for violations, any new violations will be
considered directly by the Security Council. We intend
to come back to the issue of giving this new Committee
monitoring authority, as provided for in paragraph 3 of
the resolution just adopted.
