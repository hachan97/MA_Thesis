Ms. Del Ponte: I, too, should like to express my
gratitude for the comments made, and, of course, I
deeply appreciate all the comments and suggestions
and will share them with my colleagues in my Office.

I will touch briefly on three issues.

First of all, I think it is clear from this morning's
discussions that there is unanimity in the Security
Council concerning full cooperation with the
International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia (ICTY). Let me say that full cooperation
will mean that Karadzic, Mladic and the other fugitives
will be at The Hague. I hope, therefore, that the
Security Council will follow up on cooperation with
us. As I said, Serbia, Montenegro and Croatia are on
the way to full cooperation with us.

Secondly, Djordjevic was arrested in Montenegro,
but that does not mean that he was not in Russia before
that. Following Tolimir's arrest, we acknowledged that
he was also in Russia in 2005. That is just to indicate
that they move around, but, in the end, they go back to
their country.

Concerning the transfer of cases to national
jurisdictions, I did not say that the Governments are
interfering; I said that the temptation of the respective
Governments to interfere in this process is still very
present. Why? To underline the importance of the
monitoring by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) of our trials,
particularly the 11 bis trials - because, of course, we
have primacy. It is important that such monitoring
continue in Croatia as well to avoid any possible
interference. But we do not yet have a real, concrete
case of this.
