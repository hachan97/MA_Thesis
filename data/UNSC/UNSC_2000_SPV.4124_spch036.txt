Mr. Jerandi (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): Allow me
once again to express our sincere thanks to you
personally, Sir, the Foreign Minister of Canada, and to all
the members of the Security Council, for the condolences
that they have expressed to the Government and the
people of Tunisia on the passing of Habib Bourguiba, the
first President of our Republic.
