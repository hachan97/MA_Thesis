The President (spoke in French): I thank the
representative of Senegal for the kind words addressed
to me.

Given the fact that we still have a large number of
speakers on our list, and in view of the hour * it is
6.05 pm. - I propose, with the Council's agreement,
to suspend our meeting until tomorrow morning at
10 am. sharp.

The meeting was suspended at 6.05 pm.
