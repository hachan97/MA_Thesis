Mr. Messone (Gabon) (spoke in French): Like
other delegations, Gabon wishes to express its deep
concerns regarding the alarming situation in Syria.
Gabon welcomes the lifting of the state of emergency
and other measures taken by the Syrian authorities.
However, we urge those authorities to put an
immediate end to the ongoing repression of peaceful
demonstrations and to investigate such human rights
violations.

My country stresses the need to respect
international humanitarian law in the face of the
deterioration of the humanitarian situation described by
Under-Secretary-General Pascoe. My delegation urges
the Government of Syria to take concrete measures for
deep-rooted reform to meet the aspirations of its
people. We also urge the authorities to ensure the
protection of civilians during law enforcement
operations.

Gabon, attached to inclusive political dialogue as
a bulwark of peace, urges the authorities in Syria to
establish recognized mechanisms that take into account
the legitimate aspirations of the people to lasting peace
and stability. That is why we welcome the upcoming
meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the
League of Arab States on 8 May.

Finally, we urge all regional actors to support
efforts to establish dialogue to put an end to the current
cycle of demonstrations and repression.
