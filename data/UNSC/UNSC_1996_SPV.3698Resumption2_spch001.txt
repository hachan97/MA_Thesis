The President (interpretation from French): Members
of the Council have before them document S/l996/803,
which contains the text of a draft resolution prepared in the
course of the Security Council's prior consultations.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless
I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution
contained in document S/ 1996/803 to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:

Botswana, Chile, China, Egypt, France, Germany,

Guinea-Bissau, Honduras, Indonesia, Italy, Poland,

Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, United

Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
Against:

None
Abstaining:

United States of America

The President (interpretation from French): The
result of the voting is as follows: 14 in favour, none
against and one abstention. The draft resolution has been

adopted as resolution 1073 (1996).

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 9:40 pm.
