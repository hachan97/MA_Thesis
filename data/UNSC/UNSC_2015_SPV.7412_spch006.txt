Mrs. Schwalger (New Zealand): We thank
Ambassador Oyarzun Marchesi for his briefing in his
capacity as Chair of the Security Council Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1737 (2006). New
Zealand fully supports the mandate of the Committee.

New Zealand joins others in acknowledging the
efforts of the P5+1 and Iran in their current negotiations
on a comprehensive agreement. New Zealand fully
supports that process and hopes that negotiations will
be concluded by the agreed deadline. We appreciate
the fact that the negotiations are sensitive for the key
parties involved, but we trust that those sensitivities
will not stand in the way of a comprehensive outcome.

New Zealand was encouraged by the briefing to
the Security Council provided several weeks ago by the
High Representative of the European Union, Federica
Mogherini, in which she noted that the parties had

"never been so close to what could be a turning
point in the history of Iran's relationship with the
West and with the region" (S/PV. 7402, p. 7).

New Zealand trusts that hope will be realized. For now,
however, it is important to remember that the existing
sanctions remain in place and that, as the 90-day report
notes, States have an obligation to duly implement
them.

New Zealand is aware of the challenges involved
in implementing complex sanctions regimes such as
the one set out in resolution 1737 (2006), particularly
for small States. At the conclusion of the P5+1 talks
with Iran, there will be a need for clear communication
with Member States on the implications for the
existing sanctions regime. We look forward to working
constructively as a member of the Committee to provide
guidance to Member States at the appropriate time.

Finally, we take the opportunity afforded by today's
briefing to encourage all parties involved in the talks to
sustain the commitment and the political will required
for a positive outcome.
