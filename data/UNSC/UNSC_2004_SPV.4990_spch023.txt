The President: There are still a number of
speakers remaining on my list for this morning. The
presidency is also aware of its responsibility to protect
Council members and others in the room from hunger.
With members' permission, I intend to suspend the
meeting until 3 pm.

The meeting was suspended at 1.20 pm.
