Mr. Allen (United Kingdom): I would like to start by aligning myself with the statement made by the representative of the United States. We welcome the unanimous adoption of resolution 2536 (2020), renewing the targeted sanctions and arms embargo aimed at curbing the armed groups that continue to perpetrate violence in the Central African Republic. Such unity on a 12-month renewal is particularly welcome as we approach elections in the Central African Republic later this year. We thank France for its efforts to achieve this outcome. We support the Government of the Central African Republic as it pursues security sector reform and the disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and repatriation process. We welcome the progress made so far in delivering on the benchmarks set by the Council in April 2019. Although we recognize and respect the desire of the Government of the Central African Republic to ease restrictions, we, like others, are concerned by the further easing of the arms embargo contained in the resolution. That risks contributing to the proliferation of rocket-propelled grenades within the Central African Republic and the wider region. We therefore encourage the Government of the Central African Republic to accelerate its efforts to meet the benchmarks and to take responsibility for ensuring effective storage and management of weapons and ammunition. The Council's consensus on returning to an annual cycle for the renewal of these measures provides the Government with a clear window in which real progress can be made. Such progress is vital to improving security for the people of the Central African Republic, combating the risk of armsproliferation and helping to ensure a peaceful, free and fair electoral process.
