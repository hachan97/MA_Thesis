Mr. Le Hoai Trung (Viet Nam): I wish to
acknowledge the participation of the Foreign Ministers
of Australia, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

I would now like to make a statement in my national
capacity that reflects the viewpoint of the Foreign
Ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), as stated on 19 July.

"ASEAN member States strongly condemn
the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-l7 in
eastern Ukraine on 17 July 2014. We express shock
at the tragic deaths of the 298 people of multiple
nationalities on board the airline.

"Flight MH-l7 was flying over non-restricted
airspace, and following a flight path which had been
declared safe by the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO). It is a flight route that is
utilized by many international airlines plying the
Asia-Europe route.

"ASEAN member States underline that it is
imperative that we find out precisely what happened
to Flight MH-l7. We call for a full, independent and
transparent investigation into the catastrophe. We
emphasize that investigations must not be hindered.

"ASEAN member States hereby convey our
profound sorrow and condolences to the families
and loved ones of those on board Flight MH-l7."
