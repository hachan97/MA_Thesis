President Johnson-Sirleaf: I just once again
would like to say thank you on behalf of the Liberian
people for the support we have received from all of the
nations represented at this table, from our neighbouring
countries and from our African brothers and sisters in
helping us make this transition from war to peace. I
thank all of those countries that have provided
peacekeeping troops and that have enabled us to reach
this point of progress. I thank the many of you around
this room, and the countries you represent, for
supporting our development effort that has enabled us
to embark upon these processes of change and
transformation. And I thank you for the kind
expression of continuing support that I have received
from all of you this morning.

I pledge to you, on behalf of the Liberian people,
that we will continue to take those measures that will
enable us to pursue peace, stability and development,
not only in Liberia, but also in our subregion and in
Africa.
