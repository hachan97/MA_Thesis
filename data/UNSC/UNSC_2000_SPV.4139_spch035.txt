Prince Zeid Bin Ra'ad (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic):
Mr. President, I would like to congratulate you on your
assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for
this month and on the wisdom and skill you have
demonstrated in conducting the affairs of the Council.

The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, under the
leadership of His Majesty King Abdullah II Bin Al-
Hussein, is committed to the full implementation of
Security Council resolutions 1270 (1999) and 1289 (2000).
While the situation in Sierra Leone remains critical, we
believe that the position of the United Nations will improve
in the near future. We are now in the process of reinforcing
the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL)
by committing two extra companies drawn from Jordan's
special forces, and we will be sending another battalion
within a few days.

We do not feel it is wise for the Council to consider
new initiatives while we are deploying our troops. A
reconsideration of the UNAMSIL mandate now may well
lead to an absence of agreement between the troop
contributors. In our opinion, this would weaken the
United Nations position in Sierra Leone. We believe the
present mandate should for the time being remain the way
it is, under Chapter VII of the Charter, until the situation
in Sierra Leone stabilizes. Here we support what was said
by the representative of India.

The Revolutionary United Front (RUF), under
Mr. Sankoh, must heed the condemnation of the Security
Council and the international community; Mr. Sankoh's
troops must not take further hostile action; rather, they
must abide by the terms of the Lome Agreement and
Security Council resolutions, and they must give up their
weapons immediately so the people of Sierra Leone can
have the peace they so richly deserve.

Finally, we would like to express our sincere
condolences to the families of those United Nations
personnel who lost their lives while fulfilling their duties.
