The President (spoke in Spanish): I would like to
inform Council members that, in view of the late hour,
and with their concurrence, I shall suspend the meeting
after we have heard the next speaker, who will be the
representative of Canada. We will resume the meeting
tomorrow, 27 February, at 6 pm.
I now invite the representative of Canada to take
a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
