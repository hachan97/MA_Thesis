Mr. Serksnys (Lithuania): Lithuania has
associated itself with the statement that was made on
behalf of the European Union yesterday.

Lithuania has always spoken out for the peaceful
resolution of conflicts. We regret the breakdown of the
diplomatic efforts of the Security Council, yet we have
also stood by the resolute opinion that no one shall be
allowed to flout Security Council resolutions. Saddam
Hussain's regime has been squandering the
international community's patience for 12 years.

Our hope is that the conflict will end swiftly and
that the loss of human life, suffering and destruction
will be minimal. Our Parliament decided last Tuesday
to offer medical and logistics personnel to the coalition
forces. These specialists will also be essential in
providing humanitarian relief to the Iraqi people.

Reconstructing and building a prosperous and
peaceful Iraq will be a challenging task. The
experience, capabilities and global reach of the United
Nations in the coordination of assistance in post-
conflict States can hardly be superseded. Lithuania is
ready to contribute to a humanitarian settlement in the
post-conflict period, closely coordinating its actions
with the appropriate international institutions.

Once again, I reiterate that we associate ourselves
with the European Union's position on this complex
issue.

In times of grave crisis, it is vital for the
international community to maintain unity and a sense
of common objectives. We must profit from the vast
United Nations potential. It is also important that the
United States and Europe work hand in hand to secure
the Vital Euro-Atlantic link, seeking solutions to
questions of strategic importance for all mankind.
