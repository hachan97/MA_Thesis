Mr. Gillerman (Israel): I believe that, before I
made my statement, the representatives of neither Iran
nor Syria were supposed to speak. I would just like
very, very briefly to express my appreciation - which
I hope is shared by members of the Security Council -
for the opportunity afforded to all of us to hear lectures
about terrorism by two of the world's greatest experts
on that subject.
