Mr. Granovsky (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Russia greatly values Eritrea and Ethiopia's
demonstration - in deeds, not words - of their
dedication to their commitments to peace. Evidence of
this is their steady compliance with the ceasefire
regime and their consistent implementation of the
Algiers Agreement.

We believe that the establishment of a Temporary
Security Zone (TSZ) is a qualitatively new stage in the
consolidation of the process of settling the conflict. We
pay due tribute to the political wisdom of the parties,
the efforts of the Secretary-General and the leadership
and command of the United Nations Mission in
Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE), which have led to this
important result.

The forward-moving process of stabilization in
the conflict zone reaffirms our consistent position
regarding the need for an early lifting of sanctions
against both States.

We fully support the measures taken by the
leadership of UNMEE within the framework of its
mandate to ensure an orderly return of refugees to the
borders of the Temporary Security Zone. This will
determine to a great extent the irreversibility of the
peace process. We emphasize the importance of having
the parties continue unswervingly to comply with their
commitments under international humanitarian law.

We consider it important for the international
community to continue to render adequate support to
the work of the Commission on the delimitation and
demarcation of the Eritrea-Ethiopia border. This
activity is of the greatest importance in order for the
peoples of these two countries to return definitively to
peaceful and constructive coexistence.
