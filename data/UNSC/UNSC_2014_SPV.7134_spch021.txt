Mr. Yatsenyuk (Ukraine): Mr. President, let
me thank you and the Council members for your
unconditional support of the territorial integrity,
sovereignty and independence of my country. This
is really great, and I will deliver the message to the
people of Ukraine that all, except one, supported the
independence and territorial integrity of my country.
We still believe that we can find a peaceful solution. My
Government is committed to executing all international
obligations. We adhere to all bilateral and multilateral
treaties that Ukraine has signed and ratified.

Crimea was, is and will be an integral part of
Ukraine. We will never recognize any kind ofmakeshift,
artificial and falsified so-called referendum. We are
ready to hold a nationwide dialogue in order to increase
the powers of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea in
the Ukrainian Parliament through constitutional means
and tools. We will protect and defend every minority in
my country. We stick to the principle of the Ukrainian
Constitution that says that, except for the Ukrainian
language, the only other language indicated in article
10 of the Ukrainian Constitution is the Russian one.
We will protect every religion of every one who is
a Ukrainian citizen. And we want to be very clear
in stating that this Government is ready for an open
dialogue.

We extended our hand to Russia, but in return
we got the barrel of a gun. But we still believe that
Russia is ready to negotiate and to tackle this dramatic
conflict - not only in our bilateral relations, but in the
whole of Europe - by peaceful means. What we are
asking for is the truth. History will judge us. We have
a chance to make history. We will do whatever we can
in order to preserve peace and stability and in order to
save my country.
