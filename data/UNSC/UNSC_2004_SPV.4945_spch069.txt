The President: There are no further speakers on
my list.
Before adjourning the meeting I would like to
thank all the speakers for their kind cooperation,
enabling the Security Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Most speakers remained within the
three-minute limit, and I am very grateful for that.

The Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 6.35 pm.
