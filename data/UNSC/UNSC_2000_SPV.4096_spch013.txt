The President: It is our highest hope that before we
adjourn this meeting we will be able to hear informal
responses from President Chiluba, Foreign Minister
Dlamini-Zuma and Foreign Minister Gurirab and have an
exchange of views under what I like to call "the Greenstock
rules". I would only point out that I have been wholly
unsuccessful this month in imposing the kind of discipline
in the Council that Ambassador Greenstock did last month.
I will leave it to the members to decide why he has greater
influence than I do over this process. But I do hope we will
be able to hear from President Chiluba and Foreign
Minister Dlamini-Zuma, in particular since I know both of
them are planning to leave the United States later today.

Members of the Council will now speak, beginning
with the representative of the People's Republic of China.
This will be truly his last appearance with us as China's
Permanent Representative. I know he said that before and
was asked to stay. We are very glad that he remained for
this important debate. We thank you for extending your
stay with us, Mr. Ambassador, over the last week when
you had other plans. We welcome you to hear your
statement and we once again wish you a very good
onward mission on behalf of your great country.
