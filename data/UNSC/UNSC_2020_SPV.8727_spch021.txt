Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I was mentioned in the Russian intervention so I would like to respond. I listen very carefully to what the Russian military say, including in briefings to the Council. I am waiting fora Russian military official to answer the question of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights: how can anyone justify carrying out such indiscriminate and inhumane attacks? But I also want to again record something that I have said here before. The Russian and Syrian military who violate international humanitarian law and bomb, or allow the bombing of, hospitals, medicalfacilities and civilians will one day be held personally accountable before the law for those actions. That is a very important point. They will not just be held collectively responsible. One day they will be held personally responsible. The other thing that I wanted to say concerning reconstruction is to support what the French representative said. As the United Kingdom, we have given some $2 billion to Syria in aid since the conflict began. The reconstruction of Syria will be made infinitely harder by the wanton destruction that the Syrian and Russian Governments are carrying out now. So it will be for Russian taxpayers, possibly assisted by Chinese taxpayers, but it will be for Russian taxpayers to put Syria back together again.
