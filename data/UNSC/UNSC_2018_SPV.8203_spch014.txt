Mr. Ma Zhaoxu (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
has noted the recent poisoning incident in the United
Kingdom.

We take note of the statements made by
relevant countries on this incident. We hope that a
comprehensive, objective and impartial investigation
can be conducted, based on the facts and in accordance
with the relevant international rules, and that it can reach

an evidence-based conclusion that can stand the test of
facts and history. We hope that the relevant parties can
handle the issue through the appropriate channels.
