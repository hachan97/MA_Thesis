Mr. Mufioz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): I, too,
should like to thank Mr. Lubbers for his briefing on the
serious humanitarian situation of refugees confronting
the international community. The briefing was an
important one.

As questions are to be asked at this time, I should
like to plunge into the heart of the matter and ask about
a refugee crisis that is currently under way. Mr.
Lubbers mentioned a number of such crises in his
briefing, but I wish to refer to that now unfolding in
the Sudan as a result of the conflict in Darfur. I should
like to ask several questions in this regard.

We know that there are thousands of refugees
moving from Darfur into Chad, as Mr. Lubbers
described in detail today. First, is there any information
on refugees potentially moving from Darfur into the
territory of the Central African Republic?

Secondly, what kind of security is being provided
by the Government of the Sudan for the Darfur camps?
What degree of control does the Government in
Khartoum have over the Janjaweed militia?

Thirdly, since the humanitarian ceasefire was
signed on 8 April, to what degree has the access of
humanitarian agencies to the most severely affected
zones improved? In this respect, how are visas and
travel permits being issued by the Government of the
Sudan to the various humanitarian agencies?

Fourthly, in the light of the information provided
by the press that the Janjaweed militias are assaulting
the camps in Chad, what security measures are being
provided by the Government of that country to those
camps? In this regard, has the United Nations provided
those camps with sufficient food? I have read criticism
in major newspapers to the effect that, when refugees
arrive in these camps, the United Nations has not
planned for enough food for the newcomers.

Fifthly, in view of the fact that the rainy season
will begin in just a few weeks, does Mr. Lubbers
believe that there is sufficient time to address an even
larger humanitarian crisis?
