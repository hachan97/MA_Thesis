Mr. Polyanskiy (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation voted in favour
of resolution 2469 (2019), extending the mandate of
the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei
(UNISFA). We note the stabilization of the situation
in Abyei, where intercommunal dialogue has been
established. We believe it is essential to maintain the
presence of peacekeepers in the region with a View to
ensuring security on the border between the Sudan and
South Sudan. We pay tribute to the efforts of the Blue
Helmets from Ethiopia.

However, we feel obliged to point out that the
text of the resolution fails to take many of Khartoum
and Juba's fundamental concerns into account, as the
unofficial penholders are well aware. For our part, we
supported the adoption of the resolution in consideration
of the fact that UNISFA is still one of the few
peacekeeping operations working with States that are
parties to a conflict. The Russian Federation hopes the
shortcomings Ijust mentioned will not have an impact
on the effectiveness of the Blue Helmets' fulfilment
of their mandate. We assume that the Secretariat will
be guided in its implementation by the fundamental
principles of peacekeeping that require the consent of
the parties involved. We hope that UNISFA's activities
will continue to help to build confidence between
Khartoum and Juba in the interests of achieving a final
settlement of Abyei's status as soon as possible.
