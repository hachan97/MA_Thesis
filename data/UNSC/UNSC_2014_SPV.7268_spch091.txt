The President: I thank Ms. Chan for her inspiring
comments, and I think she will be pleased to learn
that four additional countries have been added to the
sponsorship of today's resolution (2177 (2104)), which
will be reflected in the record.

I now give the floor to Dr. Nabarro to make some
concluding remarks.
