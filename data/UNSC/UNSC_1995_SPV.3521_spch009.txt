Mr. Inderfurth (United States of America): My
Government joins with the Council and with the
Government and people of France in expressing sorrow and
anger at the recent murder of two French soldiers serving
as peace-keepers in Bosnia. They died, as so many have
died in that tragic land, at the hands of cowardly snipers.
This resolution will not bring those brave soldiers back. But
it should serve to renew our resolve that the parties to the
conflict in Bosnia must respect the status of United Nations
personnel. It should prompt us to explore urgently the
means by which UNPROFOR personnel might better
defend themselves. And it should give new life to our
support for an extension to the Bosnian cease-fire and
cessation of hostilities that are due to expire at the end of
this month.

Finally, this resolution reminds us of the valour of the
thousands of men and women, of many nationalities, who
are now serving the cause of international security as
United Nations peace-keepers around the globe. Their tasks
are difficult, perilous and, too often, thankless. They
deserve the world's admiration and this Council's full
support.
