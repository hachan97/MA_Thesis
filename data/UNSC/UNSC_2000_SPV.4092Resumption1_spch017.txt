The President: This completes the ministerial
portion of today's important meeting.

The next speaker was supposed to be the United
States. I am waiving our turn.

We now begin the rotation of the Security Council
members.

Several speakers have already said that they would
like to remove themselves from the list of speakers.
Anyone who does so is welcome to send us a copy of the
text and, as President, I will distribute it immediately to
all other members of the Security Council. So I hope that
speakers' remarks will be as short as possible.
