Mr. Wlosowicz (Poland): It is with a great deal of
regret that we have had to meet today to consider yet
another draft resolution concerning Angola. We regret it
because we believe that this question should have already
been solved.

It must be admitted that the international community
committed itself to helping Angola out of its difficult
situation. Here the Security Council has played a most
prominent role. The question now is how much more we
can do, and the answer is not much, if the parties in
whose hands the fate of Angola rests are not ready to
commit themselves at least as much as the international
community. Many times in this Chamber we have
appealed to UNITA to fully and promptly implement the
provisions of the Lusaka Protocol. Many times we
believed the Lusaka Protocol would be implemented. But
as we see now, we were wrong. This situation cannot last
forever. So we call on UNITA yet again to rethink its
attitude and to start concrete cooperation. This is the only
possible route to restoring Angola's well-being.

Needless to say, we are not happy that the measures
specified in paragraph 4 of resolution 1127 (1997) will
come into force tonight. Yet we have supported them
because we believe that at this stage this is the only way
to force those to whom the measures are addressed to
take the efforts of the international community seriously.

Believing that the parties to the conflict will soon
resume effective cooperation, we support the extension of
the mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in
Angola (MON UA) until 30 January 1998. We are also of
the view that in the present circumstances it is wise to
postpone the withdrawal of the United Nations military
formed units from Angola.
