Mr. Seck (Senegal): Members of the Security
Council asked what, in your opinion, the Council
should do now when everyone agrees that the region
and the subregion, with the Intergovernmental
Authority on Development, the African Union and the
United Nations, which is the universal body, must align
their approach to help South Sudan get out of this very
difficult crisis. We asked our question with ourselves
in mind because we will be conducting consultations
in a few moments. As we are about to embark upon
consultations, the President thought that you might
have some thoughts pertaining to my question.
