Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation welcomes the
Council's adoption today of a draft resolution prepared
by my delegation on the Council's agreement to the
appointment of Ambassador Miroslav Lajcak as the
new High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
This decision is in keeping with the Dayton
Agreement, previous Council resolutions on Bosnia
and Herzegovina and previously reached agreements.
The very fact of the adoption of this resolution and its
content speaks for itself. We expect that the new High
Representative, Ambassador Lajeak, will continue with
the thoughtful and constructive approach taken by his
predecessor, Mr. Schwarz-Schilling, aimed at helping
the Bosnian parties to reach a compromise decision
through constructive dialogue. We believe that
Ambassador Lajeak will continue to work along those
lines, providing maximum assistance in the area of the
promotion of diplomatic mechanisms and local
initiatives and rejecting the practice of the unlimited
use of the Bonn powers.

I should like once again to express our gratitude
to Mr. Schwarz-Schilling for his work in the post of
High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
