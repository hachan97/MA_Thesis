Mr. Pankin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation was the initiator of
the first draft resolution on the extension of the
mandate of the United Nations Disengagement
Observer Force in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights
for another six months. We support the important
stabilizing role played by the Force, and we believe
that its presence in the area is necessary until there is
an end to tension in the area.

The Russian Federation, which voted in favour of
the draft resolution, wanted to continue the long-
standing practice by which members of the Council
unanimously express, in a presidential statement, their
support for the view of the Secretary-General that the
situation in the region is unstable and will remain so
until a comprehensive settlement is achieved that
covers all aspects of the Middle East problem. While
there was not unanimity in the Council on this, as there
were doubts in this regard, we are confident that this
important idea about the Middle East settlement was
reflected in the resolution adopted today.

We call on both sides to continue to cooperate
actively with United Nations personnel acting under
the Force's mandate and within the framework of
existing agreements to observe the ceasefire
agreement; to assist the United Nations Force in
carrying out its mission; and to ensure the security and
freedom of movement of its staff. We believe that the
capacities and resources of the United Nations Force
are sufficient for it to carry out its tasks.

In conclusion, I should like to emphasize that the
resolution just adopted, of which Russia was a
co-sponsor, is technical in nature and bears no relation
to developments in the political situation in Syria or in
Israel. Syria is not on the agenda of the Security
Council because it does not pose a threat to
international peace and security.
