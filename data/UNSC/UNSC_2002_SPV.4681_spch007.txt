Mr. De la Sabliere (France) (spoke in French):
France has lent its support to the draft resolution
presented by Syria on behalf of the Arab group. While
humanitarian personnel have paid a heavy price due to
disproportionate violence, it was indeed quite natural
for the Security Council to condemn the actions of
those who bear the responsibility for so doing.

It was both legitimate and justified as well for the
Security Council once again to engage Israel to respect
the obligations which devolve on it under international
humanitarian law, and in particular under the Fourth
Geneva Convention. We regret that the Council was not
in a position to adopt this draft resolution, which had a
limited but essential goal.
