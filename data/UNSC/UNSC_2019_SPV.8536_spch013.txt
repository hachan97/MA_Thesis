Mr. Albanai (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): Kuwait
voted in favour of resolution 2471 (2019), on extending
the sanctions regime as provided for in resolution
2206 (2015), although we would have liked to see its
unanimous adoption.

We call upon South Sudan to continue the
implementation of the Revitalized Agreement on
the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of
South Sudan and to expedite it. We also call upon
the signatory parties to work together so that the
pre-transitional process will be successful in leading to
the establishment of the Government of national unity.
We call as well upon non-signatory parties to sign the
Agreement as soon as possible.

It is necessary that the provisions of today's
resolution be implemented by all States, regardless of
any differences in their positions, as the resolution is
binding under the Charter of the United Nations. We
hope to arrive at a time when we will no longer need to
extend that sanctions regime, which is a means to reach
our objective of lasting peace in South Sudan.

In conclusion, I would like to sincerely congratulate
you, Mr. President, as well as your team and friendly
country, for conducting the work of the Council wisely
and with distinction during this month.
