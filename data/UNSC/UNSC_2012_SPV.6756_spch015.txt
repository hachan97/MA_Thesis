Mr. Menan (Togo) (spoke in French): Togo, like
the other members of the Security Council, welcomes
the adoption of resolution 2043 (2012), which reflects
the unity of action that has prevailed within the Council
since we adopted resolution 2042 (2012) a week ago.
By voting in favour of the resolution, Togo has
reaffirmed its firm support for Mr. Annan's mission as
well as for the efforts made by the Secretary-General
and all stakeholders striving for a swift return to peace
in Syria.

Togo remains convinced that the achievement of a
peaceful and prosperous Syria is first and foremost the
responsibility of the Syrians themselves - presidential
and opposition supporters alike. It is for that reason that
Togo calls on all Syrians, from whatever side, to strive
for a more effective implementation of the resolution
that the Council has just adopted.
