Ms. Sison (United States of America): I thank
Special Representative Kubis and Major Patrono for
their informative briefings this morning, as well as
for the important work that both the United Nations
Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) and the Italian
Carabinieri are doing in Iraq.

I would like to take this opportunity to briefly
highlight UNAMI's recently concluded independent
external assessment, Whose results we welcome. The
Council launched the pilot initiative in an effort to
shake up the United Nations approach to management
review and in support of the Secretary-General's
reform agenda. The study marks the first-ever external
assessment ofa special political mission's management
structures and resources with a View to ensuring that
they are being used effectively to optimize mandate
implementation.

This external third-party review, conducted by
expert consultants from outside the United Nations
system, provides excellent recommendations for
improving efficiency and accountability in the field so
as to enable the Council to make more informed strategic
decisions on UNAMI's mandate and strengthen the
Mission's ability to deliver on its mandate effectively.
The United States supports the work of the assessment
team and the creative solutions that it has put forward
to promote more effective coordination and burden-
sharing between the Mission and the United Nations
country team, enabling them to be more responsive
to Iraqis' needs. We hope the Secretary-General will
give careful consideration to the team's suggestions and
recommendations when he decides how best to address
UNAMI's management and resourcing challenges.
In a spirit of transparency regarding this Council-
mandated management product, the United States urges
the Secretary-General to share the full report with the
Council so as to illustrate the challenges that United
Nations field offices face in carrying out their critical
peacebuilding missions.
