Ms. Hidalgo (Dominican Republic) (spoke in Spanish): We welcome the adoption of resolution 2507 (2020). We understand that the adoption of this resolution reaffirms the Security Council's commitment to the authorities of the Central African Republic to contribute to their struggle to achieve sustainable peace. The Dominican Republic voted in favour of the resolution, recognizing the efforts of the authorities of the Central African Republic to implement the terms of reference and with a view to contributing to consensus in the Council. We hope that over the next six months, the authorities will continue to implement the steps established in presidential statement S/PRST/2019/3, of 9 April 2019, which will enable the Council to finally lift the sanctions regime and the arms embargo. We urge all parties to redouble their efforts to implement the February peace agreement and to continue working on the remaining challenges with a view to bringing about peace and lasting stability for their people.
