The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno, Under-
Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Guehenno to take a seat at the
Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Guehenno on the situation between
Eritrea and Ethiopia. Accordingly, there is no list of
speakers. I shall call speakers as they apply to the
President or the Secretariat in the normal way of our
informal consultations in open chamber. If speakers
raise questions, I might turn to Mr. Guehenno to
answer those questions as they come up.

I give the floor to Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno,
Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations.
