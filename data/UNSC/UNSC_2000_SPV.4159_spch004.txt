The President (interpretation from French): I
thank Ambassador Ben Mustapha, Permanent
Representative of Tunisia, for his announcement. His
statement is clear testimony to the commitment of the
international community in favour of a peace
settlement that is in conformity with the Lusaka
Agreement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/2000/587) before it. Unless I hear any objection, I
shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by Show ofhands.
In favour:

Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, China, France,

Jamaica, Malaysia, Mali, Namibia, Netherlands,

Russian Federation, Tunisia, Ukraine, United

Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,

United States of America

The President (interpretation from French):
There were 15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has
been adopted unanimously as resolution 1304 (2000).

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

Before adjourning the meeting, I would like to
underscore the symbolic value - I think it is the first
time this has happened in the history of the United
Nations of your presence here at the Security Council
table at the time of the adoption of a resolution. This
symbol seals our partnership. We are by your side for
the implementation of the Lusaka Agreement, but for
that we first need the will - your will. On your way
back to Africa, to your countries, take with you our
thoughts and think of three words: peace, peace, peace.

The meeting rose at 8p.rn.
