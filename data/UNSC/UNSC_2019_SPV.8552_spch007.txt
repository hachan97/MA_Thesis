The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank Major
General Pearce for her briefing.

I remind all colleagues that the concept for this
briefing aims to keep it as interactive as possible - the
mainaddedvaluebeingthequestion-and-answersegment
with the Force Commanders. Therefore, so as to take
advantage of this opportunity and hear more from
our guests, I encourage Council members to keep
their statements brief and focus on the question-and-
answer segment.

I shall now give the floor to those Council members
who wish to make statements.
