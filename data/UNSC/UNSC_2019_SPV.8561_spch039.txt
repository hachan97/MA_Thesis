Mr. Safronkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I would just like to correct my British
colleague. All the answers to her questions are
contained in Major General Bakin's statement. She
simply needs to read and listen to it again thoroughly. It
contains exhaustive answers, including with regard to
humanitarian matters.

The meeting rose at 5.15 pm.
