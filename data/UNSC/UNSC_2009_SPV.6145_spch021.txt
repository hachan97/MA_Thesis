Mr. Al Bayati (Iraq): I have no comment other
than to thank you, Sir, for having taken the trouble to
travel to New York again during such a short period to
preside over this meeting.

I should like to express my thanks and gratitude,
as well as the thanks of the Iraqi Government and
people, to Mr. Staffan de Mistura. We will miss him.
He has done a commendable job in helping Iraq and
the Iraqi people. I hope that the United Nations will
continue to help Iraq and its people in their affairs,
working towards a democratic, pluralistic and stable
Iraq.
