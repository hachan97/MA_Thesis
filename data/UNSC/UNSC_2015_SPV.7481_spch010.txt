Mr. Wilson (United Kingdom): The draft resolution
(S/2015/508) before us is a balanced text. We have
worked very hard to make sure that it is so and that it
remembers the past respectfully and sensitively. Let me
be clear: there were victims on all sides. That is clearly
set out in the text. Crimes were committed against all
sides and by all sides. Again, that is clear in the text.

This draft resolution does not accuse the Serb
people; instead, it supports reconciliation. Recognition
of the past is a prerequisite for that. It also calls on the
United Nations and all of us to learn the lessons and act
on the painful lessons from the genocide at Srebrenica.

All Council members know how hard we have
worked to find a consensus on the text. We have been
working on this for over a month. We delayed the vote
from yesterday until today to make that possibility have
best chance of success. We thank all members for their
support and patience while we did that.

Members of the Council will also know that an
unbridgeable gap lies at the heart or our respective
differences. The horrific events at Srebrenica amounted
to a genocide. That is not a verdict that the Security
Council is seeking to establish, but a verdict that is
clearly set out in judgments from the International
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the
International Court of Justice. To call it anything else
now will hinder, and not help, reconciliation. That is
why many voices from the region are calling for us to
proceed and to vote, and thereby honouring the victims
as we do so. For that reason, I think it is vital now that
we proceed to a vote.
