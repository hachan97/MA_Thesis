Mr. Hoang Chi Trung (Viet Nam): First of all,
Sir, my delegation would like to congratulate you and
the United States of America on your assumption of the
presidency of the Council for this month. We are
convinced that under your stewardship the Council will
accomplish its duties in an efficient manner.

We wish also to express our deep appreciation to
the United Kingdom for its service to the Council last
month as it assumed the Council presidency.

Viet Nam shares the concern of the international
community over acts of piracy and armed robbery
against vessels in the waters off the coast of Somalia,
which pose a great threat to international navigation
and the delivery of humanitarian aid to Somalia. My
country is fully committed to fighting against piracy at
sea and always supports international cooperation on
anti-piracy in conformity with the provisions of
international law and the 1982 United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The
resolution drawn up and adopted at the request of and
with the consent of the Transitional Federal
Government of Somalia provides for cooperative
activities to combat piracy and armed robbery in the
waters adjacent to Somalia under the conditions
sanctioned by UNCLOS.

For those reasons, Viet Nam voted in favour of
the resolution and wishes to reaffirm that the resolution
shall not be interpreted as allowing any action that is
contrary to international law, the Charter and the 1982
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to be
taken within the maritime areas under the jurisdiction
of a coastal State.
