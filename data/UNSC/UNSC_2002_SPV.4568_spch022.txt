Mr. Gatilov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): First, Mr. President, let me express my
gratitude to you for having organized today's meeting
of the Security Council on a question which has
recently become a matter of constant tension among an
overwhelming majority of States Members of the
United Nations. The value of this meeting is in
enabling us to better understand the approaches to this
matter adopted by various States. Questions of legal
status and additional safeguards accorded to
peacekeepers in the context of the jurisdiction of the
International Criminal Court (ICC) are multi-faceted
issues with no easy solution. Here we are discussing
one of the key tasks of the United Nations, namely, the
unimpeded timely conduct of peacekeeping operations
whose success is often decisive for the lives of many
thousands of people as well for security and stability in
conflict areas.
We understand the concerns of the United States
about this. We also understand the position of those
who defend the spirit and the letter of the Rome
Statute, one of the most authoritative international
treaties of our time, whose parties now number more
than 75 States, a number that most likely will continue
to grow.

We hope a solution will be found to this issue
which will not imperil United Nations peacekeeping
operations, and which at the same time will remain
within the confines of the law and will not diminish the
Statute of the Court, which has entered into force. It is
not just a matter of taking into account the interests of
the significant segment of the world community that
supports the ICC; the point is not to damage one of the
major spheres of activity of the Security Council:
peacekeeping.

We commend the willingness demonstrated by the
United States to try to find a solution on the basis of
the provisions of the Rome Statute. For our part, we
will remain in close contact with all interested parties
to try to find a mutually acceptable solution.
