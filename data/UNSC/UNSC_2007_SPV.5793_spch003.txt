The President: I thank the Permanent
Representative of Norway, Mr. Johan Lovald, for the
briefing he delivered in his capacity as Chair of the
country-specific meetings on Burundi in the
Peacebuilding Commission. I am certain that I speak
on behalf of all the members of the Council in thanking
him. What he has told us confirms that the
Peacebuilding Commission's current actions, and its
interaction with the Security Council and, of course,
with the General Assembly, make a difference.

On behalf of the members of the Council, I also
wish to express appreciation for Mr. Lovald's point that
the Commission is ready to move from the
identification phase to the implementation phase. I
think that that is a crucial point.

There being no further speakers inscribed on my
list, and in accordance with the understanding reached
in the Council's prior consultations, I should now like
to invite Council members to informal consultations to
continue our discussions on this subject.

The meeting rose at 3.30 p.m.
