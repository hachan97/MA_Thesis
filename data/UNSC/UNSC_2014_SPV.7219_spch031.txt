Mr. Rischynski (Canada) (spoke in French): I
thank you, Mr. President, for this opportunity to take
the floor, although this is a day of such great sadness
for the entire international community.

(spoke in English)

Canadians are shocked and saddened by the terrible
loss of life in the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines
Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine. With evidence mounting
that the airliner was brought down by a surface-to-
air missile, we are increasingly convinced that this
is not only a tragedy but also very likely the result of
an outrageous crime, perpetrated against hundreds of
innocent civilians of many nationalities.

Canada calls on all the parties to the conflict in
Ukraine to cooperate fully with an international
investigation into the incident. Both Ukrainian
authorities and international experts must be permitted
full and secure access to the crash site, and must be
provided access to all the relevant data and evidence
pertaining to the downing of the aircraft. We
commend the Government of Ukraine for launching
an investigation, and we thank the people of Ukraine
for their sincere expressions of condolence to all those
affected by this tragedy, including Canada. Canada
stands ready to provide whatever support it can to assist
authorities in determining the cause of the crash.

Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was brought down in
a region of Ukraine embroiled in armed conflict. This
is a conflict generated and perpetuated by Russia's
provocative military actions against the sovereignty,
territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine. We
once again call on Russia to cease its political, financial
and material support to armed insurgents in eastern
Ukraine. Following the loss of so many lives aboard
Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, the grave international
consequences of Russian-sponsored violence in eastern
Ukraine are now plain for all to see.
