The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received letters from the representatives of the
Central African Republic and the Sudan, in which they
request to be invited to participate in the discussion of the
item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the discussion,
without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Deinde-
Fernandez (Central African Republic) took a seat at
the Council table; Mr. Erwa (Sudan) took the seat
reserved for him at the side of the Council Chamber.

The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General pursuant to resolution 1152 (1998)
concerning the situation in the Central African Republic,
documents S/1998/148 and addendum 1. Members of the
Council also have before them document S/1998/268, which
contains the text of a draft resolution prepared in the course
of the Council's prior consultations.

The first speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of the Central African Republic, on whom I
now call.
