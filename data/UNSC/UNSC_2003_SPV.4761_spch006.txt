Mr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): I believe
that this is a very important day for the people of Iraq
as well as for the United Nations. The Security
Council, as a whole, has understood that the time to be
realistic has now come. Some may say that this
resolution is not perfect, but no one can deny that it
provides an appropriate legal framework for dealing
with the special, anomalous and grave situation facing
the international community.

I believe, therefore, that we have adopted an
important, indispensable and relevant resolution. I can
say this because, leaving aside the recent past, it sets
out some fundamental principles: first, that of the
sovereignty and integrity of Iraq; secondly, the
principle that the Iraqis alone are the owners of their
political future and their economic resources; thirdly,
guidelines for the conduct of the authorities that will be
managing this transitional period in Iraq - and
transparency in economic affairs is not the least
relevant of these guidelines; and, fourthly, it provides
an important and independent role for the United
Nations.

I very much hope that today, in addition to being
a significant day, will be a day of hope, primarily for
the people of Iraq. We wish them in the immediate
future peace, stability and the fullest freedom. But we
hope also that for the United Nations, having overcome
the mood of recent days, today's consensus will augur
well with respect to the many challenges facing the
world and the Council today - African issues,
terrorism, the situation in the Middle East, and so on.
