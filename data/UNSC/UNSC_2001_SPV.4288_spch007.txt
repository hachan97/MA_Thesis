The President: I would like to thank the
representative of Sweden for his statement on behalf of
the European Union. He has very pertinently reminded
the Council of the major focus of the Security Council
summit, namely, the need to pay special attention to the
promotion of durable peace and security in Africa.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Japan. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
