Mr. Kyslytsya (Ukraine): I would like to make
some short comments about the statement made earlier
by the delegation of the Russian Federation.

For almost two years now, the delegation of
the aggressor country has been desperately trying
to convince all of us in the Chamber that Russia is
not a part of a conflict in Ukraine. We have already
witnessed such an approach with regard to the occupied
part of Ukraine - the Autonomous Republic of
Crimea. I am quite sure that we all remember when the
same permanent member of the Security Council by all
means denied the presence of the Russian armed forces
in Crimea. Afterward, we heard the confession of the
Russian President about the direct role of the Russian
armed forces in the occupation of part of sovereign
Ukrainian territory. On 17 December 2015, Mr. Putin
acknowledged the presence of the Russian servicemen
in Donbas. Following is a quote from the Russian
President's website.

(spoke in Russian)

"We never said that there were no people who were
resolving certain issues, including in the miltary
sphere."

(spoke in English)

Once again, I emphasize our firm commitment
to the full implementation of all the provisions of the
Minsk agreements by all parties without exception. Our
key goal in 2016 is clear: to bring peace back to Ukraine
and justice back to the international order. We believe
that there is no alternative to a political solution. Our
formula for a peaceful settlement is simple, that is,
the withdrawal of all Russian troops from Ukraine's
territory, the holding of local elections in Donbas in
accordance with Ukrainian legislation and standards
set by the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe and the reinstatement of the Ukraine's full
control over the border with Russia.
