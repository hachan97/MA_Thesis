The President: I thank Ambassador Arias for his
kind words addressed to me and to all of us.
The Security Council is holding an important
debate today. We are all aware of the recent surge in
demand for United Nations peacekeeping operations in
different parts of the world. It is indeed welcome news
that the United Nations is being increasingly called
upon to do what has been its raison d'etre, that is, to
keep the peace.

At the same time, ensuring an effective response
entails formidable challenges for the United Nations
system. Pakistan believes it is both timely and
appropriate to highlight the forthcoming challenges in
peacekeeping and to help generate sufficient levels of
political, financial, human and logistical support for
Member States required in establishing new missions.
It is equally important to evaluate the progress made in
United Nations peacekeeping over the past few years,
analyse future trends and consider ways of meeting the
challenges and the strategic, operational and other
aspects of peacekeeping operations.

It is in that perspective that Pakistan proposed
today's debate. We hope that we will have a fruitful
exchange of Views that will help us all promote our
shared objectives of better preparation for the coming
challenges and for utilizing more effectively the
instrument of United Nations peacekeeping in the
furtherance of international peace and security.

I welcome the presence of the Secretary-General,
His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, and invite him to take
the floor.
