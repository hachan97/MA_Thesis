Mr. Dejammet (France) (interpretation from French):
The French delegation will support the draft resolution we
are about to vote on, which will establish the United
Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA). The draft
is explicit regarding recent developments in the situation in
Angola and the goal of the new Mission. For that reason,
the French delegation will limit itself to a few observations.

The formation last April of a Government of
national unity and the integration within the Parliament of
the UNITA deputies marked a decisive turning point on
the path of reconciliation. UN ITA has begun to participate
in political life in a consistent and peaceful manner.

Not surprisingly, the events in the former Zaire have
had repercussions in Angola. A shock wave has once
again swept the Angolan parties onto the path of
confrontation. This confrontation, however, could have
been even more serious. Up to now, escalation has been
avoided. This can be explained by the fact that important
stages had been previously completed on the path towards
reconciliation.

Recent tensions, however, have shown that the
provisions of the Lusaka Protocol were still being flouted,
primarily by UNITA, and that, for example, it still retains
significant military strength. UNITA must abide by its
obligations and understand that only participation in
political life can provide it with prospects for the future.
The Angolan Government will facilitate the harmonious
development of the situation by adopting an attitude of
restraint and strict respect for the Lusaka Protocol. The
Government of Angola can count on the determination of
the French authorities to assist it in its work of rebuilding
a reconciled Angola.

In conclusion, I should like to pay tribute to the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Maitre
Beye, whose energy, determination and diplomatic skill
have greatly contributed to the progress of the Angolan
peace process.
