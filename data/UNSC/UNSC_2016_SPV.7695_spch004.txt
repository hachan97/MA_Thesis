Mr. Vitrenko (Ukraine): As a sponsor of today's
resolution 2288 (2016), Ukraine took into account the
fact that it is a logical and much-desired outcome ofthe
dedicated efforts of the Security Council, the United
Nations and the international community to restore
peace and stability in Liberia. Less than a month ago,
we took a similar step in completely lifting the C6te
d'Ivoire sanctions regime. Both those countries have
travelled a long, hard road to arrive at that juncture.
We heartily commend Liberians and Ivorians for their
perseverance and genuine commitment to peace, which
made our adoption of resolutions 2283 (2016) and 2288
(2016) possible.

We also want to give due credit to the two countries'
international partners for helping them to meet the
criteria required for the cancellation of sanctions.
But there is still a long way to go before sustainable
peace and stability are achieved in West Africa, with
numerous challenges facing its countries. In order for
Liberia to address them, we look forward particularly
to seeing it adopt and implement appropriate legislation
for managing arms and ammunition, as well as the
country's completion of the weapons-marking process.
Potential threats of terrorism must be dealt with with
an emphasis on the regional context, which is why the
Council should remain vigilant and keep a watchful eye
on Liberia.

Ukraine is proud to have contributed to the
stabilization of Liberia, both through its active
participation in the United Nations peacekeeping and
peacebuilding efforts and as Chair of the Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1521 (2003). That
Committee has now just become history. On behalf of
its Chair, I would like to thank all the members of the
Committee, the Secretariat and the Panel of Experts for
their assistance.
