The President: I will now make a very short
additional statement in my national capacity.

I wanted to say again that the late James Le
Mesurier was not a serving British officer. He did begin
his career in the British military; my Military Adviser
here served with him. He then left the armed forces,
became a humanitarian and founded Mayday Rescue
and the White Helmets. I want that to be on the record.

The second thing I wanted to do was address the
Syrian Ambassador's point that if you have a cross-
border resolution, that somehow contravenes Syrian
sovereignty and territorial integrity. It does not. We
have the resolution precisely because of sovereignty
and territorial integrity. In other words, we need
authorization. I did not want a misimpression to gain
currency there.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

There are no more names inscribed on the list
of speakers.

The meeting rose at 4.55 pm.
