The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the
Secretary-General for his statement, for his vision, for
his views and for the challenges he has presented to us
for our consideration this morning.

Before proceeding, I should like to welcome the
presence among us in the Chamber of a delegation of
Senators from the Mexican Congress. With us are
Senator Silvia Hernandez of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, Senator Eduardo Ovando of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party and Senator Fernando
Margain of the National Action Party.

I now call on His Excellency Mr. Ian Kavan,
President of the General Assembly.
