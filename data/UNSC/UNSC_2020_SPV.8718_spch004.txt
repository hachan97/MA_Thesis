Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian delegation voted in favour of resolution 2508 (2020), on extending the mandate of the Panel of Experts of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1591 (2005), concerning the Sudan. As we see it, the situation in Darfur is steadily normalizing. We note the generally positive dynamics in the military and political situation and the peaceful settlement of the conflict in that Sudanese region. It is clear that the positive trends attest to the fact that the 15-year-old sanctions have now fulfilled their purpose. This document enshrines the understanding that the time has come to develop a clear road map on the review of Security Council restrictions and the eventual lifting of sanctions against the Sudan. Eritrea's experience shows that, with the appropriate political will, it is possible to make significant strides towards the lifting of sanctions. We hope that our colleagues in the Council will find the courage to take that important and necessary step forward. We would like to highlight Khartoum's mediation efforts with respect to the Central African and the South Sudanese negotiation tracks. Such steps to stabilize the entire subregion should certainly be duly noted by the international community, first and foremost by the Security Council, which bears the primary responsibility for maintaining peace and security. In conclusion, we would like to once again underscore that any Security Council sanctions regime should be subject to review and adapted to the realities on the ground. We hope that the specific parameters for the lifting of sanctions on the Sudan will soon be in place, because it is high time for that.
