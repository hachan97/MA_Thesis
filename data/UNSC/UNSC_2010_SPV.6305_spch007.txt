Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): Mexico
joined the consensus on resolution 1920 (2010), which
we have just adopted, thus expressing our support to
the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in
Western Sahara (MINURSO) and the steps taken by the
Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General to find a final
solution to the question of Western Sahara.

Nonetheless, we would have preferred a more
balanced and direct text that would have addressed
every issue and not avoided matters that are central to
the situation in Western Sahara or set aside essential
principles of international law. Respect for the self-
determination of peoples and the question of human
rights, which are at the core of the situation, deserved
to be addressed in greater depth and more directly, as
in Security Council resolutions in general.

We must also learn from the process of
negotiating this resolution. The negotiations on
Western Sahara are not and can no longer be the
monopoly of any group of countries. They must be the
collective responsibility of all Council members.
Indeed, today we were able to reach this consensus
with the participation and proposals of all delegations.
This should be a lesson for the future.
