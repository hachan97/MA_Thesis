Mr. Mohammad (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I
would like to thank the delegations of the Russian
Federation and the United States of America for
submitting the draft of today's resolution. We voted
in favour of resolution 2503 (2019), which extends
the mandate of the United Nations Disengagement
Observer Force (UNDOF) for an additional six months,
because we are convinced that it contributes to stability
and security in the region. In that context, we welcome
all the efforts made by UNDOF and the professionalism
of its troops, who work under extremely sensitive and
difficult conditions - especially given the presence of
mines and improvised explosive devices.

We reiterate that the Golan is Syrian territory
occupied by Israel, the occupying Power. We reject the
seizing of territory by force, which is in contravention
of Charter of the United Nations, principles of
international law and the relevant resolutions of the
Security Council, including resolution 497 (1981),
which was unanimously adopted. Israel, the occupying
Power, decided to impose its laws, authority and
administration over the occupied Golan - a step that is
null and void and does not have any legal impact. Given
that the Security Council stresses the need to address
root causes of the conflict, we reiterate that Israel's
occupation of Arab territories, including occupied
Syrian Arab Golan, is the root cause of this conflict
and represents a constant threat to peace and security
in the region.

The solution to achieving stability in the region does
not lie in preserving the status quo and perpetuating
the occupation, but rather starts with Israel's complete
withdrawal from occupied Arab territory and the
implementation of the relevant resolutions of the
Council, in particular resolutions 497 (1981), 338 (1973)
and 242 (1967).
