The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them document
S/2019/89, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2019/37, which contains the report of
the Secretary-General on the United Nations operation
in Cyprus.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.

I should like to inform the Council that
the presidency of the Council has met with the
representatives of the parties, who have confirmed that
they maintain their well-known positions vis-a-vis the
item on the Council's agenda. On the basis of those
meetings, with the consent of the members of the
Council, the presidency has drawn the conclusion that
the Council can proceed to take a decision on the draft
resolution before it.

IfI hear no objection, I shall put the draft resolution
to the vote now.

A vote was taken by show ofhands.

In favour:
Belgium, China, Cote d'Ivoire, Dominican
Republic, Equatorial Guinea, France, Germany,
Indonesia, Kuwait, Peru, Poland, Russian
Federation, South Africa, United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States
of America

The President (spoke in Spanish): The draft
resolution received 15 votes in favour. The draft
resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 2453 (2019).

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements.
