Mr. Sulunteh (Liberia): When last we were
honoured with the opportunity to intervene in the
Council (see S/PV.7824), we put before those present
the concerns of our Government and people. Today
we will not bore the members of the Council with a
repetition of those concerns. What we want to do today
is to thank everyone - those that voted in favour of
resolution 2333 (2016) as well as those that abstained.

We note all of the concerns that have been
expressed here, but we also recognize that the action
we have taken today on behalf of Liberia will go a
long way towards consolidating the gains we have
already made. For us, that signals that the Security
Council continues to demonstrate a willingness not just
to punish wrongdoing, but to reward success and the
actions of countries emerging from conflict that are
determined to do the right thing by themselves and with
the international community.

Thus, on behalf of a grateful nation and a grateful
Government, we look forward to the continued
engagement of this Council and to working with the
United Nations Mission in Liberia over the course of
the coming year and to bringing that mission to an end,
as we promised, in one year.

The meeting rose at 11.15 am.
