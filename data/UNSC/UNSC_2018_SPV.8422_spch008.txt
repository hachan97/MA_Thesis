Mr. Ma Zhaoxu (China) (spoke in Chinese):
The United Nations Multidimensional Integrated
Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic
has played an important role in maintaining peace and
stability in the Central African Republic, and China
supports the extension of its mandate. Meanwhile, the
efforts of the relevant parties within the international
community to achieve peace and security in the Central
African Republic should be recognized and positively
acknowledged. The legitimate concerns of all parties,
particularly the Central African Republic, should be
fully heeded and taken seriously by the penholders.
Resolution 2448 (2018) should serve to foster Council
consensus, maintain Council unity and send a positive
signal from the international community in support
of the Government of the Central African Republic.
Only in doing so can we contribute to lasting peace
and stability in the Central African Republic. With
that in mind, China abstained in the voting on the draft
resolution just adopted.
