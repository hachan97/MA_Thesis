The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like to
make only a brief comment in my national capacity,
since Spain's position was clearly reflected in the
statement made by the representative of Angola. At the
end of this meeting, I shall, in my national capacity,
deliver a brief summary of today's debate, to be
circulated to all delegations.

Resuming my functions as President of the Security
Council, I thank representatives for keeping their
statements brief. The concept note before the Council
(S/2015/793, annex) up to ten minutes are alloted to
joint statements by groups, three minutes to national
statements, and only two minutes to national statements
complementing joint statements. Some delegations
have told me that two minutes is very little time, but ifa
delegation has already been represented in a statement
delivered on behalf of a group, then two minutes should
be sufficient. I believe that in that respect our working
methods should evolve, because when the Organization
was created it had 51 Member States, and now we are
193. We will have to organize ourselves in a different,
more innovative way in order to become more effective.

I should like to ask that representatives speak at
a normal speed so that the interpreters can properly
translate their statements. Iwould also like to encourage
delegations to continue to deliver summarized versions
of their statements and circulate their full statements
in writing or post them on their respective web pages.

I now give the floor to the representative of Sweden.
