Mrs. Craft (United States of America): First,
we wish to thank the co-penholders, Germany and
Indonesia, for their diligence and commitment to
drafting a new mandate that will provide the United
Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA)
the guidance needed to advance its core mission. The
United States voted in favour of resolution 2489 (2019)
today to renew UNAMA for one year, with an updated
mandate to address new developments on the ground.

Just last night, terrorist attacks targeted President
Ghani's election campaign rally, claiming at least 26
lives. We condemn those horrific attacks and convey our
sympathies to the victims. The attacks are yet another
reminder of the critical role of UNAMA in supporting
the people and the Government of Afghanistan and
underscore the importance of the Security Council's
duty to provide UNAMA with a strong and full
mandate. This mandate renewal empowers the Mission
to support elections, facilitate peace and reconciliation
efforts and promote good governance and human
rights. However, I should note that the reason we cannot
empower the Mission with a stronger substantive
mandate today is a member's insistence on language
that highlights national political priorities rather than
ways in which we can most effectively assist the people
and the Government of Afghanistan.

We remain steadfast in our commitment to the
people of Afghanistan and to peace in their country.
We look forward to working with the Mission, the
Government and the people of Afghanistan and all
Security Council members to advance peace, security
and human rights in Afghanistan.
