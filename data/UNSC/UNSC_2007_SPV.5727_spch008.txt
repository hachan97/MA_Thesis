Mr. Burian (Slovakia): Slovakia is one the
sponsors of this resolution and welcomes its
unanimous adoption by the Security Council. We
believe that reflects the firm commitment of the
international community to resolve the Darfur crisis as
a matter of priority. Slovakia has been following with
great concern the tragedy in Darfur and the suffering of
the civilian population, especially women and children.
We believe that this unprecedented humanitarian crisis
with grave regional consequences should come to an
end as soon as possible. The adoption of this resolution
is, in our view, a vital step forward in this direction.

We are particularly pleased that this resolution
also reflects the new partnership between the African
Union and the United Nations, which we believe will
be crucial for the future success of the hybrid
operation. Finally, we call on all parties in the Sudan to
facilitate an expeditious deployment of the hybrid
forces and to fully cooperate with the international
community for achieving a lasting and sustainable
solution to the Darfur crisis.
