The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the
Secretary General of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe for his comments.

Given the fact that we are running late, and in my
capacity as President of the Security Council, I should
like to make a change in the format and to ask speakers
to abide by the time limit. I am going to withdraw the
option of second responses from members of the
Council after a response is made by the speaker.

I call on Mr. Fholisani Sydney Mufamadi,
representative of the African Union and the Minister
for Provincial and Local Government of South Africa.
