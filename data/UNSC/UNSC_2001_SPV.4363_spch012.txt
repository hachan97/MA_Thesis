Mr. Kasse (Mali) (spoke in French): Allow me,
Mr. Minister, to tell you how satisfied my delegation is
at seeing you preside over our meeting. Mr. President, I
would like to thank you for having organized this
meeting. I shall confine myself to one single point that
is of interest to my delegation.

Today, in seeking to increase the effectiveness of
the Council, we have to work in the direction of
improving and streamlining our relationship with other
organs of the United Nations, the regional
organizations and the troop-contributing countries. On
the whole, these relationships are not negative; the
Security Council is becoming more and more
transparent and more open to partnerships. But it is
true that we can always do more to improve the
effectiveness of the Council and thus strengthen our
relationships with our partners.

Resolution 1353 (2001), which is the outcome of
the working group chaired by Ambassador Ward of
Jamaica - and we congratulate him once again - is a
very good foundation. Let us examine it carefully and
not waste any time in implementing it, with the active
participation of the troop-contributing countries, who
are our partners from now on.

As the Council, we must encourage regular
meetings with other United Nations bodies and the
regional organizations. Here, I must pay tribute,
Mr. President, to your initiative in organizing the
seminar on regional approaches in Africa. The meeting
on 13 June between the three ambassadors of the
Council and the working group on reform was also
extremely positive. We must continue to speak
candidly among ourselves, because reform is an issue
that concerns all Member States.

This is what my delegation wishes to say today.
Once again, please allow me to congratulate you very
warmly, Mr. President, as well as your excellent team
on the Council and, of course, the one that won the
Copa americana.
