Mr. McLay (New Zealand): New Zealand is
pleased that the Council has now been able to agree
a response to the conflict in Yemen. It has been a
challenging and difficult process to get us to this point,
in which you, Madam President, have led us with great
patience - infinite patience, I might say.

It is important that the Council be seen to be united
in this crisis and equally important that we send a clear
signal about the urgent need for an end to hostilities
and for a return to dialogue and to an inclusive political
process, as agreed previously by the Council.

Resolution 2216 (2015), which the Council just
adopted, imposes consequences for non-compliance.
We hope that that will create further incentives for the
parties to return to the negotiating table, so we reiterate
and support the resolution's call for a resumption of the
United Nations-led political dialogue. That would be in
the best interests of all parties and of the long-suffering
people of Yemen. This time the parties must listen.

We are also very deeply concerned at the
humanitarian situation in Yemen and the impact of the
conflict on civilians, and we re-echo the resolution's
call for all parties involved in military operations to
comply with international humanitarian and human
rights law. That is not an option; it is an obligation.

Absent a political solution to this crisis, that
humanitarian situation will only continue to deteriorate.
So we reiterate the call for all parties to facilitate the

delivery of humanitarian assistance, and we support the
request that the Secretary-General should intensify his
efforts to facilitate a humanitarian pause.
New Zealand will be actively engaged in following
up on progress towards those humanitarian outcomes
that we should all be seeking.
