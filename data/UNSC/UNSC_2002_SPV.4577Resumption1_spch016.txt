Mr. Diarra (spoke in French): ECOWAS is a
subregional organization that is concerned with
integration, with economics, with development. We
believe that development can take place only if there is
peace. With respect to development and integration, we
do in fact have very specific programmes to deal with
economic and monetary issues, as well as issues related
to the fight against poverty. All of those issues will be
part of the New Partnership for Africa's Development.
We do have the willingness. Of course, we do not have
all the means. But we think that, with the willingness
and confidence of our partners, we can move forward.
