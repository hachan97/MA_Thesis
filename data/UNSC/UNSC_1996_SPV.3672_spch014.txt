Mr. Larrain (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish):
My delegation offers you, Sir, its warmest congratulations
on seeing you preside over the Council's work. While
wishing you great success in these responsibilities, we
reiterate our offer of fullest cooperation. I also wish to
convey our gratitude to Ambassador Qin Huasun and his
delegation for their excellent work in May.

My delegation wishes to express its uneasiness and
concern over the incidents of 11 and 12 June, reported by
the Executive Chairman of the United Nations Special
Commission, a Special Commission inspection team was
denied access to sites the Commission had designated.
Such behaviour constitutes an undeniable violation of the
spirit of Security Council resolutions.

We therefore fully support the draft resolution on
this question, since we consider that there is no
justification for the attitude shown by Iraq in refusing to
allow recent inspections by the Special Commission.

We call on the Government of Iraq not to stray from
the path of full cooperation agreed upon with regard to
the Special Commission. Lastly, my delegation wishes to
reaffirm its full support for the Commission and its
Chairman, Ambassador Rolf Ekeus, for the efforts they
have made to implement the mandate of the resolutions of
this Council.
