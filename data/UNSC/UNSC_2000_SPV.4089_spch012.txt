Mrs. Ogata: This is one of the greatest difficulties we
faced in the Zairian camps in 1996, and although through
the Secretary-General we appealed for peacekeeping or
policing arrangements, this was not successful. At the end,
our own colleagues had to devise approaches, which
worked somewhat in the beginning but was not adequate.

In other places, however, we assist the host
Governments with some policing and provide funds,
training and the necessary technical equipment. I think it is
better that we do that than otherwise, but it is far from
adequate in really ensuring neutrality and the civilian
character of refugee camps. Since most of the refugees
today are victims of internal conflict and flee their countries
either temporarily or in an effort to fight back, it is very
difficult to really maintain the camps' civilian character.
We do our very best, but our determined efforts cannot
suffice. I would very much like to receive some ideas on
how to do this.

Internationally, I am told that it is more difficult to get
international police than international peacekeepers, and
what we greatly need in these areas is the presence of
international police, or the strengthening of national police
capacity.
