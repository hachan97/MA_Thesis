The President (spoke in Chinese): I thank Mr.
Morjane for his comprehensive briefing. It is
regrettable that this is the last meeting in which we will
discuss with him the situation in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo together. However, as was said
by the Secretary-General, we will have more
opportunities in the future to meet. This gladdens us.

I shall now give the floor to the members of the
Council who wish to make comments or ask questions.
