Mr. Granovsky (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We agree with the conclusions and observations
contained in the Secretary-General's first progress report
prepared since the establishment of the United Nations
Mission in Sierra Leone. We are pleased that, during this
period, significant progress has been made towards
implementing the Lome Peace Agreement. At the same
time - as made clear in the Secretary-General's report and
the briefing by Under-Secretary-General Miyet - the
overall situation in the country remains unstable. There
have been serious human rights and ceasefire Violations and
the humanitarian crisis continues unabated. In this
connection, the effective presence of the units of the
Economic Community of West African States Monitoring
Group must be maintained.

We fully endorse that position and agree with the
Secretary-General's main conclusions that the key to a
settlement in Sierra Leone lies primarily in the parties'
commitment to the Lome Agreement and in particular to
the implementation of the disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration programme. We are convinced that steps taken
by the people of Sierra Leone to that end will be
unfailingly supported by the international community.

In conclusion, I should like to join in the expressions
of appreciation to the former Special Representative of the
Secretary-General, Mr. Okelo, and to wish the new Special
Representative, Mr. Adeniji, success in his work.
