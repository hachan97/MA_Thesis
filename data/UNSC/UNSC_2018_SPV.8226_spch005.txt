Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): At
present, the United Nations Mission in Support of
Justice in Haiti (MINUJUSTH) should focus on helping
the Haitian Government to shoulder the responsibility
of maintaining national security and ultimately achieve
an orderly drawdown, in line with the national interests
of Haiti and countries in the region.

China believes that the Security Council has the
primary responsibility of maintaining international
peace and security. Currently, the overall situation in
Haiti is stable. The mandate of MINUJUSTH should
be clear and explicit, with a focus on helping Haiti
to address peace and security challenges, rather than
focusing too much on human rights in Haiti. The
members of the Council should have carried out patient
consultations on the draft resolution. When some
members of the Council had concerns about the draft
text, the relevant parties should not have railroaded a
vote. The resolutionjust adopted on does not fully take
into account the legitimate concerns of some members.

China regrets that and therefore voted in
abstention. China hopes that the members of the
Council will continue to remain united, make sure that
the MINUJUSTH implements the two-year drawdown
strategy smoothly and strive to promote stability and
development in Haiti.
