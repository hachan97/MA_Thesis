The President: I note that the representative of the Russian Federation is still able to speak in Russian. It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to the adoption of the draft annual report. May I take it that the draft report is adopted by the Council? There being no objection, it is so decided. This decision will be reflected in a note by the President of the Security Council, to be issued as document S/2020/666. The meeting rose at 10.15 a.m.
