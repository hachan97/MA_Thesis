The President (spoke in Chinese): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2001/615, which contains the text of a note
dated 21 June 2001 by the Secretary-General
concerning the date of an election to fill a vacancy in
the International Court of Justice owing to the
resignation of Judge and former President of the
International Court of Justice Mohammed Bedjaoui,
effective 30 September 2001. That note explains the
need for the item on our agenda.

The resignation of Judge Mohammed Bedjaoui on
30 September 2001 will create a vacancy in the
International Court of Justice which will have to be
filled.

Judge Bedjaoui was elected a member of the
Court as from 19 March 1982 and was re-elected as
from 6 February 1988 and from 6 February 1997. He
was President of the Chamber formed to deal with the
case concerning the Frontier Dispute (Burkina Faso/Republic ofMali, 1983-1986) and was President
of the Court from 1994 to 1997.

Under Article 14 of the Statute of the
International Court of Justice, the Security Council is
to fix the date for the election to fill the vacancy in the
Court. As agreed during our prior consultations on this
matter, the election could take place on 12 October
2001 at concurrent meetings of the Security Council
and the General Assembly.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2001/663, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations. May I take it that the Council is
ready to proceed to take a decision on that draft
resolution?

There being no objection, it is so decided.

In the light of consultations which I have held, it
is my understanding that the Council is ready to adopt
the draft resolution contained in document S/2001/663
without a vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The draft resolution has been adopted as
resolution 1361 (2001).

The Security Council has thus concluded its
business for this meeting.

The meeting rose at 3.45 p.m.
