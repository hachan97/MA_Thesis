Mr. Danforth (United States of America): I
thank President Obasanjo for his briefing and, more
important, for his excellent leadership and for the work
of the African Union, especially in connection with
Darfur. We have now adopted two resolutions in the
Security Council on the subjection of Darfur. The most
recent, resolution 1564 (2004), was adopted on
Saturday. The resolution was designed to give as much
support as we possibly could to the work of the African
Union.

My question relates to whether we are doing
everything that we - that is, the Security Council and
interested countries - should be doing to support the
work of the African Union. Our sense is that time is of
the essence in Darfur. We are told that some 10,000
people are dying each month, and our sense is that the
sooner African Union troops are deployed in Darfur,
the more lives that will be saved. My question,
therefore, is this: is there anything that we should be
doing to facilitate the rapid deployment of the African
Union in Darfur? More generally, is there anything that
the Security Council should be doing that it is not
doing to further peace in Darfur?
