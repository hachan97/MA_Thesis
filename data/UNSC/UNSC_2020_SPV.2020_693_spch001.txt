In accordance with the voting procedure set out in the letter by the President of the Security Council dated 27 March 2020 (S/2020/253), a procedure agreed in the light of the extraordinary circumstances caused by the coronavirus disease pandemic, the draft resolution received 13 votes in favour, 2 votes against (China and the Russian Federation), and no abstentions. The draft resolution has not been adopted, owing to the negative vote of a permanent member of the Council.
