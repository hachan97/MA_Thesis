The President: There has been significant interest
in today's debate, and I have a lengthy list of speakers.
I hope that this indicates a strong interest in Member
States to reposition prevention and peace, placing it
at the heart of the work of the United Nations, and to
express their support for multilateralism as well as for
the new Secretary-General.

In order for all Member States that wish to take the
floor to have an opportunity to do so, I wish to remind
all speakers to limit their statements to no more than
four minutes so that the Council can carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate their texts in writing and
to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber. I would also add that, although it is sparsely
used in the Security Council, applause is actually
not prohibited.

I also wish to inform all concerned that we will be
carrying on this open debate right through the lunch
hour, as we have a very large number of speakers.

I now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs
of Poland.
