The President: I thank the representative of
Guinea for his comments, particularly as they relate to
the regional situation, and for the suggestions he made
as to the way forward.

Mr. Minister, could I ask you two questions? Just
because I asked the Foreign Minister of Sierra Leone
two questions does not mean that I am going to have
two questions for everybody. But there are two things
that came out in your comments.

We have talked about the situation, particularly as
it relates to refugees, but it would be helpful to have a
sense of other areas where you think the situation in
Sierra Leone has had a direct impact on Guinea. For
example, what were the political reactions to the crisis
in Sierra Leone? What kind of affect has there been on
the economy in Sierra Leone?

The other issue that I would like to touch on is
the role that Guinea has played and perhaps could have
played. Do you have any thoughts, looking back on the
situation, on whether Guinea could have been more
proactive in terms of getting international help for the
region, and if so, at what point in the crisis?
