Mr. Polyanskiy (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation voted in favour of
resolution 2447 (2018), drafted by the delegations of
the Netherlands and Cote d'Ivoire, on strengthening
United Nations support in the areas of police, justice
and corrections in peacekeeping operations.

The negotiations were not easy, especially in their
initial stages. Nevertheless, the authors of the draft
proved willing to listen to the conceptual concerns of
other States, which helped to break the deadlock in
the process. The desire to strike a balance among the
interests of all 15 members of the Security Council
enabled a result that initially seemed impossible, the
achievement of consensus on the resolution. In that
connection, I would like to thank the Netherlands and
Cote d'Ivoire for the professionalism and flexibility
they showed during the work on the text, which enabled
the Council to present a united front. We need more
such diplomatic successes in our work.

We also hope that there will be a similarly
constructive approach to the negotiation process on the
other draft resolution, on peacekeeping, proposed by
the same delegations. For the moment, unfortunately,
there are still significant differences of opinion about
it, which should compel us to come up with alternative
options. We hope that other delegations besides the
co-facilitators will respect one another's red lines with
a view to arriving at compromise solutions and unity in
the Council.

The meeting rose at 10.20 am.
