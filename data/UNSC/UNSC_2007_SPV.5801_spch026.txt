Mr. De Riviere (France) (spoke in French): First
of all, I would like to welcome the results of the
mission led by Ambassador Kumalo. That visit has
made it possible to reaffirm the international
community's commitment alongside the people of
Timor-Leste at an important time in the consolidation
of peace, stability and democracy in that country.

I would also like to express our satisfaction with
the commitment expressed by both the Government
and the opposition to resolve the political differences
through peaceful and diplomatic means and with the
commitment shown by all Timorese to democratic
principles. It is normal and healthy that different views
be expressed, as in any democracy. However, it is
important that the political actors make sure that they
do not weaken institutions.

The report of the Security Council mission
(S/2007/711) rightly insists on the importance of
strengthening State institutions, particularly the
security forces and the judicial system. Those are keys
to a lasting stabilization of Timor-Leste. Allow me to
stress in particular the crucial character of
strengthening the rule of law and promoting human
rights. I would like to recall in that regard the
importance that France places on the work done by the
UNMIT Independent Special Commission of Inquiry
on serious crimes.

Progress made in the stabilization of Timor-Leste
in the last 18 months has been significant, and we
welcome the efforts of the authorities and the people of
Timor-Leste to put the country back on its feet. As the
representative of Timor-Leste has just recalled,
however, those strides are fragile. We therefore feel
that the international community should remain
actively involved in supporting the country. We are
ready to review favourably the renewal of the UNMIT
mandate in February 2008.
