The President (spoke in Russian): Before turning
to the item on our agenda, I would like to welcome to
the Council Chamber His Excellency Mr. Heraldo
Munoz, the new Permanent Representative of Chile to
the United Nations, and, on behalf of all members of
the Council, to wish him success in his position.

Expression of farewell to Mr. Wang Yingfan,
Permanent Representative of China to the
United Nations

The President (spoke in Russian): It is my
understanding that our colleague the Permanent
Representative of China, Ambassador Wang Yingfan,
has received an important new appointment and is in
this Chamber for the last time before leaving New
York. We hope that there will be other times in the
future, but today, on behalf of the members of the
Council, I would like to pay tribute to Ambassador
Wang for his important contribution to the work of the
Council and for his diplomatic skill and collegiality, as
well as his common-sense approach to Council issues.
He has represented his country in a very worthy and
effective way. I am certain that in the future he will use
his great talent in his new post.

We will remember Ambassador Wang as a
colleague who always tried to work in cooperation and
harmony with other members of the Council. On
everyone's behalf, I wish him success in his future
work.
