procedure, I invite the representative of Israel to
participate in this meeting.

I propose that the Council invite the Permanent
Observer of the Observer State of Palestine to the United
Nations, to participate in this meeting, in accordance
with the provisional rules of procedure and the previous
practice in this regard.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/ZOIe/IIOO, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Malaysia, New Zealand,
Senegal and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela .

The Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the
draft resolution before it.

I shall first give the floor to those members of the
Council wishing to make statements before the voting.
