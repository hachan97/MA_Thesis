Mr. Akram (Pakistan): Pakistan has voted in
favour of the resolution, and the reasons for our
support are the following. The resolution endorses the
Secretary-General's recommendations for the
amendment of the concept of operations and force level
of United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus
(UNFICYP). Secondly, the resolution decides to extend
the mandate of UNFICYP in accordance with the
recommendations of the Secretary-General and the
wishes of all the parties concerned.

However, the resolution did not take stock of
three important elements, which flow from the
radically changed situation on the ground.

First, it fails to respond to the Secretary-
General's good offices mission report (S/2004/437)
issued in May 2004. That report called on the Council
members to "give a strong lead to all States to
cooperate both bilaterally and in international bodies to
eliminate unnecessary restrictions and barriers that
have the effect of isolating the Turkish Cypriots and
impeding their development" (ibia'., para. 93).

Secondly, it singles out a single resolution in
operative paragraph 1, which, in View of the
transformed situation on the island, is not necessary.

Thirdly, paragraph 43 of the Secretary-General's
report (8/2004/756), on amendments in the concept of
operations and the force level of UNFICYP, indicates
that his review team has consulted with all relevant
parties on the island, as well as the guarantor Powers,
on the concept and proposal to extend the mandate of
UNFICYP. That reality was not mentioned in the fourth
preambular paragraph of the resolution.

I wish to reiterate our unreserved support for all
multilateral and bilateral initiatives and endeavours
seeking a final and comprehensive settlement of the
Cyprus problem, a settlement that is based on
consensus, justice and equity.
