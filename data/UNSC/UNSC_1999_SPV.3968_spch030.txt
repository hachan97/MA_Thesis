The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank
Under-Secretary-General Vieira de Mello for his
comments and responses.

I think that all would agree with me that this has
been a very interesting meeting. The presence of so many
Member States, in addition to the members of the
Council, is an illustration of this, as is the amount of time
we have very productively dedicated to it.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my list.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage

of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 1 pm.
