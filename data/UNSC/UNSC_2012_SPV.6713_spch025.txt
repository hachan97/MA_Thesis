Mr. Hoxhaj: I think that my statement was long
enough to inform the Council of the objective situation
within Kosovo and in the region. However, let me
repeat here that Kosovo is a viable State and in the past
four years, with the support of all Council members -
and I would like to thank them for that support - and
of key State partners, we were able to build a country, a
society and a State from scratch that is today a very
multi-ethnic democracy.

Whatever was said some minutes ago, it does not
reflect the reality there but is just a description of a
world that does not exist, since those who describe
Kosovo never visit it. They do not know what Kosovo
looks like. I am not here to bother the Council with
reports and quotes, but if we refer to a report, we
should simply refer to the European Commission
progress report of last year, which confirmed that
Kosovo had made significant progress in political
criteria and other fields of life.

Today, Kosovo is an independent country. There
are 85 countries that formally recognize the Republic
of Kosovo. Nobody can stop the flow of history. Here,
I repeat our attitude that we are very much in favour of
politics of reconciliation, not of conflict, and of
supporting the European integration of the whole
region.
