Mr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We have had to take the floor once again
with regard to the statement made by the representative
of Ukraine. Our Ukrainian colleagues' attempts to
use any United Nations context to spread trumped-
up accusations about the Russian Federation are not
surprising. It is clear that their assertions are nothing
more than attempts to blame on others what is being
done by Ukrainian armed forces radicals to the
citizens of eastern Ukraine under the pretext of so-
called anti-terrorist operations. The facts show that the
Ukrainian side is fully responsible for the suffering of
children in Donetsk and Luhansk.

Attempts to depict the goal of providing assistance
to children and the efforts to ensure security as some
sort of wrongdoing are particularly cynical. Dozens
of children's lives were taken not because of Russian
aggression, but as a result of the massive artillery and
rocket fire by the Ukrainian armed forces on civilian
targets, including schools and kindergartens. There
have been many eyewitness accounts of that. It is
unfortunate that the Ukrainian delegation does not
understand the futility of trading in the suffering of its
civilians, including the youngest ones.

Once again, we call upon the representatives
of Ukraine not to engage in fruitless politicking and
instead work towards peace and overcoming the
rampant and dire humanitarian crisis in the east of the
country.
