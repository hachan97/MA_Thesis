Mr. Ibrahim (Malaysia): I would to thank Under-
Secretary-General Stephen O'Brien for his briefing
and to start my intervention by expressing our
deep gratitude to the Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs and the humanitarian partners
of the United Nations on the ground in Syria for their
bravery and tireless effort in assisting civilians affected
by the conflict.

Today's debate on the humanitarian situation in
Syria only deepens the Security Council's irreconcilable
differences. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy ofa doomsday
scenario: that nobody will step in to help. That is the
character of the tragic and harrowing human drama that

we are scripting by projecting alternate realities onto the
situation. The Council is too important to be relegated
to witness to processes that take place outside of New
York. We have before us a draft resolution put forth
by New Zealand that aims to solve the humanitarian
question in Aleppo. Despite the pronounced readiness
to engage by almost everyone, we need walk the talk.
