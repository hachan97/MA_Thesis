Mr. Hamer (Netherlands): The Netherlands
supports the political objectives of the draft resolution
before us. There can be no doubt whatsoever that we
utterly reject and condemn international terrorism. The
same goes for the illegal international trafficking of
drugs, which, in the case of Afghanistan, provides the
financial basis for the Taliban's support of international
terrorism. Given these considerations, the Netherlands
thinks it is important that the Security Council should
send a political signal and send it with one voice.
Therefore, we will vote in favour of the draft
resolution.

We appreciate that the authors of the draft
resolution have made a serious effort to target the new
sanctions in order to limit as much as possible their
impact on the civilian population of Afghanistan.
However, we wish to put on record that the
Netherlands continues to be seriously worried about
the humanitarian impact of additional sanctions. The
way in which the authors of the draft resolution before
us have tended to dismiss the serious concerns voiced
in the briefing of the Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs has done nothing to allay our
worries about this aspect of the draft resolution.

Against this background, we call on the Security
Council to continue to weigh the possible humanitarian
and political impact of its sanctions against the
Council's wider political objectives. The Netherlands
recognizes that the extent of the humanitarian impact
of the current draft resolution will depend on the
attitude of the Taliban. It is not acceptable that the
Taliban should use the adoption of the current draft
resolution as a pretext for blocking the delivery of
humanitarian aid or for otherwise hampering the
activities of international humanitarian organizations.
The Council will not allow international or local
humanitarian workers to become the victims of attacks
instigated by Taliban anger over this draft resolution.
