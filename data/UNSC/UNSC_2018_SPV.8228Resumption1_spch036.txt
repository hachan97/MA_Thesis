Mr. Alemu (Ethiopia): We voted in favour of the
draft resolution (S/2018/322) because we saw value in
its adoption as it offered, we thought, the possibility for
the protection of the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons Fact-finding Mission in the Syrian
Arab Republic. Frankly, we tried to find weaknesses
in the text. We could not. It is a matter-of-fact and
uncomplicated draft resolution. We could not find any
reason not to support it. Undoubtedly, it would not have
made achieving attribution possible, but finding out
whether chemical weapon were in fact used would have
been a great achievement.

Of course, so far the Russian position has been
that there was no use of chemical weapons in Douma.
Establishing the facts surrounding that assertion or
position would have been a great achievement. We are
not in a position to take advantage of the guarantee
offered or the Council's strong support in that regard.
We felt that the Fact-finding Mission needed the support.
