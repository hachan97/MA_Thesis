The President: I appreciate enormously your
contribution. I thank you for all the things that you are
doing, notwithstanding the other challenges that we
know you are facing.

I now give the floor to His Highness
Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister for
Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates. Let me
also say how important a partner in many ofthese efforts
the United Arab Emirates has been. We appreciate it
enormously, and thank you for your advice and counsel.
