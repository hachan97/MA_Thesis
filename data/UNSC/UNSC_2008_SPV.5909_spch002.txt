Mr. Grauls: This is the sixth 90-day report to the
Security Council in accordance with paragraph 18 of
resolution 1737 (2006). The report covers the period
18 March to 13 June 2008, during which the
Committee held three sessions of informal
consultations. The Committee also carried out its work
outside the meeting room, using the silence procedure.

As members will recall, by its resolution 1803
(2008) of 3 March, the Security Council adopted
additional measures relating to the Islamic Republic of
Iran. Subsequently, in informal consultations on
18 March and 15 April, the members of the Committee
discussed a revised text of the guidelines of the
Committee for the conduct of its work, with a view to
incorporating the relevant provisions of resolution
1803 (2008). On 24 April, the Committee approved the
revised guidelines.

In those same consultations, given that the names
of individuals and entities subject to the travel ban,
travel notification requirement and/or assets freeze
were available to Member States in the annexes to
three separate resolutions and not in any one place, the
members of the Committee discussed consolidating
those annexes into a single list. The Committee
approved the consolidated document on 24 April. Both
the revised guidelines and the consolidated list of
individuals and entities have been transmitted to all
Member States; they are also available on the
Committee's website.
ln paragraph 13 of resolution 1803 (2008), the
Council called upon all States to report to the
Committee within 60 days of the adoption of the
resolution, that is to say, by 2 May, on the steps they
had taken with a view to implementing effectively
paragraphs 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the resolution. On
27 March, my predecessor, in his capacity as Chairman
of the Committee, transmitted a note verbale to all
Member States drawing their attention to paragraph 13
of the resolution. The note verbale also served as a
reminder to States that had not yet reported under
paragraph 19 of resolution 1737 (2006) and/or
paragraph 8 of resolution 1747 (2007) to do so. Those
States have the option to submit a combined report
under two or all three resolutions, if they so desire.

To date, the reporting figures are: 89 reports
under resolution 1737 (2006), 76 reports under
resolution 1747 (2007) and 51 reports under resolution
1803 (2008). Unless a State requests that its report be
kept confidential, the report is published and posted on
the Committee's website. I wish to add here that, in
response to the suggestion made by the Ambassador of
Burkina Faso during the last briefing to the Security
Council, as well as to requests received from other
Member States, members of the Committee agreed to
post an informal guidance paper on the Committee's
website in order to assist Member States in writing
their national reports. The informal paper has been
reviewed by the members of the Committee but has not
been endorsed by the Committee. The use of the
informal paper is entirely optional.

As members will recall, paragraph 14 of
resolution 1803 (2008) broadened the scope of the
Committee's mandate as set out in resolution 1737
(2006) to also include measures imposed in resolutions
1747 (2007) and 1803 (2008). In informal
consultations on 28 April, it was brought to the
Committee's attention that, as reported in the media,
one Government had made a public statement that
there had been a contravention of resolutions 1747
(2007) and 1803 (2008) on its territory, with respect to
the export ban on arms and related material from Iran.
Subsequently, the Committee approved the dispatch of
letters to the concerned States seeking clarifications
and additional information.

I shall now turn to action taken by the Committee
under resolution 1737 (2006).
08-3802]
Paragraph 13 (b) of resolution 1737 (2006)
provides an exemption to the assets freeze for
extraordinary expenses, as determined by the relevant
States and subject to a Committee decision. The
Committee granted two requests for exemption under
that paragraph. Paragraph 15 of resolution 1737 (2006)
provides for notifications by the relevant States to the
Committee of the intention to make or receive
payments or to authorize the unfreezing of funds in
connection with contracts entered into prior to the
listing of persons and entities in the annexes to
resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007) and 1803 (2008).
The Committee received one such notification.

Paragraph 18 (b) of resolution 1737 (2006) tasks
the Committee with seeking from the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) secretariat information
regarding the actions taken by the Agency to
implement effectively the measures imposed by
paragraph 16 of the same resolution, which defines the
scope of the technical cooperation provided by the
IAEA to Iran, and whatever further information it
might consider in that regard. On 27 March, given that
more than seven months had passed since the receipt of
the initial update, on 22 August 2007, to the report of
the IAEA of 9 February 2007, the Committee invited
the Agency to provide a further update to that report.
By a letter dated 18 April 2008, the IAEA informed the
Committee that no projects had been added to its
technical cooperation programme with Iran since the
issuance of its report and provided an update on
technical cooperation and technical assistance
activities since 22 August 2007. Three requests for
technical cooperation had been considered to be
covered and had proceeded; two others had not. Forty-
four requests for participation in technical assistance
activities had been deemed to be in conformity with
resolution 1737 (2006), whereas a further eight
requests had not.

Lastly, the Committee has pending before it three
written queries from Member States concerning the
implementation of various provisions of resolution
1737 (2006) and resolution 1803 (2008).
