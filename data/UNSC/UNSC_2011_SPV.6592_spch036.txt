The President: Due to the lateness of the hour, I
will skip my national statement. Most of it has already
been covered by others. I will just make three brief
remarks.

First, I thank the Force Commanders for being
with us and giving us this opportunity for an exchange.
I think that it will, indeed, become a tradition.
Secondly, I express high appreciation of their difficult
service in very demanding circumstances and, of
course, through them, of the 120,000 men and women
in the field. Thirdly, I would like to join others in
paying tribute to Alain Le Roy. He has just left the
Chamber, but he knows how highly we regard his
outstanding commitment and leadership in managing
the peacekeeping operations and in taking forward the
challenges of adapting them to the new requirements.

Let us now turn to the questions and answers.
There was one from the representative of France, I
think, of an overarching nature, that is, the question of
reform and how that impacts on missions on the
ground. I take it that it also refers to the New Horizon
agenda. Following a hint by Alain Le Roy, I would
suggest that, in accordance with rule 39 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure, we invite
Major General Obi, Force Commander of the United
Nations Mission in the Sudan, and Major General
Ramos Pereira, Force Commander of the United
Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, to participate in
this meeting and to address those questions because we
can diversify a little and give them an opportunity to
respond on the reform issue.

I give the floor to Major General Ramos Pereira
to answer the question on reform put by the French
representative.
