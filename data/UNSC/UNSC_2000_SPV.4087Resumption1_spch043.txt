The President: Thank you for your very kind
remarks. Once again, I would respectfully request people to
keep their remarks to five minutes.

I would now like to ask the Minister of Health of
Namibia - who has sat very attentively here all day long
through seven hours of speeches and who is the only
Minister of Health here whose country is also a member of
the Security Council - if she would make some very brief
ad hoc observations for all our benefit, but I stress the word
"brief ', Madam Minister.
