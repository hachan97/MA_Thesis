Mr. Jagne (Gambia): My country's policy on the
issue of disarmament in general, and the strict observance
of the regime on the non-proliferation of all weapons of
mass destruction in particular, has always been consistent.
This is why we still acclaim the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) as
beacons of hope in our collective endeavour to make this
world a safer place for present and future generations.

Let me hasten to point out, however, that continued
adherence to the international regime on the non-
proliferation of nuclear weapons will depend to a large
extent on the equal treatment of all States. Having one set
of rules for some and another for others cannot be justified
and is therefore unhelpful and untenable. It goes without
saying that the world would have been a much safer and
saner place if we had all played the game according to the
same rules.

The Gambia' s long-established relations of cooperation
and friendship with both Pakistan and India allow us to
state in no uncertain terms that common sense and goodwill
will always prevail and we are therefore reassured in our
assessment of the situation that the much dreaded nuclear
arms race in South Asia will not even be contemplated and
should not be contemplated.

Finally, by voting in favour of this draft resolution, my
delegation will simply be reiterating its firm conviction that
nuclear disarmament is an obligation of all States without
exception.
