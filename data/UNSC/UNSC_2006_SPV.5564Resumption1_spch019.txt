Mr. Al-Shamsi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of the delegation of the United Arab
Emirates, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate
you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the
Security Council this month and to thank you for your
quick response in convening this important meeting.

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank
your predecessor, the Permanent Representative of
Japan, for his wise stewardship of the Council last
month.

The United Arab Emirates aligns itself with the
statement made by the representative of Qatar on
behalf of the Group of Arab States.

My country has closely followed the truly grave
humanitarian catastrophe of the Palestinian people in
the occupied territories, as embodied in the heinous
massacre committed in cold blood yesterday morning
by the Israeli occupation forces in Beit Hanoun, the
Gaza Strip, which killed at least 20 people, 13 of whom
were from the same family, and gravely wounded 45
others, mostly women and children.

That criminal and gruesome Israeli act, which is
contrary to all international human rights instruments,
could have been fully and easily prevented if the
Security Council had acted from the first day by calling
upon Israel, the occupying Power, to end its open and
brutal war against the people of Gaza, including its
current attacks.

The continuing inaction on the part of the
international community, especially as regards Israel's
gross violations of the human rights of the Palestinian

and Arab peoples, has not only encouraged Israel to
continue its destruction of Palestinian cities and
villages and their vital infrastructure; it has also
encouraged it to launch ferocious military attacks
against unarmed civilians before the eyes of the world.
Israel's military attack against Beit Hanoun - which
included the deliberate, widespread and barbaric
demolition of homes, mass detention, extrajudicial
killings and the targeting of ambulances and
emergency medical personnel - has, over the past
eight days, resulted in more than 70 deaths and the
wounding of at least 300 civilians, 20 per cent of
whom are in critical condition.

The United Arab Emirates would like to declare
its solidarity with the Palestinian people as they face
Israeli massacres and other violations that are
tantamount to genocide - a crime under international
humanitarian law. I wonder how the international
community can believe the justification put forth by
the representative of Israel this morning that the crimes
committed by the Israeli war machine in Beit Hanoun
and the occupied Palestinian territories - in which
they employed the most lethal of weapons - were acts
of self-defence. Israel is committing the most heinous
acts of killing and oppression in violation of
international instruments and norms and in total
disregard for the principles of the Charter of the United
Nations, which guarantee the right of the Palestinian
people to live in dignity, peace, stability and security in
their homeland, like all other peoples of the world. We
therefore reiterate our earlier position that Israel's
ongoing contempt for, and violation of, its obligations
under United Nations resolutions, international law,
human rights covenants and previous agreements
concluded with the Palestinians will not bring about
security and stability for the Israeli people. Rather,
they will lead to increasing frustration among
Palestinians and will escalate violence and tension in
the entire region.

We therefore call upon the international
community, and the Security Council and the Quartet
in particular, to take urgent steps to condemn Israel's
actions, urgently act to investigate those actions, bring
the perpetrators to international justice, compel Israel
to pay the necessary compensation and ensure that it
strictly commits itself to halting its ongoing attacks
against the Palestinian people, especially given the
current conditions in the occupied territories, which
have become very dire. Necessary measures should
also be taken to ensure following: protection for the
Palestinian people; the lifting of Israeli blockades;
Israel's full withdrawal from Gaza and all other
Palestinian and Arab territories occupied since 1967,
including Al-Quds Al-Sharif; and Israel's commitment
to the implementation of all the provisions of the
Fourth Geneva Convention in all the territories, in
accordance with its legal obligations under the
Convention and in line with United Nations resolutions
and the relevant norms of international law.

In conclusion, while we hope that the
international community will not once again fail to
take decisive steps to prevent the escalation of violence
and tension in the Palestinian territories and the
broader Middle East region, we also wish to emphasize
that peace, cooperation and stability in the region will
not be achieved without a demonstration of the
international community's serious determination to
guarantee an end to Israeli aggression, to help the
Palestinian people establish a Government of national
unity and to provide that Government with the
financial and economic assistance necessary to rebuild
the vital State institutions that have been destroyed and
to overcome the current serious humanitarian crisis.
That would pave the way for the establishment of an
environment conducive to the continuation of peace
negotiations to find a just, lasting and comprehensive
solution to the question of Palestine and the overall
situation in the Middle East in accordance with the
Arab Peace Initiative, which supports the vision of two
States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in
peace, security and mutual respect.
