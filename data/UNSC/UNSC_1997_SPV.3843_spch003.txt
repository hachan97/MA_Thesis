The President (interpretation from Spanish): It is my
understanding that the Security Council is ready to proceed
to the vote on the draft resolution [S/ 1997/990] before it. If
I hear no objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the
vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council who
wish to make statements before the voting.
