The President: In accordance with rule 39 of
the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite
the following briefers to participate in this meeting:
Mr. Stephen O'Brien, Under-Secretary-General
for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief
Coordinator, Mr. Amir Mahmoud Abdulla, Deputy
Executive Director of the World Food Programme;
and Mr. Peter Salama, Executive Director of the World
Health Organization Emergencies Programme.

Mr. Salama is joining today's meeting via video-
teleconference from Geneva.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members to
document S/2017/58, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the implementation of Security
Council resolutions 2139 (2014), 2165 (2014), 2191
(2014), 2258 (2015) and 2332 (2016).

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

We met to discuss the implementation of resolution
2336 (2016) and the Astana meeting last week. We look
forward to taking stock, post-Astana, and discussing the
important upcoming United Nations-led Geneva talks
with Special Envoy de Mistura next week. Therefore,
today we focus on the humanitarian situation in order
to try to give it the due attention it deserves.

I now give the floor to Mr. O'Brien.
