The President: I said my little piece before
lunch- and I said it when I assumed the chair -
which was an earnest plea on behalf of the Council -
the Council having agreed that speeches would actually
be limited to three minutes. I do not think it is
necessarily the best of use of time to have texts read
out at some length and subsequently to have the same
texts circulated. When I said three minutes, I meant
three minutes. I am going to ask that from now on
speakers who have texts circulate them - that is on the
record. But could speakers also please enumerate the
key points they wish to make orally, and take three
minutes to do so. But, if, subsequent to this
intervention by the presidency, we have a prepared
speech that goes on for more than three minutes, I will
gavel and that will be it, and the text is going to be
circulated. I therefore appeal very formally to whoever
is speaking, and it will be Jordan next followed by
Australia, to understand that that is how I am going to
do it, out of respect for the Council and for everyone
else; rather than necessarily do it in quite such a
formalistic manner. I think that is what the Council
expected me to do and that is what I will try to do.
With thanks to everyone who has contributed, could we
try to do it that way, which will be more interactive as
well.

The next speaker is the representative of Jordan,
on whom I now call.
