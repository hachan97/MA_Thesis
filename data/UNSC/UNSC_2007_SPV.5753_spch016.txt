Mr. Arias (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): First of
all, allow me to join Panama's voice to those of the
other Member States that have thanked the Secretary-
General for his participation, and Mr. Gambari for his
effort in handling the sensitive situation in which
Myanmar finds itself.

I would also like to recognize the manner in
which today's debate is being held. I think the fact that
we are having an open meeting, with the participation
of Myanmar and of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN), promotes transparency in the
actions of the Security Council. I am sorry that we
have not been able to find a suitable mechanism
through which to hear the voice of the Human Rights
Council or the United Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights, whose participation on this topic is
indispensable.

I must also express my regret at the fact that we
have not yet heard the representatives of either
Myanmar or ASEAN, before the members of the
Council expressed their views. I think it would have
been preferable to listen to them first, before speaking
ourselves.

Everything indicates that there is clarity and
understanding as to the facts in Myanmar and the goals
to be attained: protecting human rights, the release of
the prisoners, the need for a national understanding
free from external interference. All of those goals seem
very clear. What is being discussed is how to achieve
those goals. In Panama's view, those are objectives that
we should try to attain through a unified effort by this
Organization, and not through separate initiatives of its
various entities and organs.

In this context, the delegation of Panama
welcomes the statements that have been made by
ASEAN and welcomes in particular the support for the
resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council. We
feel that any gesture by this Council should be
undertaken in a manner consonant with those previous
declarations.
