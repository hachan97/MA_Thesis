The President: There are no more speakers
inscribed on my list.

I would therefore like once again to thank
Foreign Minister Karti and Mr. Amum for their
participation in today's debate.

In accordance with the understanding reached in
the course of the Council's prior consultations, I should
now like to invite Council members to informal
consultations to continue our discussion of the subject.
