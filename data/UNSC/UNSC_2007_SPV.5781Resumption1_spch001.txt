The President: I wish to remind all speakers, as I
indicated at the morning session, to limit their
statements to no more than five minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
Representatives with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to circulate the text in writing and to deliver
a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.
