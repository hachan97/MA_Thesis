Mr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian): The principled approach of the Russian
Federation to assessing the priorities of the activities of
the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force at this
stage is well known and has repeatedly been described by
the Russian delegation in the Security Council. We View
this United Nations operation as an important element of
the system to monitor compliance with the arms embargo
and with the ban on external assistance to terrorist
activities in Kosovo and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, in accordance with Council resolution 1160
(1998).
The period since the adoption of Security Council
resolution 1186 (1998), which made the relevant
monitoring tasks part of the Force's mandate, has given
ample evidence of the growing urgency of this work. In
monitoring the observance of the arms embargo and other
injunctions established by resolution 1160 (1998), this
Force is making an important contribution to stabilizing
the situation in Kosovo and to the success of international
efforts to achieve a peaceful political settlement of the
crisis, as well as to guarantee the security and stability of
the entire Balkan region.

Our position is that the functions of the United
Nations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP)
involved in monitoring compliance with the arms
embargo and with the injunctions established by
resolution 1160 (1998) should become the main
component of UNPREDEP's activities, and this should be
more clearly highlighted in the mandate of this operation.

Guided by this approach, the Russian delegation
proposed corresponding amendments to the draft
resolution on the extension of UNPREDEP's mandate,
which is under consideration today. Unfortunately, these
amendments were not duly reflected in the final text of
the draft resolution, which does not fully take account of
the importance of principle in reorienting UNPREDEP to
monitor compliance with the arms embargo.

Under these circumstances, the Russian delegation
will not be able to support the draft resolution.
