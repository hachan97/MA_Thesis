Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I want to repeat
something that I have said before in the Chamber.
Criticizing the United Nations for doing its job should
not be the task of anyone speaking in the Chamber. I
know that we need to have free speech and I know that
we need to be frank. But the United Nations, including
the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs, has done an outstanding job in Syria.

The meeting rose at 11.55 a.m.
