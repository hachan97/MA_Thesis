I will be speaking in my capacity as Security Council Facilitator for the implementation of resolution 2231 (2015). As Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo just recalled (annex I), the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was a major achievement in the domains of nuclear non-proliferation, dialogue and diplomacy. I was therefore honoured to serve the Council in that capacity during the few months of my mandate. Given that this will be my first and last briefing to the Security Council in that capacity, I would like to thank my predecessor, Ambassador Marc Pecsteen de Buytswerve, and my collaborator, Caroline Pailhe, for their work, as well as the Secretariat team for its unfailing support. I am very grateful to them for their dedication. Let me turn now to the tenth report of the Facilitator (see S/2020/1244). It was approved by all members of the Council, whom I thank for their pertinent contributions, their spirit of compromise and their flexibility. The report comprises a factual account that, in conjunction with the tenth report of the Secretary-General (S/2020/1177) on the implementation of resolution 2231 (2015) and the report of the Joint Commission to the Security Council on the status of the Procurement Working Group's decisions and on any implementation issues (see S/2020/1164), serves to inform the Security Council about activities under the auspices of the 2331 format. My tenth report covers activities that took place from 24 June to 17 December 2020. Members can refer to the text of my report for greater detail, but I would like to mention the following two points. First, I would like to recall that the Council held a meeting in the 2231 format during the reporting period. On 14 December 2020, representatives of the Security Council responsible for the implementation of resolution 2231 (2015) considered the conclusions and recommendations contained in the tenth report of the Secretary- General before its public release. Secondly, 37 notes were circulated under the 2231 format during the reporting period. In addition, I sent 23 official communications to Member States and/or the Coordinator of the Procurement Working Group of the Joint Commission. I received 23 communications from Member States and the Coordinator. Those communications included the two regular quarterly reports issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) during the reporting period in September (S/2020/1003, enclosure) and November 2020 (S/2020/1138, enclosure), as well as four updates in July (S/2020/1002, enclosure), October (S/2020/1137, enclosure), November (S/2020/1139, enclosure) and December 2020. I cannot overstate the value of the central, impartial, factual and professional role played by the Agency, which continues to verify and monitor the activities of the Islamic Republic of Iran pursuant to resolution 2231 (2015). Throughout my mandate, it was my ambition to support the implementation of resolution 2231 (2015) on behalf of the Security Council by focusing on three specific areas: dialogue, transparency and maintaining the supply chain. The various letters distributed under the 2231 format reflect the state of the deliberations among the parties concerned. Those communications are listed and summarized in detail in my report, together with the responses issued by the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations. Two aspects in particular caught the attention of Member States during the reporting period. First, on 20 August 2020 the Secretary of State of the United States of America addressed a letter to the President of the Security Council (S/2020/815), indicating that the United States was initiating the process described in paragraphs 11 and 12 of resolution 2231 (2015), which would lead to the reintroduction of the measures that had been lifted pursuant to paragraph 7 (a). Subsequently, 13 members of the Security Council expressed differing views on that letter. All communications submitted in that regard by interested parties, including the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Secretary-General, are duly reflected in my report, as well as the subsequent statement by the President of the Security Council in August. Secondly, according to annex B, the sanctions against arms transfers to and from the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as the travel ban, expired on 18 October 2020. Differing stances on that matter, too, were expressed by Member States in letters circulated during the reporting period. The divergent views on those two points touch on issues that lie at the heart of the JCPOA and of resolution 2231 (2015). I cannot but commend all interested parties that have shown restraint and a great willingness to cooperate in order to reach consensus on my report. In that collaborative approach, I see some hope for the future. In that regard, I would like to echo the support expressed by the Secretary- General and the Coordinator of the Joint Commission for maintaining the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. In conclusion, I recall paragraph 2 of resolution 2231 (2015), which "calls upon all Member States, regional organizations and international organizations to take such actions as may be appropriate to support the implementation of the JCPOA, including by taking actions commensurate with the implementation plan set out in the JCPOA and this resolution and by refraining from actions that undermine implementation of commitments under the JCPOA".
