The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
special report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, contained in document
S/2002/ 1005 . Members of the Council also have before
them document S/2002/1309, which contains the text
of a draft resolution prepared in the course of the
Council's prior consultations.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it, as
amended in the course of its consultations. Unless I
hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to
the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Bulgaria, Cameroon, China, Colombia, France,
Guinea, Ireland, Mauritius, Mexico, Norway,
Russian Federation, Singapore, Syrian Arab
Republic, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, United States of America.

The President (spoke in Spanish): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution, as amended, has
been adopted unanimously as resolution 1445 (2002).

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 11.50 a.m.
