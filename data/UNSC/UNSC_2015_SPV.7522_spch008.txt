Mrs. Kawar (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): I would
like first to extend my thanks to the Permanent
Representative of Spain for his valuable briefing and
for his leadership in the work of the Security Council
Committee established pursuant to resolution 1737
(2006). I would also like to thank the Panel of Experts
for their efforts and the preparation of relevant reports.

Jordan welcomed the agreement signed on the
Iranian nuclear file and the diplomatic and political
efforts deployed by all parties to reach that agreement.
Jordan has always supported a diplomatic settlement
of the Iranian nuclear issue, and any steps that could
contribute to establishing regional security, peace and
stability. In that context, we call upon the Committee
to continue to perform its mandated tasks and follow
up the application of the relevant resolutions during
the transitional period until the agreement is applied
and the Security Council receives the International
Atomic Energy Agency report indicating that Iran
has implemented all measures regarding its nuclear
programme, pursuant to resolution 2231 (2015).

We would also like to encourage States that have
not submitted reports on steps taken for the application
of the relevant Security Council resolutions to do so as
soon as possible and to cooperate in a positive manner
with the Panel of Experts, as the success of the work of
the Committee depends upon the submission of those
reports.

In conclusion, we value the role of the Committee
in assisting States and international institutions to
implement the relevant Security Council resolutions.
