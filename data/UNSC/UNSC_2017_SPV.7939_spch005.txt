Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian delegation supported the adoption
of compromise resolution 2352 (2017), on extending the
mandate of the United Nations Interim Security Force for
Abyei (UNISFA) . It is our view that, even if working at
limited functionality, the Joint Border Verification and
Monitoring Mechanism remains of great importance
for the entire process for inter-Sudanese solutions.

Fully halting UNISFA's support for the Mechanism
seems illogical and destructive, notjust in Abyei but in
the entire region. It is our hope that both the Sudan and
South Sudan will heed the clear signal from the security
Council regarding the need to activate the mechanisms
established by the agreements on Abyei so as to make
progress in the process of the political settlement.

We are pleased that, at the end the day, common
sense prevailed and a resolution was adopted that
reflects the views of leaders of the region, and is not
limited just to narrow financial concerns. While indeed
significant questions remain regarding the working
methods of the penholders, who to the very last minute
procrastinated in finding a compromise, we would
nonetheless like to express our support for the activities
of UNISFA and welcome the efforts of Ethiopia's as
the troop-contributing country that bears the primary
burden for the maintenance of peace and stability in
the region.
