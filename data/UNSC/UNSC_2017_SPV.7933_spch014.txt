The President: There are no more names inscribed
on the list of speakers.

Before adjourning the meeting, as this is the last
scheduled meeting of the Security Council for the
month of April, I would like to express the sincere
and heartfelt appreciation of a delegation of the United
States to the members of the Council, especially our
colleagues the Permanent Representatives and Deputy
Permanent Representatives and their excellent teams, as
well as to the hard-working secretariat of the Council,
for all the support they have given to us this month. It
has been a busy month, and one in which we rallied
to consensus on several important issues within our
purview. We could not have done it without the hard
work and contributions of Council members and the
representatives of the Secretariat, as well as the support
of Conference Service Officers and, especially, the
support of our interpreters. As we end our presidency,
I know I speak on behalf of the Council in wishing the
delegation of Uruguay the best of luck in the month
of May.

The meeting rose at 7.05 pm.
