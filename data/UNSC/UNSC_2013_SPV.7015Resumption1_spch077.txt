The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now
speak briefly in my capacity as the representative of
Argentina.

Argentina's position with regard to its sovereignty
over the Malvinas Islands is well known and reference
was made to it this morning.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

The representative of the United States wishes to
make a further statement.
