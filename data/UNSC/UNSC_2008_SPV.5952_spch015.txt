Mr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): We regret that
following the emergency meeting of the Security
Council earlier today, the intense fighting in the South
Ossetian conflict zone is escalating to a new level. My
delegation once again calls upon the parties to exercise
restraint, renounce the use of force and expeditiously
resume direct talks to end the hostilities.

We commend and support the international efforts
to help defuse the situation, restart peace talks and
facilitate the rehabilitation process. We will continue to
work with the other Council members to ensure that
the Council responds in a timely way to the current
dramatic developments in the South Ossetian zone of
conflict, with a view to de-escalating tension and
bringing the parties to the negotiating table.
