Mr. Yang Tao (China) (spoke in Chinese): We
welcome the presence of the Foreign Minister of
Turkey, Mr. Davutoglu. We also appreciate the
presence of Her Excellency the Deputy Secretary-
General. I also wish to thank Mr. Fernandez-Taranco
for his briefing.

China is shocked by Israel's attack on the
multinational convoy carrying humanitarian aid to
Gaza, which resulted in heavy casualties. We condemn
Israel's actions targeting humanitarian workers and
civilians. We wish to express our condolences on the
bereavement of Turkish citizens and those of other
nationalities. We support a quick response by the
Security Council and its taking necessary actions.

At present, the humanitarian situation remains
grim in the occupied Palestinian territory, especially

the Gaza Strip. China expresses its serious concern. We
urge Israel to immediately and fully implement Council
resolution 1860 (2009), to fully open border crossings
and to lift the blockade on the Gaza Strip so as to allow
the unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid and allow the
local people to achieve early recovery and the
restoration of their normal lives.
