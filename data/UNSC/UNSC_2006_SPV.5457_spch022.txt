Mr. Dolgov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We thank Mr. Ian Martin, Special Envoy of
the Secretary-General for Timor-Leste, for his detailed
briefing on the situation in Timor-Leste and for the
efforts undertaken to normalize it. We also heard with
great interest the statement of Mr. Ramos-Horta,
Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence of Timor-
Leste.

The Russian Federation is concerned about the
continuing serious crisis in Timor-Leste. The situation
there remains very complex and unstable. Of particular
concern are the increasing tension among ethnic groups
in Timorese society and the increase in internal
political conflict. However, we cannot fail to note the
positive effect of the prompt deployment - at the
request of Timor-Leste's leaders - of international
military and police forces from Australia, Malaysia,
New Zealand and Portugal and of United Nations
efforts to help resolve the crisis.

We greatly appreciate the activities of the
Secretary-General; his Special Envoy, Mr. Ian Martin;
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General,
Mr. Sukehiro Hasegawa; and all the staff of the United

Nations Office in Timor-Leste. Of course, there is still
much work ahead of them.

The crisis in Timor-Leste has clearly shown how
weak and unstable that country's major State
institutions remain, against a background of major
social and economic problems. It is essential that the
parameters and modalities for a future United Nations
presence in Timor-Leste be commensurate with the
country's needs. We expect the Secretary-General to
make specific recommendations in that regard. We
hope that they will take into account the lessons of this
crisis and the wishes of Timor-Leste's leaders.
