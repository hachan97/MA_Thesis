The President: After consultations among
members of the Security Council, I have been authorized
to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council supports the statement
issued in New York on 20 September 2005 by the
Quartet, which is annexed to this statement.

"The Security Council urges the
Government of Israel and the Palestinian
Authority to cooperate, along with other parties
concerned, with the efforts to achieve the goals
set out in the Quartet statement.

"The Security Council calls for renewed
action in parallel by the Government of Israel and
the Palestinian Authority on their obligations in
accordance with the road map, to ensure
continued progress towards the creation of an
independent, sovereign, democratic and viable
State of Palestine living side by side with Israel
in peace and security.

"The Security Council stresses the
importance of, and the need to achieve, a just,
comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle
East, based on all its relevant resolutions
including its resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973),
1397 (2002) and 1515 (2003), the Madrid terms
of reference and the principle of land for peace."

This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2005/44.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
