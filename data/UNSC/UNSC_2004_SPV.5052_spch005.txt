The President: I thank Mr. Mendez for his
statement.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to request that all
speakers from now on limit their statements to no more
than five minutes in order to enable the Council to
carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with
lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate the
texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version
when speaking in the Chamber.

I now extend a warm welcome to the Speaker of
the House of Representatives of the Philippines, His
Excellency The Honourable Jose De Venecia.
