The President: The Council will now proceed to the
consideration of its annual report to the General Assembly,
the draft of which has been prepared by the Secretariat. I
wish to note that, in accordance with the decision taken in
June 1993, this is the third instance in which the Council's
report is considered in a public meeting.

I now call on the Director of the Security Council
Affairs Division of the Secretariat to make an explanatory
statement.
