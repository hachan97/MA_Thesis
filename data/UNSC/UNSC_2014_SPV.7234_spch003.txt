The President: I thank Mr. Ging for his briefing.

I shall now give the floor to the members of the
Security Council.

I would like to recall for the Council the provisions
of note of the President of the Security Council
contained in document S/2010/507, which encourages
both members and non-members of the Council to
deliver their statements in five minutes or less. As
communicated to Council members in advance of the
United Kingdom presidency, it is our intention to use
the flashing light on the collar and at the base of the
speaker's microphone to indicate when five minutes
have elapsed. I shall strongly encourage both members
and non-members of the Council to conclude their
remarks promptly once five minutes have elapsed.
