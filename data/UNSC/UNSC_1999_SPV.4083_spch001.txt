The President: In accordance with the understanding
reached in the Council's prior consultations, and in the
absence of objection, I shall take it that the Security
Council agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Bernard Miyet,
Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
I invite Mr. Miyet to take a seat at the Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

At this meeting the Council will hear a briefing by the
Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations on
the situation concerning the Democratic Republic of the
Congo.

I now give the floor to the Under-Secretary-General
for Peacekeeping Operations, Mr. Bernard Miyet.
