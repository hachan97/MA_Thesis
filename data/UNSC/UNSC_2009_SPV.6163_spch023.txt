Ms. Winter: I do not wish to take up much of the
Council's time. We have had a meeting of great
importance, especially to the Special Court for Sierra
Leone. Once again, I would like to express my
gratitude in the name of the Court and thank the
Council for the continuous help that we have received
so far. I urge the Council not to forget all those Victims
and witnesses who risked so much to come forward
and help justice to achieve its cause. I urge the Council
not to forget us now in our final efforts to complete our
work. I thank all its members very much.
