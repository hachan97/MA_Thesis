Ms. Mueller: I would like to respond to the question
raised by the representative of Poland on disaggregated
data. To ensure disaggregated data, it is very critical
to have effective humanitarian programming and to
be aware of the specific and diverse needs of people
with disabilities, because humanitarian assistance is
effective only if it is inclusive.

Humanitarian partners are now collecting
disaggregated data. Sex, age and disabilities are
aggregated into our planning estimates, and we
continue to refine our data so as to allow us to target
humanitarian programming for those most in need. We

extended the period for assessing the needs in Syria for

the 2019 humanitarian needs overview, as those present
know. That was released in March for this year and
provides a comprehensive overview of needs, including
for persons with disabilities.

What is important now is to see the support of the
donors to help us address those needs. While $7 billion
were pledged at the Brussels Conference to support
those in need in Syria and the region, this year's appeal
is funded by only 8 per cent. We must therefore do
more, and we can do more. Humanitarian agencies and
the United Nations stand ready to continue providing
humanitarian assistance and protection to the people in
need in Syria.

As for the question raised by the Ambassador of
the United Kingdom on water access improvements and
challenges, the Secretary-General's report (S/2019/321)
addresses the expanded access that the United Nations
has in areas under Government control. There were
over 1,200 missions deployed throughout the country
in February and March. We have two main challenges,
which I would like to highlight.

First, we have called for access to Rukban to deploy
the third aid convoy and we received information on
Monday that it is not possible, as I mentioned, which
makes that the first biggest challenge. Secondly, we
need access to send staff to the north-east to support
operations in the Al-Hol camp.
