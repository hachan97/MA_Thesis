Mr. Baali (Algeria)(spoke in French): Algeria
welcomes the Security Council's unanimous adoption
of a resolution vigorously condemning all acts of
terrorism in all their forms, thus significantly
enhancing our campaign against a phenomenon that
constitutes one of the greatest threats to international
peace and security today.

We welcome the resolution, first, because it has
created at just the right time the possibility of
extending to other terrorist individuals and groups
measures imposed hitherto only on individuals and
groups affiliated with Al Qaeda, thereby responding to
a long-standing request of my country.

We also welcome the resolution because it
addresses yet another persistent concern of my country:
the need forcefully to strengthen judicial cooperation
in combating terrorism, particularly with respect to
prosecution and extradition, which the resolution
enshrines as a fundamental principle.

Finally, we welcome the resolution because it
avoids any conflation of acts of terrorism and the
legitimate rights of peoples to resist foreign
occupation. That principle is dear to Algeria and has
been fully enshrined in international law and United
Nations resolutions.
