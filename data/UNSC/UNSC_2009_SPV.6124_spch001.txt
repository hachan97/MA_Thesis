The President (spoke in Russian): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of the Czech Republic and Somalia,
in which they request to be invited to participate in the
consideration of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the consideration of the item, without
the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

On behalf of the Council, I wish to extend a
warm welcome to His Excellency Mr. Mohamed
Abdullahi Omaar, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the
Transitional Federal Government of Somalia.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Omaar
(Somalia) and Mr. Kaiser (Czech Republic) took
seats at the Council table.

The President (spoke in Russian): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend invitations under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Lynn Pascoe,
Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs;
Mr. Alain Le Roy, Under-Secretary-General for
Peacekeeping Operations; and Ms. Susana Malcorra,
Under-Secretary-General for Field Support.

It is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on Somalia pursuant to
2
Security Council resolution 1863 (2009), document
S/2009/210.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear
briefings by Mr. Lynn Pascoe, Mr. Alain Le Roy and
Ms. Susana Malcorra.

I now give the floor to Mr. Pascoe.
