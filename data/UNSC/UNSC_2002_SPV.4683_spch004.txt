Mr. Duclos (France) (spoke in French): In
adopting resolution 1447 (2002) on 4 December, the
Security Council committed itself to doing everything
possible to review the contents of the Goods Review
List, as well as the procedures for its implementation
within 30 days. Today the Council has achieved this.
To our way of thinking, more time could have
been provided for negotiation so that the Council
would have been able to speak in unity. We also have
questions, to say the least, regarding the method by
which this negotiation was conducted, or, at least,
begun.

However, France voted in favour of the draft
resolution, because in substance it respects the
fundamental objective of the Goods Review List: to
alleviate the suffering and to improve the humanitarian
situation of the Iraqi population, while avoiding the
import by Iraq of dual-use goods. We also note that the
resolution provides that the Goods Review List and the
procedures for its implementation can be reviewed very
soon and at regular intervals.

For our part, we retain the option of making use
of that opportunity in order to advance, as far as may
seem desirable, the deletion of items and the easing of
the procedures.
