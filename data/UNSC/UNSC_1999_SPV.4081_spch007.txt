The President: I thank the Ambassador of the
United States of America, and welcome the points he
made. I also congratulate his Government on the attention
that it will be giving Africa during its presidency next
month. I think Africa is now getting more attention, for
the right reasons, than it perhaps has ever had. We need
to make something of that.
