Mr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): Aware
of the need for consensus in the Council and at the
request of the African Union, and bearing in mind the
necessity of coordination with and the approval of the
Sudanese Government for a transfer of responsibilities
from the African Union forces to a United Nations
force, my delegation voted in favour of resolution 1679
(2006), as amended. My delegation interprets the
amendments as being required in conformity with
resolution 1591 (2005), and that they do not imply that
the Security Council is prepared to carry out the
transfer prior to the approval of the Sudanese
Government, in accordance with paragraph 4 of that
resolution.

My delegation will continue to support every
effort to establish peace in Darfur.
