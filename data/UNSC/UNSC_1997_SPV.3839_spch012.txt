Mr. Liden (Sweden): Sweden has been a troop
contributor since the very start of the United Nations
Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP). As such, we
;are proud to be a part of this very successful first United
Nations preventive deployment mission. UNPREDEP will
no doubt serve as an example for future preventive action
by the Security Council.

The situation on the ground having improved, it is
now possible to- start considering alternative forms of
international presence in the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia. The withdrawal of the military component of
UNPREDEP after the expiry of the mission's mandate in
August next year must not mean the end of international
support for the sovereignty and stability of the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. My Government looks
forward to the recommendations of the Secretary-General
in June next year on how further to assist that country.

In more general terms, the success of UNPREDEP to
date highlights the importance of the concept of preventive
action. The lesson we have learned is that the international
community, and in particular this Council, must act early
and choose the adequate measures from the wide range of
instruments available for conflict resolution. In the case of
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, preventive
deployment of United Nations troops was clearly the right
choice at the right time.

Another lesson could be that for a mission of this kind
to be considered a success and an example for the future,
it should not be prolonged indefinitely and without change.
As circumstances on the ground evolve, the international
community must be prepared to adjust the instruments of
conflict resolution accordingly. This is what we want the
United Nations to do in the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia next year.

Sweden will vote in favour of the draft resolution
before us.
