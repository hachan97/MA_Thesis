Mr. Fernandez Amunategui (spoke in Spanish):
I would like to express my most sincere thanks to
the Guatemalan presidency for having organized this
meeting, espeecially as this is the first time that that
country has assumed the presidency of the Security
Council since the United Nations was founded. I think
that this is a very important moment for us.

I would also like to express my gratitude for
the unanimous support for the recommendation of
the Secretary-General, his report (S/2012/678) and
the extension of the mandate of the United Nations
Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) for a
further year. I would also like to express my deepest
thanks for the support expressed for the work of
MINUSTAH. I believe that the men and women of
the Mission richly deserve such support, and it was
delivered most eloquently.
Lastly, I wish to express my personal thanks to the
international community. In today's debate, we have
noted how institutional and political progress is leading
to greater stability in Haiti. That progress has truly been
due to the unified voice and action of the international
community, especially the permanent diplomatic
presences in Haiti, but also the missions that have
visited and the diplomats and embassies represented
here. There has never been a single dissenting voice
in our efforts to politically stabilize Haiti. Quite the
contrary: we have always had very active agreement,
which has been felt by the Government, public
opinion, the opposition, Parliament and civil society.
This concord has made an extraordinary contribution
to continued progress. I cannot say that no progress
would have been achieved without it, but I believe that
the difficulties would have been much greater and the
progress much more minimal. Therefore, I wish to
thank and congratulate the international community

on behalf of MINUSTAH for the outstanding work we
have been able to achieve.
