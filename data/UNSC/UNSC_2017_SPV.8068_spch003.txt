The President (spoke in French): I thank Ms. Sandra
Honore Braithwaite for her briefing and would like to
take this opportunity to express our gratitude for her
exemplary commitment and the quality of her work
and that of her entire team in the service of peace and
stability in Haiti.

I now give the floor to the members of the
Security Council.
