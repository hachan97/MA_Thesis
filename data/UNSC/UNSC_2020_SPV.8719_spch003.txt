Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Russia abstained in the voting on resolution 2509 (2020), submitted by Germany and the United Kingdom, which extends the sanctions regime on Libya, as the text did not include our important and duly justified comments. The sponsors of the resolutionincluded new language on the illicit importation of oil products into Libya. We would like to underscore that the negative impact of importing oil products is not that obvious for the Libyan economy. Now in Libya, due to the decline in production of its own processing faciliies, three quarters of oil products, by volume, are being imported nd a great part of the imported products is diverted by armed groups to the internal black market or to other countries. We must not forget about the needs of the Libyans who live in the east of the country and are not getting any oil products delivered to them. In that regard, we would like to underscore that the natural resources of Libya should be used for the good of the people and should not serve the interests of third States. All questions pertaining to the control of oil infrastructure and export operations should be decided by the Libyans themselves.
