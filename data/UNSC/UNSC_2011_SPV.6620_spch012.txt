The President (spoke in Arabic): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of Lebanon.

Following its forced absence, and now that it has
resumed its place in the Arab world, Libya is now
resuming its natural place in the United Nations. We
welcome Ambassador Dabbashi. The Security Council
has shouldered its responsibilities vis-a-vis Libya and
its responsibility to protect civilians by various means,
including coercive measures. It has also called
repeatedly for a ceasefire along with the launching of a
political process. The Secretary-General has supported
these efforts through the activities of his Special
Representative, Mr. Al-Khatib, and his Special Adviser,
Mr. Martin.

However, the Al-Qadhafi regime, which had lost
all legitimacy, did not respond to the calls of the
Security Council. Today, Libya, through the sacrifices
of its sons, has new facts on the ground. A new
democratic State protecting the rights of all Libyans
and their fundamental freedoms is being built. The
Security Council has again responded to the needs of
Libyans as put forward by their legitimate
representatives, the National Transitional Council, by
creating a support mission to help the Libyan people
fulfil the priorities they set for themselves. In this
context, we cannot fail to reaffirm the pivotal role of
the United Nations in coordinating international and
regional assistance to Libya.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Libya.
