Mr. Djani (Indonesia): Indonesia welcomes the adoption of resolution 2510 (2020). We thank the penholder and the members of the Security Council for their constructive engagement. We would like to thank Germany for hosting the Berlin Conference. But today's resolution is not only about the Berlin Conference. It is about giving a chance for peace to take place in Libya. It is about giving hope to the Libyans that peace is not elusive. It is about saving the lives of the Libyans. It has been 11 months since the outbreak of the current crisis in Libya, and the attention of the world is upon us, the Security Council. Indonesia voted in favour of resolution 2510 (2020) so as to fulfil our moral obligation and our solemn duty as a member of the Security Council. We support the international efforts to find peace in Libya, which enjoy Libyan support and have continued in a Libyan-owned and Libyan-led process. Libya's sovereignty and territorial integrity are of the utmost importance. We support the work of neighbours and regional organizations to help resolve the conflict in the country. We support the work of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya and of Special Representative of the Secretary-General Ghassan Salame, including his three-step plan and multi-track approach. We have heard his plea, and the Council must step up. We call on the parties in Libya to make use of the tools available to them and engage in peaceful dialogue in good faith and with an honest interest in the future of Libya. We call on everyone to adhere to their commitments under international law, as well as to respect the arms embargo and create a conducive atmosphere so that peace can prevail.
