Mr. Toro-Carnevali (Bolivian Republic of Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): We are greatly
encouraged by the Council's unanimous adoption today
of resolution 2336 (2016), submitted by the Russian
Federation and Turkey in support of the urgent call by
the Syrian people and the international community for
a cessation of hostilities on the ground and a speedy
start to negotiations for a political settlement that
can provide a comprehensive peaceful solution to
the conflict in Syria. In that regard, we welcome the
meeting to be held in Astana at the end of January
between the Syrian Government and the opposition,
and we wish it every success. It will be particularly
important to ensure that the agreements forged by
Russia and Turkey - along with resolution 2328 (2016),
adopted on 19 December - form an integral part of
the determined efforts of the Special Envoy of the
Secretary-General, Mr. Staffan de Mistura, establishing
once and for all the conditions and standards for all
the national, regional and international stakeholders
and supporting the peace process. With the adoption
of today's resolution, Venezuela leaves the Security
Council proud of having helped the Syrian people to
reach this important moment.

We congratulate you, Mr. President, on the success
of your presidency, and we thank the Secretariat for all
the support it has given us over the past two years.
