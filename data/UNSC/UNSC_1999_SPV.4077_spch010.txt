Mr. Andjaba (Namibia): The humanitarian situation
of the civilian population in Iraq as a result of the
punishing sanctions has been of concern to my delegation
since the day we entered the Security Council as a
member. In our view, the oil-for-food programme,
although limited in what it can achieve, therefore plays a
major role in alleviating this plight. It is our view that
everything should be done to ensure that it is not
disrupted. On the other hand, we remain equally frustrated
by the inability of the Council to address the Iraqi issue
comprehensively. It was for this reason that the Council
agreed that the permanent five should try to resolve the
differences among themselves.
However, today I have to express our frustration that
no clear resolve is yet available. Instead, it now appears
that the continued existence of the oil-for-food
programme is threatened by the very same political
differences which created the impasse previously. We
urge the permanent five to speed up their consultations so
that the omnibus resolution may be brought back to the
Council.

My delegation would have preferred a full six-month
renewal of the oil-for-food programme. However, we
voted in favour of the one-week extension in the hope
that it will assist the Council in coming to a conclusion
on the comprehensive resolution.
