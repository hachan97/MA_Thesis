The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank Mr.
Guehenno for his briefing and for the way in which he
stressed the importance of this occasion: the
completion of the United Nations Mission of Observers
in Prevlaka.

Following consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council welcomes the

Protocol signed by the Government of Croatia

and the Government of the Federal Republic of

Yugoslavia on 10 December 2002, establishing a

provisional cross-border regime on the Prevlaka

peninsula, as referred to in the letter from their
permanent representatives dated 10 December

2002 (S/2002/1348). The Protocol represents a

further step forward in the process of

strengthening of confidence and good-
neighbourly relations between both countries.

The Council welcomes the commitment of both

Governments to continue negotiations on

Prevlaka with a View to amicably resolving all

outstanding issues, and commends their

diplomatic efforts to bolster peace and stability in
the region.

"The Council commends the important role
played by the United Nations Mission of
the

Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP) in helping to
create conditions conducive to a negotiated
settlement of the dispute. The Council takes this
opportunity to express its appreciation for the
efforts of all UNMOP personnel, past and
present, and its gratitude to those countries that
contributed personnel or other resources in the
successful completion of its mandate."

This statement will be issued as a document of
Security Council under the symbol

S/PRST/2002/34.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my

list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 12.10p.m.
