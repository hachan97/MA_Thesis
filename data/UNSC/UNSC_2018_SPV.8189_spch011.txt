Mr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (Spoke in Spanish): I
should like to thank the Special Envoy of the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General for Burundi,
Mr. Michel Kafando, for his important work. We also
thank the Permanent Representative of Switzerland to
the United Nations, Ambassador Jiirg Lauber, in his
capacity as Chairman of the Burundi configuration of
the Peacebuilding Commission.

We share the concerns expressed by the Secretary-
General in his report on the situation in Burundi
(S/2018/89), in particular on the need to reactivate the
inter-Burundian dialogue under the auspices of the East
African Community and other regional organizations.
Similarly, in the light of reports of the deterioration of the
human rights situation, we encourage the Government
to strive for real progress in its relations with the Office
of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.

Finally, we share the opinion that the proposed
revision of the Constitution is a matter that falls within
Burundi's domestic sovereignty, but at the same time we
believe that the initiative should be conducted through
an inclusive process that ensures the broad participation
of the population. Furthermore, taking into the content
and spirit of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation
Agreement for Burundi, which put an end to a tragic
period of violence that must never recur, we support
the work of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General,
other United Nations agencies and friendly countries in
the framework of preventive diploacy, in full respect
for Burundi's sovereignty.
