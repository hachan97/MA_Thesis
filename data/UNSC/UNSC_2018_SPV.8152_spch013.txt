Mr. Tanoh-Boutchoue (cote d'Ivoire) (spoke in French): As I speak for the first time in the Security
Council Chamber, I would like to wish everyone a
happy new year. I would also like to congratulate you,
Mr. President, on your assumption of the presidency of
the Council for the month of January.

With your permission, Mr. President, I would like
to salute and thank the countries leaving the Council,
particularly those from the African continent, for
the support they have given us in preparing for our
membership in the Council.

My delegation would like to thank you, Sir, for
convening today's meeting. We would also like to thank
Mr. Zerihoun, Assistant Secretary-General for Political
Affairs, for his briefing on the situation in Iran. My
delegation takes note of his briefing, which brings us up
to date on the latest developments in the socio-political
situation in the country. Based on the latest information
in its possession, it welcomes the gradual return to
normalcy on the ground and hopes that this trend will
continue in the best interests of the Iranian people. In
keeping with its policy of dialogue in a crisis situation,
my country, Cote d' Ivoire, calls upon the parties, in
particular the Government and the demonstrators, to
continue to pursue dialogue with a view to finding a
peaceful resolution of the problems underlying the
present situation.

In conclusion, my delegation hopes that earnest
initiatives will be taken by the Iranian authorities to
bring calm and serenity back to the Iranian people, so
that they can pursue together the necessary economic
reforms that will lead to the country's development.
