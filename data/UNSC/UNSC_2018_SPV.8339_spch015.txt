Mr. Orrenius Skau (Sweden): Let me begin by
joining others in congratulating you, Madam President,
in assuming your role for this month. Let me also echo
others in praising the United Kingdom presidency for
the manner they led the Security Council during the
month of August.

We have no objections to the provisional programme
of work. We look forward to this month. It is important
for the Council to assume its responsibility and come
together on the wide range of issues on its agenda.
We wish the presidency the best of luck. You, Madam
President, and your team have our full support.
