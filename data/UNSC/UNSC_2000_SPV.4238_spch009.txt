The President: In terms of logistics, when I flew
in last night I first thought that we could do this in the
morning. But I think members will agree with me that,
if we are a little bit realistic, I should actually suspend
the meeting for lunch and then we should return in the
afternoon. I am actually planning to do that around
1.15 p.m., and then we could come back at 3 pm. I
thought it would be useful to announce that I have
given up in terms of trying to finish our debate before
lunch.
