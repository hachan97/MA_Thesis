The President: I thank Mr. Roed-Larsen for his
comprehensive briefing. I would like to congratulate
him on his tenure as envoy. He has been engaged on
the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations for more than
a decade, and his service and dedication are recognized
by all concerned.

In accordance with the understanding reached in
the Council's prior consultations, I should now like to
invite Council members to informal consultations to
continue our discussions on the subject.

The meeting rose at 4.30 p.m.
