Mr. Sajdik: In the past nearly four years
Ambassador Apakan and I have been able to divide our
work quite well. I will therefore refer to the statement by
the chairmanship of the Organization for Security and
Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) that was issued today.

I do not think that I need to quote it word by word
but I will say that the Slovak chairmanship believes that
Russia's unilateral measure

"could undermine the efforts for a peaceful
resolution of the crisis in and around Ukraine,
and calls for adherence to the OSCE principles
and commitments by all its participating States.
The chairmanship invites all sides to refrain from
unilateral steps and to jointly continue searching
for ways to fully implement the Minsk agreements."

That is just one part of today's statement.

I should like to add the answer I provided to a
journalist, who I believe was from TASS, at my press
briefing in Minsk concerning my assessment. I said the
following to him in Russian:

(spoke in Russian)

"As you know, I have always been committed to
following the letter and the spirit of the Minsk
agreements, based on the principles of the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine".

(spoke in English)
With regard to the question asked by the
representative of Russia as to why no agreement was
reached yesterday on the Easter truce, I believe that I
addressed that in my briefing. I can only repeat what
I said, which is that, unfortunately, the sides could not
agree on the text of the statement. We proposed two
texts, both of which had previously been adopted on
the occasion of earlier ceasefires. In this specific case,
sadly, neither text was found acceptable. One text was
unacceptable for the Ukrainian side, while the other
was unacceptable for the Russian representatives and
the representatives of certain areas of the Donetsk and
Luhansk regions. Despite all the efforts of Ambassador
Apakan, we were unable to reach an agreed text.
