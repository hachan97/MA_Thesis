The President (spoke in French): I thank the
Permanent Observer of the League of Arab States for
the kind words he addressed to the presidency.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran. I invite
him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his
statement.
