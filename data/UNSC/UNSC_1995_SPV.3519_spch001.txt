The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of
Japan, in which he requests to be invited to participate in
the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the discussion without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Owada (Japan)
took the place reserved for him at the side of the
Council Chamber.

The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them document
S/ 1995/292, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by Argentina, Oman, Rwanda, the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the
United States of America.

The first speaker is the representative of Japan. I invite
him to take a place at the Council table and to make his
statement.
