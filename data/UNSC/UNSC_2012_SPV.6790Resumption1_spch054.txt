Ms. Amos: The number of countries participating
in the debate today demonstrates its timeliness. I am
encouraged that the majority of States have referred
to the core challenges to enhancing the protection of
civilians and the need to redouble our efforts to ensure
compliance with the law.

I welcome the concern expressed by a number
of States regarding the need for improved casualty
reporting to address the humanitarian impact of the
use of explosive weapons in populated areas, to prevent
attacks against and interference with health-care
workers and facilities, and the need for a comprehensive
and robust arms trade treaty.

Many speakers have also underlined the importance
of ensuring accountability for those who violate the law.

Attention has also been drawn to the importance
of safe, timely and unimpeded humanitarian access.
I welcome the focus on compliance and access.
Humanitarian actors must be able to engage with armed
groups if we are to make progress on both of these
issues.

Some States have expressed concern at the
Secretary-General's focus in the report (S/2012/376)
on engagement with non-State armed groups. There is
no one-size-fits-all approach to engaging such groups.
Engagement for exclusively humanitarian purposes is
essential to our efforts to seek improved protection for
civilians and ensure safe and sustained access.

I look forward to continuing to work with the
Council in addressing protection of civilians concerns
and issues relating to humanitarian action more broadly
as well as with individual Member States.
