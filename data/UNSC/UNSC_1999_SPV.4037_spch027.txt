The President: I thank the representative of Gambia
for his kind words addressed to me.

There are still a number of speakers remaining on
my list for this meeting. In view of the lateness of the
hour, I intend, with the concurrence of members of the
Council, to suspend the meeting until 3.30 p.m.

The meeting was suspended at 1.30 p.m.
