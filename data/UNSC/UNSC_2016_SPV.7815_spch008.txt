Mr. Gasso Matoses (Spain) (spoke in Spanish):
Spain supported today the extension of the mandate of
the Joint Investigation Mechanism since it considers it
fundamental that the Mechanism continue carrying out
its work and that, as the Security Council decided in
previous resolutions, those responsible for the use of
chemical weapons in Syria be held accountable.

The work of the Mechanism is not yet over, and the
reality that we face is troubling. New allegations on the
use of chemical weapons keeping coming in, and Joint
Investigative Mechanism has already shown that it has
a deterrent effect that we need to preserve. Spain is
particularly pleased that the resolution we have adopted
today includes references to cooperation between the
Committee established pursuant to resolution 1540
(2004) and the Joint Investigation Mechanism. This is
logical since the 1540 (2004) Committee is a subsidiary
body of the Council that ensures that non-State actors
do not have access to or use nuclear, chemical or
biological weapons.

Moreover, I trust that this Mechanism will be given
adequate resources to carry out the work that we have
entrusted to it. I am particularly grateful for the efforts
of the United States Mission and the Russian Mission
for reaching consensus within the Council once more on
this occasion. The unity that the Council has once again
shown on this issue is a hopeful sign on which we must
build a united and robust Security Council response,
one that the citizens of Syria have been waiting for.
