Mr. Naranjo (Costa Rica) (interpretation from Spanish): The Government of Costa Rica, in its capacity
as spokesman and Secretary pro tempore of the Central
American Presidential Summits, is profoundly pleased by
the decision being taken today in the Security Council.

The signing of the peace agreements in Guatemala
on 29 December 1996 was the culmination of a difficult
peacemaking process in the region of more than a decade.
It is with great joy that we in Central America are
celebrating this historic event. There is peace in
Nicaragua, there is peace in El Salvador, and now, after
36 years, Guatemala, our dear sister country, is also
achieving peace.

 

Today Central America, in peace and freedom, and
deeply committed to respect for human rights and for the
environment, is preparing to meet the challenges of the
future in the framework of the Alliance for the Sustainable
Development of Central America. This unique experience
unites the seven small countries of our isthmus more than
ever.

All Central Americans are profoundly grateful to all
members of the Council for the decision that is being taken
this afternoon, which will make it possible for a United
Nations contingent to verify compliance with the peace
agreements in Guatemala. We are especially grateful to
you, Mr. President, and to you, Mr. Secretary-General, for
your endeavours to achieve a satisfactory agreement. We
express our respect and appreciation to China for its
support for this decision, which is crucial for the
completion of the process of peacemaking and
democratization in Central America. We again offer our
appreciation and thanks to the countries of the Group of
Friends of Guatemala, which have helped and cooperated
so much in this process. And to the people and the
Government of Guatemala in particular, we offer our
sincerest congratulations.
