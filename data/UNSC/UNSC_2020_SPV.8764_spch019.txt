The President: First of all, I have to say for the record that I have not been here for 75 years. That is a bit excessive. Secondly, sitting here in the chair as President, it is difficult for me to state clear rulings on who is playing games here. I think that I should better reserve that for my statement in my national capacity. Thirdly, I too recall the situation referred to from 2018, in relation to which the name of Ambassador Kuzmin has been invoked (see S/PV.8209). The difference was that there were no alternative proposals. There was one proposal. That was all. Today we have two. So what shall we do in these circumstances? This is clearly a procedural question that we have to decide before voting. The representative of China has asked to make a further statement.
