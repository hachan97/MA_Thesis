Mr. Mohammad Kama] (Malaysia): My
delegation would like to underline its deep regret that
the Council was unable to reach consensus on the
resolution we have just adopted. It is unfortunate that
the sponsors of the text did not share the view that
adopting a technical resolution today to extend the
mandate of the United Nations Mission for the
Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) would
have sufficed while awaiting further discussion on a
more substantive text that would better reflect the
commitment of the Council to the settlement plan.

We wish to underline Malaysia's continued full
support for the United Nations settlement plan, which
we still believe to be a viable one, and hope that an
early, durable and peaceful resolution of the dispute
will be achievable in the not-too-distant future. In this
regard, we join the call for the parties to the dispute to
bring concrete solutions to the meeting to be held with
the Secretary-General's Personal Envoy in order to
resolve all outstanding settlement plan issues.

We voted in favour of the resolution, as we fully
support the efforts of MINURSO to implement the
United Nations settlement plan and agreements adopted
by the parties to hold a free, fair and impartial
referendum for the self-determination of the people of
Western Sahara. We also support the Secretary-
General's recommendation to extend the mandate of
MINURSO until 31 July 2000, in the expectation that
the parties will offer the Secretary-General's Personal
Envoy specific and concrete proposals that can be
agreed to in order to resolve the outstanding problems
relating to the implementation of the United Nations
settlement plan.
