Mr. Gonzalez de Linares Palou (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): I shall be very brief and concise.

I wish to express my satisfaction and that of
my country at the adoption today of resolution
2235 (2015), which was co-sponsored by Spain. In
adopting the resolution by consensus, the Council
has demonstrated that it is both serious and resolute.
Of primary importance is our seriousness in insisting
that there can be no impunity, particularly for those
who commit grave violations of international law that
can be considered to be war crimes or crimes against
humanity; those who violate the most basic and sacred
norms of international law and trust, and those who
ignore the Security Council's resolutions, all of whom
must be made accountable for their actions. Today the
Security Council has lived up to its responsibilities. If
we are to ensure our seriousness, we as a Council must
act consistently in the future. Today we have taken a
first step in calling on the Secretary-General to begin
work on setting up a Joint Investigative Mechanism, but
once the Mechanism is under way, we must act on its
recommendations and findings.

Secondly, today we have sent a message to the
international community that we are determined to do
everything possible to put an end to the worst conflict
of the twenty-first century. The unity we have shown
today must also be translated into other areas of the
Syrian conflict, and today's success should push us to
continue to work together to reach the only possible
solution to it, which is a political one. I would therefore
like to conclude by saying that we reiterate our firm
support for the work being done by Special Envoy
Staffan de Mistura.
