Mr. Oh Joon (Republic of Korea): We thank
Deputy Secretary-General Eliasson and Assistant
Secretary-General Simonovic' for their briefings and
for the devotion they have shown in their activities
taken with respect to Ukraine.

The Republic of Korea is deeply concerned about
the recent developments in that country. The Republic
of Korea will not recognize the referendum in Crimea
nor the annexation of Crimea by Russia. We call on
Russia and the Crimean authorities to refrain from
further hasty actions. We urge them to immediately
enter into meaningful discussions with the Ukrainian
Government and the international community, with a
view to finding a peaceful political solution.

Implications of any boundary alterations on the
existing international order must be fully taken into
account. We hope that space exists for a negotiated way
forward. In that context, we greatly value the ongoing
mediation efforts by the international community,
particularly those of the Secretary-General. We look
forward to the continued constructive role of Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon in that regard.

Once again, we reiterate our firm support for the
sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of
Ukraine. All the relevant international and bilateral
agreements, especially the Charter ofthe United Nations
and the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, must be fully
observed. It is also vital that the rights of all persons
in Ukraine, especially of minorities, be protected. The
future of Ukraine should be considered and decided
upon based only upon the will and aspirations of all
Ukrainians themselves, without any intervention or
influence by outside forces.
