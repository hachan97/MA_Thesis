The President (spoke in French): I ask the
representative of Senegal to thank President Macky
Sall for his hospitality and kind words addressed to me.

Before adjourning this meeting, I wish to thank
the members of the Security Council, the international
community and the countries we invited to attend for
sending their representatives, as well as the members
and non-members of the Security Council that spoke
today. I also wish to extend special thanks to my
brothers Mr. Moussa Faki Mahamat and Mr. Jean-
Claude Brou for coming to be here with us today.

This debate has been particularly rich and
enriching. I have learned a great deal by listening to
today's speakers. I too would note that reconstruction
and reconciliation are long-term endeavours. We need to
get to work; we cannot let ourselves believe that we have
already won the battle. Relapse is a very real possibility
and we must remain highly vigilant. The Government
and the people of Cote d'Ivoire will greatly benefit
from the important statements, comments and remarks
made today. The resolutions that will emanate from our
presidency in relation to peacekeeping will be beneficial
for everyone, particularly for the African continent. We
will endeavour to provide appropriate solutions.

I would like to highlight that this has been a
wonderful moment for me and for the people of Cote
d'Ivoire. We are very proud to have had this opportunity,
for which I thank the Council both personally and on
behalf of my delegation.

The meeting rose at 1.30pm.
