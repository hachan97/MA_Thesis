Mr. Spatafora (Italy): I just want to add my
voice to the voices of the other sponsors. With this
resolution, we have wanted to demonstrate a strong
support for the Government of Lebanon, a strong
support for the sovereignty and independence of
Lebanon, and a belief that justice is a condition for the
reconciliation and therefore the stability of the country.
We truly hope that in the coming days and weeks the
internal forces and players in Lebanon will find a way
and the right path to implement the agreement.
