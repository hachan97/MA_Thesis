Ms. Schoulgin Nyoni (Sweden): I would like to
briefly echo colleagues in expressing support for the
unanimous adoption of resolution 2357 (2017), which
provides a legal framework for the implementation of
the arms embargo on the high seas offthe coast ofLibya.

The continued proliferation and smuggling of
weapons to and from Libya remain a serious threat to
peace and security. They escalate the already volatile
situation on the ground, fuel the threat of terrorism and
contribute to the destabilization of Libya and the wider
region. In addition, they risk undermining the only path
to long-term peace and stability in Libya, namely, a
Libyan-led, United Nations-supported political process
based on an inclusive Libya Political Agreement.

Breeches of the weapons embargo and the military
escalations are directly impacting the security of the
civilian population. In fact, more civilians were killed
or injured in May than in any other month this year,
falling victim to, for instance, gunfire, airstrikes and
explosive devices. All actors have a responsibility to
ensure the protection of civilians in accordance with
international humanitarian law.

As of today, the European Union Military Operation
in the Southern Central Mediterranean (EUNAVFOR MED) Operation Sophia is the only actor implementing
resolution 2292 (2016), now extended by resolution
2357 (2017). Through its concrete interventions and
deterrent effect, it is contributing to the implementation
of the arms embargo. In light of the challenges facing
Libya, we welcome the renewal of Operation Sophia's
mandate to continue its important work. We wish to
thank the United Kingdom for its work on the renewal.
By adopting resolution 2357 (2017), the Council has
sent a unified message on its continued commitment to
peace, security and stability in Libya.
