The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them document
S/2017/153, which contains the text ofa draft resolution
submitted by Senegal.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members to
document S/2017/111, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on developments in Guinea-Bissau
and the activities of the United Nations Integrated
Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau.

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the voting.
