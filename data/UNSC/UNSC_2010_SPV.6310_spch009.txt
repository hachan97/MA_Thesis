The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank
Mr. Apakan for his briefing.

In accordance with the understanding among
Council members, I wish to remind all speakers to
limit their statements to no more than five minutes in
order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing and to
deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.
