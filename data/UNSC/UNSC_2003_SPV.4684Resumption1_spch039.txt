The President (spoke in French): I should like to
take this opportunity, on behalf of the members of the
Security Council, to say that we regret the departure of
the Permanent Representative of Colombia, to thank
him for his very valuable contribution to the Council's
work over the past two years, and warmly to wish him
every success in his future endeavours.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Malawi. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
