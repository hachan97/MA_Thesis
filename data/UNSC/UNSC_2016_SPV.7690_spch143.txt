Mrs. Ozkan (Turkey): I apologize for taking the
floor once again at this late hour, but I was compelled
to do so, given the allegations just made by one
delegation. We categorically deny the allegations made
by the representative of the Syrian regime, which long
ago lost all legitimacy.

What Turkey does for the brotherly people of Syria,
in close cooperation with international organizations,
including the United Nations, takes place before the
eyes of the international community. Turkey is hosting
more than 2.5 million Syrians, offering them shelter,
protection, health care and education. As the suffering
and destruction caused by the regime continues, as
seen by the latest appalling attack targeting a camp of
internally displaced persons in Idlib province, I just
would like to emphasize that Turkey will continue to
stand by the people of Syria.
