Mr. Power (United Kingdom): My Ambassador has
apologized for the fact that she had to leave the meeting
and has asked me just to make a couple of final points
on the substance of the issue at hand today, as opposed

to some of the extraneous points that have been brought
up by some speakers. My points refer back to the strikes
on the hospitals.

The Russian Ambassador asked a question about
the difference between hospitals that were attacked
in Syrian Government-controlled territory and those
attacked in rebel-held territory. The difference is that
in the rebel-held territory in Idlib, the Russians were
supplied with information about those medical facilities
through the de-confliction mechanism we have been
discussing today. So the question that my Ambassador
asked, as to how it came about that those hospitals
and medical facilities found themselves under attack,
remains a legitimate one.

We further find it slightly astonishing that the
Russian Ambassador was surprised that the number of
hospitals had increased during the civil war. We think
that this is a natural consequence of the attacks that
have been taking place on civilians and was the reason
why the mechanism was created in the first place. To
reiterate the point, we will answer the questions posed
to us, but will they answer questions posed to them?
