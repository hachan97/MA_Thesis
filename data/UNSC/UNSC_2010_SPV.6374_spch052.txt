The President (spoke in Russian): I thank
Ms. O'Brien for her clarifications.

I thank all delegations that took part in today's
meeting - and the members of the Secretariat - for
their very valuable contributions to the discussion,
which will undoubtedly enrich future work to counter
piracy off the coast of Somalia.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 2.25 p.m.
