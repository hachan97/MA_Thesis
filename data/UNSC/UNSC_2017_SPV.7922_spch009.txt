Mr. Bessho (Japan): Japan voted in favour of the
draft resolution (S/2017/315) proposed by France, the
United Kingdom and the United States.

The reported use of chemical weapons in Khan
Shaykhoun was an affront to humanity and a blatant
Violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions.
Given the gravity of the situation, it is very important
for the Council to express its determination to address
this issue.

It is truly regrettable that we have witnessed another
instance of division in the Council despite the clear need
to address the incident. What just happened here does
not and must not affect the Council's determination
concerning this matter. We must expeditiously
determine whether chemical weapons were actually
used, identify those who are responsible and hold
them accountable. Japan welcomes the opening of the
investigation by the Fact-finding Mission to the Syrian
Arab Republic of the Organization for the Prohibition
of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and urges it to report its
conclusion as soon as possible.

The Syrian Government and all parties in Syria
have the obligation under resolutions 2118 (2013) and
2235 (2015) to fully cooperate with the OPCW and the
United Nations, including the OPCW-United Nations
Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM). In addressing the
continuous allegations of the use of chemical weapons
in Syria, Japan believes that it is increasingly important
to further improve coordination between the Fact-
finding Mission, the JIM. and the Council so that the
Council can react more swiftly to the alleged use of
chemical weapons.
