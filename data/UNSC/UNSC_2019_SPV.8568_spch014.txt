The President (spoke in Arabic): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of Kuwait.

We would like to begin by thanking the French
delegation, which, as penholder, put forward resolution
2480 (2019). We also thank the French delegation for
its collaboration with all Council members during the
deliberations on this resolution.

We voted in favour oftoday's resolution because we
are fully convinced that the situation in Mali requires
the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated
Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) to be a
peacekeeping mission with a robust and comprehensive
mandate. We underscore the importance of renewing
the Mission's mandate for another year with a view to
ensuring continuity in its work, in particular given the
many political challenges and security threats in the
north and centre of Mali.

We believe that the tasks set out in the resolution
presented by France today address the situation in the
best way. The Mission is called upon to implement the
objectives in accordance with the priorities entrusted to
it by the Security Council. That would undoubtedly lead
to making progress on the political track with a view
to addressing the situation in Mali. We also welcome
the expansion of the Mission's mandate in the centre
of Mali, a region that recently faced many difficult
security challenges.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Mali.
