The President: I thank the Minister of Health of
Namibia, and I hope she will extend our appreciation to
her Government in Windhoek for sending her here today,
and to her for making this long visit. I hope she will
convey to the peoples and fellow African Ministers the
historic and unprecedented nature of today's meeting.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Indonesia. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
