Mr. Denisov (Russian Federation)(spoke in Russian): The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia
today discussed the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in
telephone conversations with the Palestinian Authority
and with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Israel. He
emphasized, in the course of those discussions, that the
important thing now is to take urgent steps in order to
put an end to the current dangerous situation of
confrontation. Since, as we understood it, the main
objective of the draft resolution was to stop the
violence, it was, in principle, acceptable to us -
although in our view it should have been more
balanced. We therefore proposed to our Algerian
colleagues that they make several changes to the draft,
and since those proposals were partially taken into
account, we took the decision to support the draft
resolution.
