Mr. Mano Queta (Guinea-Bissau) (interpretation from French): The peace process in the Middle East could
be jeopardized if the international community and the
parties concerned do not act to halt the military escalation
in southern Lebanon and to relaunch the peace process
that is under way in the region. The recent military
operations against cities and towns in southern Lebanon
must be the concern of the entire international
community, because they violate the relevant resolutions
of the Security Council, in particular resolution 425
(1978).

As we have already said on many occasions, our
country has condemned the acts of terrorism recently
perpetrated in Israel against the innocent civilian
population. None the less, we deplore any act of violence
that could bring suffering to innocent people, wherever
they may be. In this respect, we wish to express our full
solidarity with the civilian population of Lebanon and, in
particular, with the families of the victims. These cycles
of violence serve only to give rise to renewed feelings of
hatred in the region, which jeopardize peace and security.

For humanitarian reasons, we urgently appeal to the
international community to come to the aid of the
suffering population of Lebanon.

In conclusion, we reiterate our conviction and our
hope that, with determination and goodwill on the part of
all those concerned, the provisions of the peace accords
will soon be relaunched in the region so that a just,
lasting and comprehensive peace can be established in the
Middle East. We thus call for an immediate cease-fire so
that negotiations can resume.
