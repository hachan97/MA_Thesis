The President: At the outset of the meeting, I
should like, on behalf of the Council, to express deep
condolences to the Government and the people of India
and of Pakistan in connection with the earthquake
which occurred today in western India, resulting in
considerable devastation and loss of life. I am sure that
members of the Council share my feelings on this
matter.

Expression of farewell to the outgoing Legal
Counsellor for the United States Mission

The President: I should like also to take this
opportunity to bid farewell to Mr. Bob Rosenstock, the
Legal Counsellor for the United States Mission.
Mr. Rosenstock has been at the United States Mission
since 1964. I understand that in 1964, there were 115
States Members of the United Nations. Today, there are
189. Hundreds of representatives have come and gone,
but Bob has stayed on to work on those issues that are
so important to us all. I can say this with some
conviction, because when I came here for the first time
as an ambassador, from 1984 to 1989, Mr. Rosenstock
was already a legend then. He should know that
everyone in this room will miss him when he leaves. I
hope the members of the Council will nowjoin me in a
round of applause to bid farewell to a colleague who
has been with us for 37 years.

I give the floor to Mr. Rosenstock.
