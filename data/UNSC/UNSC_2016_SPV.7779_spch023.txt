Mr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I merely wish to briefly clarify the fact that,
as I understand it, the interpretation of my statement
was not entirely accurate. My reference to the fact
that the suffering of civilians in Syria must come to
an end was interpreted incorrectly. In that respect, we
would ask members to refer to the correct version of our
statement, which, as always, shall be circulated later.
