The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank the
representative of Canada for the important and
effective role he has played and, before him,
Ambassador Bob Fowler, as Chairman of the sanctions
Committee on Angola.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Swaziland, whom I invite to take a
seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
