The President (spoke in Chinese): There are no
more speakers on my list.

I think that today's open meeting has been very
helpful. We have heard a wide range of views of United
Nations Members, in particular of the African Members,
on the situation in Sierra Leone. Undoubtedly, many ideas
and suggestions expressed during the meeting will
contribute to the Security Council's consideration of the
situation in Sierra Leone.

The Security Council will remain closely seized of
the matter and will further discuss the subject as required.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 11.25 p.m.
