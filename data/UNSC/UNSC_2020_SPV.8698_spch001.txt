The President: As this is the first formal meeting of the Security Council this year, I should like to extend my warm wishes on the occasion of the New Year to all members of the Security Council, the United Nations and the Secretariat. In presiding over this first formal meeting of the Council in 2020, I am happy to welcome the new members: Estonia, the Niger, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Tunisia and Viet Nam. We look forward to their participation in the work of the Council. Their experience and wisdom will be of invaluable assistance in the discharge of the Council’s responsibilities. I shall also take this opportunity to express the Council’s gratitude to the outgoing members — Cote d’Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Kuwait, Peru and Poland — for their important contributions to the work of the Council during their terms. Expression of thanks to the outgoing President
