Mr. Mufioz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): We might
have preferred a different meeting of the Security
Council to congratulate you, Ambassador Negroponte,
on your assumption of the presidency, to offer you our
best wishes and to assure you of our cooperation, as
well as to thank Ambassador Jones Parry for his
excellent work during the month of September.

Events in the Middle East in recent hours prompt
Chile to make the following statement. First of all, we
condemn the Israeli air force bombing on Syrian
territory, which is an outrage against international law
and the principles and purposes of the United Nations
Charter. Such conduct is unacceptable and dangerous,
because it can widen the conflict and pose additional
threats to international peace and security in the Middle
East.

Similarly, Chile firmly and harshly condemns the
repugnant terrorist attack in Haifa, which killed 19
innocent people and injured some 50 others. Such
violence against civilians can never be justified. Chile
has condemned in the past and will continue to
denounce and condemn all acts of terrorism, whatever
their origin. We reject any attempt to justify such acts.

Suicide attacks followed by the destruction of
civilian homes, air strikes and further acts of terror
constitute a vicious circle of violence that must stop.
We appeal to both Syria and Israel to be prudent. We
call on them to exercise all due restraint in order to
avoid the taking of even graver decisions that would
escalate the violence.

The international community views with alarm
these developments and their impact on the peace
process and the road map on which the Quartet is
seeking to make progress for the benefit of the
majority, who, we believe, seek peace and coexistence
among Israel, Palestine, Syria and all other neighbours
in the region.
