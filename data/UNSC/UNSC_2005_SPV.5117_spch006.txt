Mr. Kitaoka (Japan): Japan attaches great
importance to the role of the United Nations Interim
Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and welcomes the
adoption of the resolution to renew its mandate for
another six months.

The Japanese delegation has paid particular
attention to two points, namely, the ninth preambular
paragraph and operative paragraph 7. With regard to
the ninth preambular paragraph, Japan believe that,
thanks to extensive discussions and valuable
contributions by the members of the Council, we were
able to agree on well-balanced language that reflects
decisions taken by the Security Council in the past.

With regard to operative paragraph 11, Japan, as
one of the largest financial contributors to
peacekeeping operation activities, upholds the basic
position that all peacekeeping missions should be
under constant review with regard to their mandates
and structures, particularly in the light of the rising
demand for, and the changing character of,
peacekeeping operations in the world. The need for
review applies to UNIFIL as well. In the light of
UNIFIL's importance, we consider this paragraph to be
appropriate in order to enhance its effectiveness and
efficiency.
