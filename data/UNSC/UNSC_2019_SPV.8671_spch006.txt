Mr. Madeira: At the beginning of my statement
I mentioned that there are signs of hope in Somalia as
we look forward to 2020. Allow me to end on the same
optimistic note. The recent rapprochement between
Somalia and Kenya is a testament to the potential that
exists in the Horn of Africa. The measures agreed
between both countries will no doubt have a positive
impact on both the neighbouring sisterly countries.

We are going to implement the threat assessment
decision that was taken by this body. Concrete steps
have been taken and things are going well.
