Mr. Oyarzun Marchesi (Spain) (spoke in French):
Today we are all French. We are all Malian.

(spoke in Russian)

And, dear colleagues, we are also Russian and
Arab.

(spoke in French)

It is time to react, and to do so with a French
heart - with a Russian, Malian and Arab heart.
Terrorists in Beirut, Ankara, Sinai, Paris and Bamako
have sworn their determination to terrify us, as they
did in New York, Casablanca and Madrid. But they will
not succeed. Today, we have reacted rapidly, with unity,
resolve and strength. The only way not to cede victory
to terrorism is to pursue our way of life and to keep our
principles and values whole, making no concessions on
human rights.

I would therefore like to underscore paragraph
5 of resolution 2249 (2015), which ensures legal
coverage, as the paragraph stresses, in full compliance
with international human rights, and refugee and
humanitarian law. Because, as the Roman emperor
Marcus Aurelius said, "The best revenge is to not be like
your enemy". Those of us seated at this table have the
duty to guarantee those values and principles. We must
not allow our daily headlines to become a series of war
dispatches. No one can doubt that all of us - absolutely
all - must close ranks in order to combat and vanquish
terrorism.

I therefore thank France for its leadership on the
resolution adopted today and for blowing the whistle
that has brought us out of the trenches to intensify our
offensive. We have heard the Marseillaise sung often in
recent days. This is not the first time that this anthem
has symbolized resistance to the bloody flag oftyranny.
It is time once again for the Citizens of the entire world
to mobilize our battalions against those who have come
to slit our throats. It is time for victory.
