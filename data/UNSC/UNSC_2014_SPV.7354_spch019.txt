Mr. Nitzan (Israel): The Palestinians have found
every possible opportunity to avoid direct negotiations
with Israel. They have engaged in a never-ending string
of political games, and now they are parading into
the Council Chamber with a preposterous unilateral
proposal.

I have news for the Palestinians: you cannot agitate
and provoke your way to a State. I urge the Council
to stop indulging the Palestinians and to put an end to
their march of folly.
