Mr. De Hoop Scheffer: NATO will keep what we
call a residual presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
NATO will have a headquarters in Sarajevo to do what
you just indicated, Mr. President - that is, working
together on a continuous basis with the authorities of
Bosnia and Herzegovina on defence reform. I think I
can say that a lot of progress has been made on defence
reform. On the other hand, much remains to be done,
and NATO, I think - and that is also very much the
view of Bosnia and Herzegovina - is in a unique
position, given its experience, to continue to consult
with the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina and
to give good advice on the process of defence
restructuring and defence reform.

Apart from that responsibility, NATO will, of
course, given the importance of this subject, be
involved in seeing to it that the indicted war criminals
go to The Hague as soon as possible. We will do this,
of course, in close consultation with the European
Union, which is taking over the responsibility for the
operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
