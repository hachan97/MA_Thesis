The President (spoke in French): I thank the
representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran for the
kind words he addressed to me.

There are a number of speakers remaining on my
list. In view of the lateness of the hour, and with the
concurrence of the members of the Council, I intend to
suspend the meeting now. The Security Council will
continue its consideration of the item on its agenda this
afternoon at 3.30.

The meeting was suspended at 1.40pm.
