The President (spoke in Chinese): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of China.

China welcomes the Security Council's unanimous
adoption of resolution 2199 (2015), which is of great
significance for the coordination of the international
community's fight against terrorism and for supporting
efforts by the countries concerned to combat terrorist
organizations.

China opposes all forms of terrorism. We also
oppose double standards in fighting terrorism. And we
oppose linking terrorism with specific religions and
ethnicities. We hope that the international community
will comprehensively and fully implement resolution
2199 (2015), as well as resolutions 2170 (2014) and 2178
(2014), and jointly combat and contain terrorism.

China calls on the international community to
attach greater importance to the use of the Internet
by terrorist organizations in engaging in terrorist
activities. Pursuant to the relevant resolutions of
the Security Council, the international community
should enhance cooperation, implement policies in an
integrated manner and cut off all the channels through
which terrorist organizations use the Internet to
broadcast terrorist and violent videos, spread extremist
ideologies, recruit personnel, mobilize funds and
instigate, plan and carry out terrorist activities.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 10.20 am.
