The President: I thank Ms. Almasabi for her briefing, which I think has touched everybody. I now give the floor to those Council members who wish to make statements. May I remind colleagues that closed consultations will follow. We will also hear from Lieutenant General Guha, Head of the United Nations Mission to Support the Hudaydah Agreement, so let us be brief and to the point, maybe ask questions and look at the time.
