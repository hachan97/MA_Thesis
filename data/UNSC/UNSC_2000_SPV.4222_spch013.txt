Mr. Misran (Malaysia): My delegation is
grateful for the useful briefing by Under-Secretary-
General Guehenno on the partial results of the national
elections that were held in Bosnia and Herzegovina last
Saturday.

We have certainly followed the 11 November
elections very closely and with deep interest. We
commend the Bosnian people and the international
community, in particular the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), for the successful
conduct of the elections. That the elections were held
in a relatively free and fair manner, with the exception
of some irregularities mentioned by Under-Secretary-
General Guehenno, is a strong tribute to the
international community and the Bosnians themselves.
We look forward to the final and official outcome of
the elections, which we believe will have a very
significant impact on the peace implementation process
in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

We are hopeful that whoever is eventually elected
by the Bosnian people in these elections will be
committed to pursuing the peace process. We call upon
the elected leaders to work together among themselves
and with the international community to strengthen the
political, economic and social foundations for national
reintegration and reconciliation in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. This is the paramount and pivotal
responsibility that is expected of those leaders, under
the clear provisions of the Peace Agreement, and by
the international community, which is working hard to
bring about its full implementation.

At this juncture, we should like to say that we
share the serious concern about the illegal referendum
that was organized by the Croat nationalist party, the
Croatian Democratic Union. That referendum is clearly
illegal and represents a serious threat to the integrity of
the Peace Agreement. It should therefore be rejected by
the international community.
