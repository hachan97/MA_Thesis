Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I would like to say a few words to our
Ukrainian colleagues.

First, as he did in a previous statement, hinting
at Russia, the representative of Ukraine - just as the
representative of the United States did - mentioned
the Malaysia Airlines flight. Could he please tell the
Council why Ukraine has not published the transcripts
of the air traffic controllers' converstations? Could he
at least tell us if they have provided them to the Dutch
authorities.

Secondly, I should like to make a more substantial
comment - and I understand that perhaps in
Washington, DC, or in Brussels they might not know
about this, because for them it does not really matter
whether it is Ukraine or some country in Latin America
or Africa or wherever. But I am trying to understand.
When they announced the so-called Poroshenko peace
plan, which mentioned the need for insurgents to
capitulate, did the politicians in Kyiv not understand
the kind of consequences that could lead to? I do not
understand this. I mean: we know our region. We
know how close our ties are. That was an obvious step
towards escalation and disaster, which is what we are
seeing. Could they not understand that insurgents could
not simply lay down their weapons, give up and leave
for Russia and have Ukrainian tanks enter Luhansk and
Donetsk?

I do not understand. If someone had advised them to
do this, then that person either did not understand what
he was doing or was simply trying to provoke, trying
to completely destabilize the situation in Ukraine and
make life difficult for Russia. If the representative of
Ukraine could provide an explanation for this, I would
be very grateful.
