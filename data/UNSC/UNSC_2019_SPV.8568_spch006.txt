Ms. Goebel (Germany): Germany welcomes the
adoption of the extension of the mandate of the United
Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization
Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) for another year. I would
like to highlight four aspects of resolution 2480 (2019)
that are particularly important to us.

First, Germany welcomes that the primary
strategic priority for MINUSMA remains support to
the implementation of the Agreement on Peace and
Reconciliation in Mali.

Secondly, we support the fact that MINUSMA now
has a clear set of tasks in order to support the Malian
Government in confronting the crisis in the centre
of Mali.

Thirdly, we welcome the fact that the need for
operational support from MINUSMA to the Joint Force
of the Group of Five for the Sahel has been recognized.

Fourthly, we were very clear throughout
negotiations that the adverse effects of climate change
on the stability and security of Mali needed to be
explicitly referenced in the resolution. Those are key
challenges that the international community needs to
address collectively and urgently.

In conclusion, I would like to thank the French
delegation for its leadership in the negotiations. On
behalf of Germany, I would like to thank Ambassador
Delattre for the excellent cooperation between our
two countries, exemplified by our dual presidency
throughout March and April, and wish him all the best.
