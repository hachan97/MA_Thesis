Mr. Kumalo (South Africa): We supported
resolution 1843 (2008), which was just adopted,
because we, too, feel that the situation in the eastern
Congo, particularly around the city of Goma, is
deteriorating very fast. The humanitarian situation is
becoming more dire all the time. While we are pleased
with the increase in the number of peacekeepers who
will be sent to that part of the country, we wish to also
underline that it goes along with the political process,
which is also necessary.

We are pleased that the Secretary-General
appointed former President Obasanjo to assist in the
political process, and the good news is that the
infrastructure for such a political process is contained
in the Goma agreement and the Nairobi agreement,
which are both available to the parties in the area to
use to resolve the political situation.

We hope that the resolution will also act as an
encouragement, saying that we want more troops to go
in and assist people, but that it will also encourage the
political process.
