Mr. Safronkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We are grateful to the Permanent
Representative of Spain for the report about the
recent work of the Committee that he chairs. The
Russian Federation thanks the Spanish delegation for
its skilful leadership of that subsidiary body of the
Security Council at this very delicate stage. We hope
for a continuation of a business-like and constructive
cooperation in the framework of the Committee in the
interest of rapidly resolving the situation regarding
the Iranian nuclear programme through political and
diplomatic means.

We are continuing the search for compromise
approaches on the remaining outstanding issues in
the framework of negotiations of the group of six
international mediators with the Iranian representatives.
In that connection, we would like to note that it is
very important for all parties to ensure progress in
moving towards a final agreement. The key to the
successful completion of negotiations on developing
a final agreement on a comprehensive settlement of
the situation regarding the Iranian nuclear programme
is a precise and rigorous implementation of the basic
agreements that were reached at the meeting of foreign
ministers of the group of six and Iran at the beginning
of April in Lausanne.

There is no doubt that achieving an agreement
and implementing the expected arrangements will
go hand in hand with an in-depth revision of the
current sanctions regime. The discussion of concrete
parameters is currently under way in the framework of
the group of six plus Iran in Vienna. We will continue
to do everything expected ofus to resolve the questions
relating to the Iranian nuclear programme once and for
all, and the lifting of the sanctions against Teheran,
which were introduced in accordance with a Security
Council resolution.
