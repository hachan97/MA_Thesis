The President: In view of the lateness of the hour,
I would like to say in my national capacity that I will
forgo this opportunity to make a national statement. I will
defer it to a subsequent stage. But I will not let this
opportunity pass without first thanking Ambassador
Fowler for his presentation and the determination with
which he pursued the matter and which brings us to this
meeting and also to thank the Panel of Experts for its
very thorough work. We look forward to examining its
recommendations more thoroughly as we go back to the
sanctions Committee.

The second point that I would like to mention here
is that Bangladesh believes that in addition to their
inherent merit, the recommendations are also very
important and relevant and have serious implications for
the general issues relating to sanctions, with which the
Council is now seized, and the experts group which we
have recently set up will also look into the general issues.
I think the recommendations will have an important
purpose to serve when that experts group takes up its
responsibility.

I resume my function as the President of the
Council.

I should like to inform the Council that I have
received a letter from the representative of Uganda, in
which he requests to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Semakula
Kiwanuka (Uganda) took the seat reserved for him
at the side of the Council Chamber.

The President: I now have the great pleasure to call
on the Minister for External Relations of Angola,
Mr. Joao Bernardo de Miranda.
