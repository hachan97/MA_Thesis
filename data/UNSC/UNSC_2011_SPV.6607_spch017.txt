The President (spoke in Arabic): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of Lebanon.

I join my colleagues in expressing my gratitude
to Ambassador Nestor Osorio for his briefing on the
90-day report on the work of the Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1737 (2006). I
should like to make the following additional remarks.

First, we reiterate the importance of political and
diplomatic efforts to find a solution to the Iranian
nuclear question through negotiations. We support all
initiatives aimed at reactivating negotiations and
dialogue, which remain the best path towards a final
and comprehensive solution that encompasses all
outstanding questions regarding the peaceful nature of
Iran's nuclear programme, thus opening the way for the
development of productive and cooperative relations
with the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Secondly, we emphasize the need for a balanced
application of the three main pillars of the Treaty on
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT):
non-proliferation, disarmament and the peaceful use of
nuclear technology. We reaffirm the right of all States
parties to the NPT to develop, research, produce and
use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. We also call
for the issue of non-proliferation in the Middle East to
be addressed within an integrated and comprehensive
vision, without selectivity or double standards. Such a
vision should be based on the establishment of a
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East.

Thirdly, we believe that weapons of mass
destruction, especially nuclear weapons, cannot be a
source of security or stability anywhere in the world;
quite to the contrary, they constitute a motivation for
other States to seek possession of such weapons, thus
opening the door to an endless and destructive arms
race.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

I shall now give the floor to Ambassador Osorio
to respond to comments.
