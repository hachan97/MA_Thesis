The President: I thank Mr. Lacroix for the
clarifications he has provided.

Mr. Lacroix talked a bit about the challenges facing
women police, which was a question put to Ms. Mary
Gahonzire. I ask her to share her thoughts on that and
give her two or three minutes to do so.

I now give the floor to Ms. Gahonzire.
