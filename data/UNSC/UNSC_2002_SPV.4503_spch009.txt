Mr. Boubacar Diallo (Guinea) (spoke in French): My delegation welcomes the holding of this
emergency public meeting on the grave situation in the
Middle East, which the Secretary-General described in
his statement and which requires no elaboration.

The suicide attacks by certain Palestinian groups
and the attack by the Israeli army against the
headquarters of Chairman Arafat attest to the need for
urgent and coordinated action on the part of the
Security Council and for the unconditional
implementation of resolution 1397 (2002).

In this respect, the Council must, in exercising its
responsibilities, reaffirm its steadfast dedication to a
vision of a region in which two States - Palestine and
Israel - coexist side by side within recognized and
secure borders.

The question of security and that of a political
settlement of the conflict are, in our opinion,
indissociable. My delegation therefore asks Chairman
Arafat and Prime Minister Sharon to ensure that the
ceasefire is respected and to abide by the relevant
Security Council resolutions.

My delegation takes note of the adoption at the
Beirut Arab Summit of a peace plan for the settlement
of the Middle East situation in general. That plan is
based on the principle of land for peace and should, in
our opinion, facilitate a return to the negotiating table.

In this context, our delegation will spare no effort
in the process of enabling the Council to define the
elements of a common action that is commensurate
with the tremendous challenge that confronts us all.
