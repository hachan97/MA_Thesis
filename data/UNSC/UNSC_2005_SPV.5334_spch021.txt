Mr. Mwakawago: Since there were no questions
or queries that require a response on my part, I should
like publicly to thank you, Mr. President, and all the
members of the Council for having commended the
good work done by the United Nations Mission in
Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL). UNAMSIL's success is the
Council's success. Without the Council's support, we
would not have succeeded.

Finally, today is a historic day that saw the
adoption of the resolution on the Peacebuilding
Commission. The people of Sierra Leone are hopeful
that they will be worthy candidates in that respect, so
that peace can be sustained in that very beautiful
country. Those who have visited Sierra Leone know
that it is a fantastic country.
