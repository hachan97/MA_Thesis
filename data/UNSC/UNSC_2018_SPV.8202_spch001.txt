The President: In accordance with rule 37 of
the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite
the representative of the Sudan to participate in
this meeting.

In accordance with rule 39 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure, I invite Mr. Jeremiah
Kingsley Mamabolo, Joint Special Representative
for Darfur and Head of the African Union-United
Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, to participate in
this meeting.

Mr. Mamabolo is joining today's meeting via
video-teleconference from E1 Fasher.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2018/154, which contains the report of
the Secretary-General on the African Union-United
Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear
briefings by Mr. Mamabolo and Ambassador Joanna
Wronecka, Permanent Representative of Poland, in her
capacity as Chair of the Committee established pursuant
to resolution 1591 (2005), concerning the Sudan.

Recalling the Security Council's latest note 507 on
its working methods (S/2017/507), I wish to encourage
all participants, both members and non-members of the
Council, to deliver their statements in five minutes or
less. Note 507 also encourages briefers to be succinct and
to focus on key issues. Briefers are further encouraged
to limit initial remarks to 15 minutes or less.

I now give the floor to Mr. Mamabolo.
