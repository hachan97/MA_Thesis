Firstly, we would like to welcome the encouraging developments in terms of the security situation in north-west Syria, with the implementation of the ceasefire agreement between Russia and Turkey. We fully believe that this is a critical time to enhance dialogue and negotiations to resolve the long-standing political impasse in Syria to end years of conflict and bring sustainable peace to the Syrian population. We would like to express our continued support for the role of the Special Envoy in facilitating a durable political solution in accordance with international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, including resolution 2254 (2015). We strongly support the call by the Secretary-General and Mr. Pedersen for a ceasefire to give a chance for peace and to fight against the common enemy - that is, COVID-19. We remain concerned about the devastating impact of conflicts on the people in north-west Syria, as well as the continued shortage of basic needs across all sectors, including in north-east Syria. At a time of the unstoppable spread of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world, we share the primary concern of Council members about the potential of imminent impacts on the Syrian people. In that country, there are already enormous difficulties with health-care facilities, equipment, medicines, water and food supply, sanitation, etc. It is most serious in terms of capacity to respond to the spread of the pandemic in densely populated areas. The multitude of those threats cannot be dealt with given the current situation. We, therefore, very much welcome the swift and responsive actions taken by the World Health Organization, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and other humanitarian partners in assisting the Government of Syria. We urge all relevant parties to ensure prompt and unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance in all parts of Syria.
