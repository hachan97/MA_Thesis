Mr. Tanoh-Boutchoue (Cote d'Ivoire) (spoke in French): My delegation voted in favour of the draft
resolution initiated by the United States (S/2018/321)
for two main reasons.

With regard to the first reason, Cote d'Ivoire
believes that the draft resolution conforms to our
firm belief that any and all use of chemical weapons
in wartime as in peacetime must be condemned and
requires investigation to determine those responsible for
such acts to hold them accountable. In that regard, the
draft resolution submitted by the United States clearly
conveys the resolve of the international community
to see perpetrators of chemical attacks identified and
prosecuted so that they are accountable for their acts.

Concerning the second reason, Cote d'Ivoire
believes that the text of the draft resolution provides
guarantees with regard to the credibility of the outcome
of investigations. The text insulates such investigations
from any political influence and clears a path for the
experts' professionalism and independence and the
impartiality of the mechanism itself.

By voting in favour of the draft resolution, the
Ivorian delegation wanted to show its solidarity with
Syrian victims who are suffering from the consequences
of an endless war and to help meaningfully safeguard
international peace and security. Sadly, my delegation
notes that divisiveness within the Security Council
prevented the adoption of the American draft resolution,
which Cote d'Ivoire painfully regrets. It is time that
efforts be made to unify the Council if we want truly to
work to achieve international peace and security.
