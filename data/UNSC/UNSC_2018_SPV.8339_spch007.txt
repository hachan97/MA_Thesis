Ms. Wronecka (Poland): I should like to begin
by congratulating you, Madam, on your country's
assumption of the presidency for the month of
September. I wish you good luck and full success in
your endeavours. Allow me also to mention how much
we appreciated the efforts and professionalism of the
British presidency.

With regard to the work of the Council for this
month, we support your proposal this morning. We
welcome it and appreciate the fact that you are will
organize two main events, on corruption and security,
as well as others on peacekeeping.

Turning to the question of Nicaragua, Poland
appreciates the fact that the meeting will take place
under the agenda item "Cooperation between the United
Nations and regional and subregional organizations". I
concur with the remarks of my Peruvian colleague. It is
important that this discussion have added value.
