Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): Since January I have
had the honour of assuming the chair of the Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1540. I thank
Ambassador Heller of Mexico for his leadership of the
Committee in 2010.

In addition to the information just presented in
the joint report, I am very pleased to summarize the
main developments in the work of the 1540 Committee
since the lastjoint briefing, on 15 November 2010.

The Security Council unanimously adopted
resolution 1977 (2011) on 20 April 2011. The
resolution reaffirms resolution 1540 (2004), which
calls on all States to implement appropriate and
effective measures to address the risk that non-State
actors may acquire, develop, traffic in or use weapons
of mass destruction and their means of delivery.

Through resolution 1977 (2011), the Security
Council acknowledges the progress made by States in
implementing resolution 1540 (2004). The Council
further notes that the full implementation of resolution
1540 (2004) by all States is a long-term commitment
and task that will require continuous efforts at the
national, regional and international levels. The new
resolution extends the mandate of the 1540 Committee
for a period of 10 years, which will enhance the
Committee's ability to support the implementation of
resolution 1540 (2004) and to assist States in their
efforts, in particular by enabling the Committee to plan
its activities over a longer period.

The new resolution also provides for two
comprehensive reviews, one after five years and one
before the end of the mandate. These reviews will
provide the Committee with important opportunities
for assessment and to engage in an in-depth dialogue
with Member States on issues related to the
implementation of resolution 1540 (2004).

The mandate contained in resolution 1977 (2011)
provides the 1540 Committee with a sound and
efficient basis for its work over the next decade. The
resolution mandates the Committee to continue to
strengthen its role to facilitate the provision of
technical assistance and to enhance its cooperation
with relevant international, regional and subregional
organizations. The Committee is also mandated to
continue to refine its outreach efforts and to continue
to institute transparency measures, including through
regular open meetings with Member States.

The resolution further urges the Committee to
continue to engage actively with States to promote the
sharing of experience, lessons learned and effective

11-3390]
practices in the areas covered by resolution 1540
(2004) and to dialogue with States on implementation,
including through visits to States at their invitation.
The resolution also mandates the Committee to conduct
annual reviews of the implementation of resolution
1540 (2004) in order to guide its activities and, on that
basis, to include specific priorities in its annual
programme of work, as necessary.

Taking note of the 2009 comprehensive review
and building on the Committee's successive
programmes of work, the 1540 Committee conducted
the following activities since its previous briefing last
November (see S/PV.6424).

During the last six months, the Committee
received first reports on the implementation of
resolution 1540 (2004), and additional information
from five Member States. Using this and other
information, the Committee reviewed and approved
192 matrices before the end of 2010. The Committee
therefore continues to encourage States to provide
updated information on their implementation efforts.

The Committee continues to work on assistance
requests and on possible next steps. It continues to
elaborate policy guidelines to address a range of
assistance issues and strengthen its clearing-house and
match-making roles. Since the previous briefing, the
Committee has continued to raise awareness about the
revised procedures for processing assistance requests
and to encourage States to provide any updated
information regarding assistance requests submitted
earlier or offers of assistance, as well as updated
information on assistance points of contacts.

The Chairman of the 1540 Committee,
coordinators of its Working Groups and experts
participated in, inter alia, a meeting of 25 international
governmental, regional and subregional organizations
on cooperation in promoting the implementation of
resolution 1540 (2004) that was hosted by the
Government of Austria and in events related to
resolution 1540 (2004) organized by the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the
Organization of American States, the Organization for
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the World
Customs Organization.

The 1540 Committee and its group of experts
continued to participate in outreach to facilitate States'
implementation of resolution 1540 (2004). In addition
to those mentioned above, these events took place in
Central Asia, the Caucasus, Eastern Europe, the Middle
East, Latin America and the Pacific Islands region.
Thematically, a workshop in Japan addressed issues of
export controls, one in the United Arab Emirates
addressed trans-shipment, and one in France discussed
proliferation financing.

With regard to transparency, the Committee
posted on its website approximately 180 Committee-
approved country matrices, as well as Information
Notes on the outreach activities in which 1540
Committee members and experts have participated
during recent years.

I appreciated the cooperative spirit among the
Security Council members that led to adoption of
resolution 1977 (2011), and I look forward to
continuing working in that spirit in the implementation
of the resolution.
