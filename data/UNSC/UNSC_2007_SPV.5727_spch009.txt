Mr. Verbeke (Belgium) (spoke in French):
Belgium voted in favour of this resolution. We
welcome the adoption today of resolution 1769 (2007)
on the situation in Darfur. We are convinced that it
marks a decisive moment in the activities of our
Council in response to the crisis which has struck
Darfur. By mandating the first hybrid peacekeeping
force, this resolution is a strong moment of cooperation
between the United Nations and the African Union.
Given the importance of this moment, we welcome the
fact that the resolution passed unanimously. Belgium
would like to welcome the decisive role played by the
African Union and its members sitting on the Council.

However, our responsibility does not stop here.
By establishing the African Union/United Nations
hybrid operation in Darfur (UNAMID), by giving it a
robust mandate and an effective command structure,

the Security Council has added a crucial instrument,
both for protecting the civilian population at risk and
for seeking a solution to the present crisis, which can
happen only if all actors in a political process take
responsibility.

In that spirit, Belgium will continue in the
coming weeks and months to support the efforts of the
Secretary-General - whose presence here I
welcome - for the rapid implementation of the
support package for the African Union Mission in the
Sudan, and for the deployment of UNAMID, as well as
his political mediation efforts.
