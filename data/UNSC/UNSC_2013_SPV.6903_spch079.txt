Mr. Garcia Gonzalez (El Salvador) (spoke in Spanish): Mr. President, may I say how warmly my
delegation welcomes your initiative in convening this
open debate in the Security Council on the theme
"Peacekeepingin the United Nations: amultidimensional
approach". In today's world, this is key to understanding
not only the international context but also the scope
of the collective security endeavour undertaken by
the United Nations, through this principal organ, and
how countries that have moved from conflict towards
peacebuilding, such as El Salvador, can contribute to
such efforts.

We also align ourselves with the statement made
earlier by Ambassador Mootaz Ahmadein Khalil,
the Permanent Representative of the Arab Republic
of Egypt, speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned
Movement.

The High-Level Plenary Meeting of United Nations
heads of State and Government held in 2005 was a
major step forward for our Organization in terms of
its conception and strategic vision of the form, content
and deployment of peacekeeping operations, including
lessons learned on the ground from a series ofconflicts,
including the one in my country, El Salvador, through
the United Nations Mission in El Salvador.
That qualitative improvement was bolstered by the
decision to establish the Peacebuilding Commission,
a hybrid body in terms of composition, but one with
a very broad strategic vision that creates bridges
and communication channels within countries that
are emerging from conflict and are embarking on a
peacebuilding process, and subsequently, in a dynamic
and dialectical manner, focuses on development as
the only means of addressing the structural causes of
conflict and achieving sustainable development.

In a context of multipolarity, the varied crises
throughout the world, which have a negative impact
on the well-being of peoples and nations, such as the
international economic and financial crisis, which
began in 2008 and whose effects are clear in various
parts of the world; the environmental crisis, at whose
heart lie the devastating effects of climate change and
which is also contributing to increasing the vulnerability
of small countries; the political changes taking place
within medium- and high-income countries in various
parts of the world, which also have major geopolitical
and geostrategic implications at the global level; and
the global impact of phenomena such as international
migration and other complex issues related to the
unlawful trafficking and sale of drugs and arms, as well
as the impact of transnational organized crime 4 all
of these mean that the multidimensional approach to
peacekeeping is an extremely important tool in the
context of collective security.

Moreover, we should give thought to the necessity
and importance of moving forward with reform of
the Security Council. This is an extremely important
issue that ties in directly with the vision and the short-,
medium- and long-term strategic objectives that have
been defined for the deployment of peacekeeping
operations.

In our delegation's view, the time has come to
consider peacekeeping operations from a broad-
based, holistic angle that from the outset includes the
traditional components of peacekeeping operations,
but that is combined with a strategic mandate that
makes it possible to involve, insofar as the situation on
the ground allows, the components of peacebuilding
and sustainable development, including the gender
perspective and the empowerment of women, who
are essential to the achievement of stability, peace,
freedom and the development in countries emerging
from conflict.

Moreover, that vision should have an institutional
expression within the United Nations system, which
should be reflected in a greater interaction and
collaboration between the Security Council, the
Peacebuilding Commission, the General Assembly and
the agencies, funds and programmes for development.

Lastly, it is important to stress that the conceptual
evolution of peacekeeping operations, again from a
broad-based, holistic perspective, should contribute
to enhancing collective security in an increasingly
interconnected and interdependent world, for the
benefit of humankind.
