Mr. Makayat-Safouesse (Congo) (spoke in French): I would like, on behalf of my delegation, to
associate myself with the expressions of appreciation
that have been addressed to the President of the Special
Court for Sierra Leone, as well as to the Prosecutor.

The debate that has brought us together today
provides Congo with an opportunity to reaffirm its
ongoing commitment to the fight against impunity. It
can never be stressed enough that, in societies in
conflict, such as ours, justice lies at the very heart of
the objectives of national reconciliation, reconstruction
and development. Hence the importance that we accord
to the role being played and the work being done by
the Special Court for Sierra Leone. In organizing the
trial of Charles Taylor, the Court is serving the
objectives of peace and security, as set out in the
Charter, which form the very basis of the Security
Council's mission. Furthermore, the exercise of
international criminal justice will make it possible to
affirm that henceforth the perpetrators of crimes and
misdeeds will answer for their actions sooner or later.

It is on the basis of that conviction that my
country fully supports the work of the Special Court
and will, of course, provide it with all cooperation
necessary to enable it to fulfil its mandate. In this
respect, we would also like to associate ourselves with
the appeal made here to place at the disposal of the
Special Court the means it needs to carry out its
mandate.

In conclusion, I would like to say that we are
convinced that in the final analysis - above and
beyond the implementation of the Court's completion
strategy - the international community as a whole will
benefit from a legacy that could prove very useful for
the development of international criminal justice.
