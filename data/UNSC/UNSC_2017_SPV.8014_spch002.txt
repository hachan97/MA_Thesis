Mr. Aboulatta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): My
delegation voted in favour of resolution 2369 (2017). I
should like to make the following points.

First, Egypt reaffirms its principled position with
regard to the question of Cyprus. We call on all parties
to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Cyprus as an independent and fully sovereign State.
We commend the efforts of His Excellency President
Anastasiades, including his proposals to pursue
negotiations on a sound basis. We stress the great
importance of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force
in Cyprus and urge its continued role in maintaining
calm and creating a safe environment in Cyprus, while
at the same time ensuring communication between
the parties and seeking to relaunch negotiations. The
mission should also continue its role as mediator and
facilitator. We express our regret about the outcome
of the conference on Cyprus. We call for resuming
negotiations in order to achieve a just and comprehensive
settlement of this issue.

Secondly, Cyprus is a friendly neighbouring
country with which we have economic, political,
cultural and historical ties. We attach great importance
and attention to the question of Cyprus. We look forward
to achieving a just and comprehensive settlement of this
issue. We emphasize the need to uphold the principles
of transparency and inclusiveness by all members of the
Security Council in objectively negotiating all relevant
draft resolutions.

The meeting rose at 10.10 am.
