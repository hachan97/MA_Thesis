The President (spoke in Spanish): In accordance
with the concept note circulated for this open debate
(S/20lS/793, annex), I wish to remind all speakers to
limit their statements as follows: joint statements, up
to 10 minutes; national statements complementing
joint statements, 2 minutes; and national statements,
3 minutes. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing and
to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.

I would like to appeal to speakers to deliver their
statements at a normal speed so that interpretation may
be provided properly.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Thailand.
