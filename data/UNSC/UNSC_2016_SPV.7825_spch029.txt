Mr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): For the first time in the
Security Council, I was very glad to hear the Russian
Federation make a comparison between Syria and
Ukraine because that is the issue that we have tried to
raise here in the Council since we joined. The methods
used by the Russian Federation and its proxies in Donbas
are exactly the same as those being used in Syria. First
they intervene and then play the role of mediator.
