The President: As this is the first meeting of the
Security Council for the month of September, I should like
to take this opportunity to pay tribute, on behalf of the
Council, to His Excellency Mr. Martin Andjaba, Permanent
Representative of Namibia to the United Nations, for his
service as President of the Security Council for the month
of August 1999. I am sure I speak for all members of the
Security Council in expressing our deep appreciation to
Ambassador Andjaba for the great diplomatic skill with
which he conducted the Council's business last month.

Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.

Consideration of the draft report of the Security
Council to the General Assembly

The President: The Security Council will now
proceed to the consideration of its annual report to the
General Assembly, the draft of which has been prepared by
the Secretariat. Members of the Council have before them
the draft report of the Security Council to the General
Assembly for the period from 16 June 1998 to 15 June
1999, as circulated by the Assistant Secretary-General for
Political Affairs on 25 August 1999, and a corrigendum
thereto.

I should like to express appreciation to the Secretariat
for the work it has undertaken in preparing this factual
report.

I now call on the Officer-in-Charge of the Security
Council Affairs Division to make an explanatory statement.
