The President: I would now like to make a further
statement as the representative of the United States.

The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran
stated today that the recent terrorist attack at a mosque
in Chabahar, Iran, was "the result of the wrong policy
of deployment of military foreign forces in our region".
President Obama condemned the mosque attack after it
occurred and extended his condolences. The assertion
of the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran is
totally without foundation.
I now resume my function as President of the
Security Council.

I give the floor to Special Representative De
Mistura to respond to comments and questions raised.
