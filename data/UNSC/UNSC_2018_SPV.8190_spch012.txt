Mr. Van Oosterom (Netherlands): We regret that
draft resolution S/2018/156, submitted by the United
Kingdom, was not adopted. We voted in favour of
resolution 2402 (2018) because the sanctions regime
and the mandate of the Panel of Experts on Yemen
needed to be renewed. We strongly support the Panel
and the sanctions regime in question. We regret that
our concerns regarding non-compliance with the arms
embargo, violations of humanitarian law and problems
with humanitarian access are not adequately addressed
in the resolution that was adopted. We feel very
strongly that the Security Council should address the
humanitarian crisis as a separate Council product, and
we hope that a text to that effect can be finalized as
soon as possible.

Lastly, I would like to take this opportunity to call on
all the parties to work with the newly appointed United
Nations Envoy to achieve an inclusive political solution.
