Mr. Motoc (Romania): Allow me first to
acknowledge and welcome the presence at our meeting
of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan.

Romania voted in favour of this resolution.
Indeed, we share the widespread concern over the
continuing deterioration of the situation on the ground
in the Gaza Strip, including the large-scale demolition
of Palestinian homes and the death of a large number of
innocent civilians. That development was sadly
confirmed today by further reports of fresh Violence.

My delegation has already stated on several
occasions that, while fully recognizing the right of the
State of Israel to defend its citizens, all actions taken in
fighting terror must be in compliance with the relevant
norms of international law. We are satisfied that the
text just adopted reflects the parties' reciprocal
obligations in preventing the escalation of violence,
among which we believe the need for decisive action
against terrorism and the prevention of the illegal
transfer and acquisition of weapons in Gaza and the
West Bank figure prominently.

At this juncture, we encourage the two parties to
declare a ceasefire as a preface to the opening of direct
negotiations. As has been stated on previous occasions,
a just, comprehensive and lasting peace can be
achieved only through negotiations, as envisaged in the
road map, and in accordance with the provisions of the
relevant resolutions of the Security Council.
