Mr. Khare: I would like to begin by
communicating my sincerest thanks to all the speakers
for the very strong support expressed for the
observations contained in the report of the Secretary-
General, particularly that the present strength and
composition of UNMIT should be maintained while
awaiting the recommendations of the technical
assessment mission, which will be valuable in the
formulation of proposals for possible adjustments, to
be contained in the Secretary-General's next report, in
February 2010.

Several speakers also reiterated the Secretary-
General's recommendation regarding the need for
stronger civilian oversight of the F-FDTL and the
PNTL and for differentiation of their roles and
responsibilities. I wish to assure the Security Council
that the authorities of Timor-Leste are cognizant of
those requirements and that UNMIT - and indeed, the
entire United Nations family - will continue to assist
them in implementing those two recommendations.
I was also grateful for the strong support for the
Secretary-General's observation regarding the need to
strengthen the rule of law, promote greater
accountability and fight impunity. Again, I am pleased
to inform the Council that the authorities of Timor-
Leste are committed in that regard, and so is the United
Nations committed to supporting the efforts of Timor-
Leste to achieve a greater degree of accountability and
to strengthen the rule of law.

I was also delighted to note several indications of
continued bilateral and multilateral support for Timor-
Leste from all the Member States. I wish to assure the
Council that the United Nations will continue to work
with those bilateral and multilateral partners to ensure
that under the leadership of the Government and
authorities of Timor-Leste the people have the required
resources for success in socio-economic development,
security sector reform, strengthening the rule of law
and promoting democratic governance.

Finally, allow me to say how touched I have been
by the very kind words directed to my team and,
indeed, to myself.
