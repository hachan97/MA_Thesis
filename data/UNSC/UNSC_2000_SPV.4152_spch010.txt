Sir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): To
save the Council's beauty sleep at this late hour, on
behalf of the United Kingdom I will merely refer to all
our previous statements in the Council explaining our
actions in the no-fly zones, which set out clearly the
rationale and justification for those actions.

The United Kingdom has no request to make of
the Secretariat to examine any matters that are more a
matter of national positions than of the Council's
resolutions.
