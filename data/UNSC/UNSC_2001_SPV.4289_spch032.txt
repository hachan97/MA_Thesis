Mr. Goktiirk (Turkey): I shall be brief at this late
hour. It is a pleasure for us to see here the Foreign
Minister of Macedonia, a country that is a close friend
of Turkey.

We have already aligned ourselves with the
statement delivered by the Ambassador of Sweden. As
a neighbouring country and a close historical friend of
Macedonia, I took the liberty of taking the floor in
order to make a few additional comments.

Yesterday the Turkish Foreign Ministry issued a
statement deploring the recent violence in the Kosovo
section of Macedonia's northern border. Today the
Turkish President called his counterpart, President
Trajkovski, to express his sympathy for the loss of life
and to reassure his counterpart of Turkey's resolve to
support Macedonia's security and territorial integrity.
The Deputy Under-Secretary of the Turkish Foreign
Ministry will be on his way early tomorrow morning to
Skopje to have a first-hand view of the situation
evolving there and have extensive discussions with the
Macedonian authorities.

We stand by Macedonia in its hour of distress. We
stand resolutely against all acts of terrorism. We
likewise condemn the escalation of acts of violence
perpetrated by extremist elements on the northern
border of Macedonia. We have full respect for the
territorial integrity and the internationally recognized
borders of the Republic of Macedonia. We also support
the measures being taken by the Government of
Macedonia and by the international community, aimed
at arresting and remedying the situation.
