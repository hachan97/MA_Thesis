The President: There are no more speakers left
on my list. The Security Council has thus concluded
the present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

Before closing, I wish to pay tribute once again to
the members of the Security Council mission and the
mission of the Economic and Social Council for their
contributions to the promotion of peace and stability in
Haiti.

The meeting rose at 12.40 pm.
