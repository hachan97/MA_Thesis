The President: Today is a special morning because
we get to introduce our newest member of the Security
Council, Ethiopian Ambassador Amde. We are so excited
to have him. We welcome him to the Security Council
family. He should get to know these faces because he
will spend so much time with them that he will get tired
looking at them. But we are certainly excited to have
him, and we welcome him to the Council.
