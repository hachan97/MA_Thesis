Mr. Kuzmin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The eighteenth report of the International
Criminal Court (ICC) on this issue is extremely short
on information regarding the outcomes and dynamics
of the work of the Court on the investigation in Libya.
There is nothing to comment on. I should like simply
to reiterate the words with which the Prosecutor of the
ICC concluded her briefing today:

(spoke in English)

"It will soon be a decade since the Council referred
the situation in Libya to my Office. The people of
Libya deserve peace and stability."
