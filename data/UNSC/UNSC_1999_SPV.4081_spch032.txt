The President: I thank the representative of Algeria
for his kind words addressed to me. I believe that the role
of the chairmanship of the OAU, which is currently held
by Algeria, is absolutely crucial, and the constructive
leadership that it can give to making this relationship
better will be very valuable indeed.

 

The next speaker is the representative of Cameroon. I
invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make
his statement.
