The President: I would like to thank the
representative of Belarus for his statement. His
thoughtful comments on many issues on the Council's
agenda will be useful and will be taken into account.

There are a number of speakers remaining on my
list. With the concurrence of the members of the
Council, I intend to suspend the meeting now and to
resume it at 3 pm.

The meeting was suspended at 1.30pm.
