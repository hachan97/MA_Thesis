Mr. Temenov (Kazakhstan): First of all, we would
like to join you, Madam President, in commending
the British presidency for its exemplary stewardship
of the Council's work in August. The delegation of
Kazakhstan would like to congratulate the United States
on its assumption of the presidency of the Security
Council for the month of September, which will be
busy indeed, coinciding as it does with the opening of
start of the new session of the General Assembly and
the general debate.

We commend the United States for its well-
structured provisional programme of work for
September, with which we agree in general. However,
we would like to note our reservations regarding the
inclusion of the Nicaraguan issue in the provisional
programme of work.

Finally, Madam President, would like to wish you
and your able team every success during the month
of September.
