The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now proceed to the consideration of its
annual report to the General Assembly, the draft of
which has been prepared by the Secretariat.

Members of the Council have before them the
draft report of the Security Council to the General
Assembly for the period from 16 June 2001 to 31 July
2002, as circulated by the Assistant Secretary-General
for Political Affairs on 9 August 2002, and a
corrigendum thereto.

I should like to express appreciation to the
Secretariat for the work it has undertaken in preparing
this factual report.

As there is no list of speakers for this meeting, I
would invite Council members who wish to take the
floor to so indicate to the Secretariat as from now.

I shall now call on the Assistant Secretary-
General for Political Affairs to make an explanatory
statement.
