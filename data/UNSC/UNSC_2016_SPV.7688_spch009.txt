Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): I would
like to thank High Representative Inzko for his briefing.

Recently, thanks to the collective efforts of the
Government and the people ofBosnia and Herzegovina,
the country has generally maintained stability. Its
economy is improving and it has made some headway
with the political process and the rule of law. China
welcomes those positive developments. We respect
the country's sovereignty, independence, unity and
territorial integrity, and we believe that the people of
Bosnia and Herzegovina have the right to independently
determine their own path to development and their own
foreign policy. The international community should
respect the choices they have made for their future.
China hopes that the members of all the country's ethnic
groups will work actively to consolidate the positive
results that have been achieved in nation-building,
continue to fully implement the Dayton Peace Accords
and promote improvement throughout the country on
all fronts.

Bosnia and Herzegovina is an important country
in the Balkans. Maintaining peace, stability and
development there is in the common interests of the
entire international community, including all the other
countries of the region. Where Bosnia and Herzegovina
is concerned, the international community should adopt
a balanced and prudent approach that fully respects the
leadership and ownership of the people of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and should be committed to promoting
unity among all ethnic groups in the country, harmony,
sustainable economic and social development and
lasting stability.

China supports High Representative Inzko in his
efforts to fulfil his mandate and to work in a manner
that will enable him to continue to play a constructive
role in advancing the political process in Bosnia
and Herzegovina. China is ready to work with the
international community in continuing to contribute to
achieving lasting peace, stability and development in
the country.
