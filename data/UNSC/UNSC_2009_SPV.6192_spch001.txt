The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Brazil, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Amorim
(Brazil) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: On behalf of the Council, I
extend a warm welcome to His Excellency Mr. Celso
Luiz Nunes Amorim, Minister for Foreign Affairs of
Brazil.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in response to a letter dated 22 September
2009 from the Permanent Representative of Brazil to
the United Nations, contained in document S/2009/487.
I also wish to draw the attention of Council members
to a letter dated 23 September 2009 from the
Permanent Representative of Mexico to the United
Nations, which will be issued as document S/2009/49l.

At this meeting, the Council will hear a statement
by His Excellency Mr. Celso Luiz Nunes Amorim,
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Brazil. I now give him
the floor.
