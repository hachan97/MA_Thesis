The President: Before giving the floor to the
next speaker, I should like, in the spirit of Ambassador
Richard Holbrooke, to say a special word of welcome
to the seventh-grade class of the Convent of the Sacred
Heart - a class of which my daughter, Shelagh, is
proud to be a member. I hope that the presence of these
youthful spirits - the young ladies in the red blazers
in the public gallery 4 will serve as a good omen for
the future of East Timor.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is Mr. Jose
Ramos-Horta, member of the Transitional Cabinet of
East Timor responsible for foreign affairs, to whom the
Council has extended an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure. Your presence here, Mr.
Ramos-Horta, is itself historic. Until today, no
representative of East Timor had addressed the Council
since UNTAET was established. I am glad that the very
distinguished son of East Timor, a Nobel laureate, is
here to address us.

I give the floor to Mr. Ramos-Horta.
