Mr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I
shall be very brief. I do not believe there is a need to
respond to a person who does not represent a country
but instead represents an illegitimate Government.

What we would like to highlight - I think it is very
important, and several speakers have mentioned it - is
the issue of Venezuelan refugees and migrants. Many
countries in the region are making enormous efforts in
that regard. We in Peru host 750,000 migrants, whom
we have welcomed with our own resources. I mentioned
this issue a little more than a month ago (see S/PV.8476),
and Mr. Maduro's representative could not respond
to the question of why he did not mention this very
grave situation being lived by hundreds of thousands
of Venezuelans.

Also on that occasion, we listened with great
surprise how frivolously we were being told that the
situation in Venezuela was normal and that people were
preparing for the carnival festivities and to go to the
beach. And, once again today, we heard that the situation
is basically caused by sanctions - by foreign action.
As I said in my statement, the very grave humanitarian
and economic crisis is of internal making. For years,
like other countries, Peru has been receiving increasing
flows of refugees, which will grow even larger unless
there is a change in the situation. We can therefore in
no way accept that argument being used to confuse
global public opinion when it comes to a crisis that is
exclusively of internal making.
