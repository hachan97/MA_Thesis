Mr. Merimee (France) (interpretation from French):
The beginning of your presidency has already
demonstrated that the Council is in safe hands, Sir. We
are pleased, but not in the least surprised.

 

I should like to convey my delegation's gratitude for
the Rwandan presidency last month, which met all our
expectations.

My delegation welcomes the Council's decision to
extend the suspension of certain sanctions applicable to the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro),
which were adopted in September in resolution 943 (1994).
That resolution took account of a basic change that had
occurred in August, when the Belgrade authorities, which
had accepted the Contact Group's plan, decided to break off
political and economic relations with the Pale leadership.

Since then the authorities of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) have honoured their
commitment to close the border with the territories of the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under Serbian control
and have cooperated with the observer Mission of the
International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia (ICFY).
All the reports of the Co-Chairmen of the Steering
Committee of the Conference attest to this. My delegation
considers that the renewal of the suspension of certain
sanctions applicable to Belgrade is therefore perfectly
justified.

Following the conclusion of an agreement on the
general cessation of hostilities, it is important to give fresh
impetus to the process of negotiations on the basis of
acceptance of the Contact Group's plan as a starting point.
My delegation strongly encourages the authorities of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to
continue to honour their commitments, to further improve
their cooperation with the Mission of the International
Conference on the Former Yugoslavia and to continue to
support the plan and the action of the Contact Group in the
quest for a political solution in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
