The President: I thank Ambassador Oyarzun for
his briefing and for all of his leadership over the past
year on this issue. His enthusiasm and command of the
material, which makes all the difference for Chairs of
these Committees, is impressive, and we have learned
a lot.

I shall now give the floor to the members of the
Council.
