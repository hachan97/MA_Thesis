Mr. Dejammet (France) (interpretation from French):
Upon the announcement of the death of Mr. Francois
Mitterrand, former President of the French Republic, Mr.
Jacques Chirac, President of the French Republic, made the
following statement:

"President Francois Mitterrand passed away this
morning. I have just come from paying him my final
respects. I have also conveyed to his family my
condolences and those of the nation.

"For 14 years, Mr. Mitterrand wrote an important
page of the history of our country. He ensured the
smooth functioning of our institutions. He allowed the
democratic transfer of power to go forward calmly. He
tried to strengthen solidarity, and he resolutely
advanced the process of building Europe.
"Faced with illness, he showed exceptional
courage. Great was the man who has left us. It is
with great emotion and respect that I hail him."

I thank you, Mr. President, for having associated the
Council and all its members with this tribute.
