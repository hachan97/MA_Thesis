The President: I welcome Minister Meza-Cuadra
to the meeting. It is such a great pleasure to see him here
and to congratulate him, on behalf of my colleagues, on
his appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Peru.
At least there is hope for Permanent Representatives - if
they do their job very well, they are recognized and the
road ahead is bright. His appointment is an inspiration
to most Permanent Representatives. We will certainly
miss him, but he should know that he will be assigned
more responsibilities in his capital, Lima.
