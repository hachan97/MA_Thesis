The President (spoke in French): Before giving
the floor to Council members, I wish to recall the
understanding we have reached, namely that all
participants will limit their statements to no more than
seven minutes, in order to enable the Council to work
efficiently within its timetable.

I now call on His Excellency Mr. Joschka Fischer,
Vice-Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of
Germany.
