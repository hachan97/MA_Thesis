The President: I shall be presiding over this
meeting in informal style, as we did with the meeting
on East Timor on 6 April. The Council should be aware
that l have received a letter from the representative of
Yugoslavia, in which he asked to participate in this
morning's discussion, so I propose, with the consent of
the Council, to invite that representative to participate
in the discussion without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Sahovie
(Yugoslavia), took a seat at the Council table.

The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno, Under-
Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Guehenno to take a seat at the
Council table.

The Council will now begin its consideration of
the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting
in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.

This meeting will start with a briefing from the
Under-Secretary-General after his recent visit to the
region and will pursue an interactive style, whereby
members of the Council can, after the briefing, apply to
the presidency, as we often do in informal
consultations. If speakers raise questions, I may turn to
Mr. Guehenno during the course of the discussion so
that he can pick up questions as we go along.

I understand that some non-Council members
would like to speak. I shall invite them to come to the
table as they have applied.

I now give the floor to Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno,
Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations.
