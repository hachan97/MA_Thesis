Ms. Lucas (Luxembourg) (spoke in French): We
welcome the adoption ofresolution 2098 (2013), drafted
on France's initiative, barely one month following the
adoption of the Framework for Peace, Security and
Cooperation for the Democratic Republic of the Congo
and the Region.

The new mandate of the United Nations Organization
Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (MONUSCO) reflects the international
community's commitment to addressing the underlying
causes of the conflict in the eastern part of that country
and to bringing to an end to the recurring cycle of
violence. The strengthening of MONUSCO provided
for in the resolution will support the political process
put in place by the Framework Agreement. As the
Secretary- General has underscored, there is no military
solution to the problems affecting the eastern part of
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Great
Lakes region.

The protection of civilians must remain the main
pillar of the Mission's mandate. In that regard, we
welcome the provisions for the protection of children
and the fight against sexual violence.

The resolution we have just adopted entrusts
MONUSCO with a peace-enforcement mandate in order
to neutralize armed groups. The Intervention Brigade
to be part of MONUSCO will have a key role to play
in that regard. Moreover, MONUSCO should actively
support the Congolese authorities and coordinate
the efforts of the country's partners in reforming the
security sector, which is an issue to which we attach
great importance.

Lastly, we deem it important that MONUSCO
carry out the entire host of tasks entrusted to it by this
resolution in a comprehensive manner and by fully
exploiting its civilian, military and police capacities,
under the direction of the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General.
