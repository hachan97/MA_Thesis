Mr. Wang Xuexian (China) (interpretation from Chinese): The Chinese delegation voted in favour of the
draft resolution before the Council. The Chinese delegation
would like to register its regret and disappointment at the
result of the voting. It is fair to say that the requests
contained in the draft resolution were reasonable and
appropriate and that its language was moderate. If the draft
resolution had been adopted, it would have contributed
greatly to the peace process in the Middle East, not
damaged it.

Although the draft resolution was not adopted today,
the Government of Israel should understand that the fact
that there were 14 votes in favour of the draft resolution
forcefully demonstrates that its decision to confiscate land
in East Jerusalem is wrong and cannot be accepted by the
international community or the Security Council.
For the sake of the Middle East peace process and for
the sake of the fundamental interests of the peoples of the
Middle East, we once again appeal to the Government of
Israel to rescind forthwith its wrong decision. We sincerely
hope that the parties concerned will continue to promote the
Middle East peace process.
