Sir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): It is our
privilege to have you, Madam, in the chair of the Council
this afternoon.

Despite the efforts of the international community to
help find a settlement, the security forces of President
Milosevic are continuing to inflict brutality and repression
on those they claim to see as their fellow citizens. The so-
called Kosovo Liberation Army has contributed to the
present crisis. Terrorism in whatever guise and for whatever
end is unacceptable. But as the British Prime Minister said
in his speech to the General Assembly two days ago:

"Nothing can justify scorched earth tactics and

forcible creation of hundreds of thousands of

refugees".

This resolution, co-sponsored and strongly supported
by the United Kingdom, does three things. First, it calls
for an immediate ceasefire and for the two parties to
begin a political dialogue - the only route to a political
and lasting solution. Secondly, it sets out clearly President
Milosevic's obligations and commitments, including to
put an end to repression and to facilitate the return of
refugees. Thirdly, and most important, it makes clear that
the international community's patience is exhausted.

President Milosevic carries a direct responsibility. If
he ignores those obligations and continues to pursue
military repression, the international community will
respond and will respond vigorously. By acting under
Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and by
explicitly characterizing the deterioration of the situation
in Kosovo as a threat to peace and security in the region,
the Security Council is putting President Milosevic on
notice that he will be held accountable for his actions. He
would be wise to take heed.
