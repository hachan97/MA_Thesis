Mr. De Mistura: I have three brief points. First, I
thank Council members for all their comments. We
have taken due note of the comments, advice and
support offered by each member of the Security
Council and beyond.

Secondly, on behalf of all my 900-plus
colleagues, I also wish to thank all participants for
their very kind and warm words regarding the sacrifice
that my colleagues are making and the sad events that
took place in Mazar-e-Sharif. It does help.

Lastly, I believe that Ambassador Tanin and I will
bring back to Kabul a strong message of support and of
the consistent interest and engagement of the
international community in Afghanistan. I think that
that will help us during the difficult months ahead
leading up the Istanbul Conference and Bonn.
