The President: Let me comment, in my capacity as
President, on two very important points just made by the
representative of Tunisia. First, on a draft resolution: a
text is now beginning to be discussed among members of
the Security Council, in close consultation with
Ambassador Listre, and is circulating. As to the speed
with which we can adopt it, I know that many of the
African nations wanted it adopted in January; the speed
with which the draft resolution can be considered will be
determined by the specific reactions to it.

Secondly, the representative of Tunisia made a very
important point, which I should like to pick up, on
support for the Joint Military Commission (JMC) and for
former President Masire. I will be circulating a letter this
afternoon - as my final act in the presidency, I think -
bringing to the attention of Member States the unanimous
desire of the Security Council that Member States should
support those two missions. We already have
contributions of $2 million from the United States,
$500,000 from Japan and $1 million from Canada. It is
my hope that every member of the Security Council will
offer at least symbolic support, even if it is only $10,000
or $25,000. It is also my hope that other States, many of
whose representatives are here with us today, will, to the
extent that they can, contribute money so that we do not
repeat the lamentable sight that I personally saw in
Bosnia after the Dayton Peace Agreement, when the High
Representative, Carl Bildt - who was not responsible to
the United Nations but who otherwise had similar
responsibilities - had no money from anyone and was
operating out of his suitcase, using his personal cell
phone, for the first critical few weeks. It was very
lamentable; it hurt the implementation of Dayton. We
would not want the implementation of Lusaka to suffer in
the same way.
