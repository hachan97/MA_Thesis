Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): My
delegation would also like to thank Ambassador Takasu
for the detailed briefing that he presented to us on the
activities of the Security Council Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1737 (2006), and we
eagerly await the follow-up of the matters referred to.

My delegation is concerned about the points
raised in the most recent report of the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of 5 June 2009, which
states that Iran is continuing to not comply with
Security Council resolutions, to enrich uranium and to
build plants that are linked to heavy-water reactors.

As we pointed out previously, Mexico is in
favour of nuclear disarmament through effective and
progressive measures that will ensure the credibility
and effectiveness of the international system as it
pertains to nuclear non-proliferation. This is what we
continue to plan to do with determination. The positive
disarmament initiatives that we have witnessed
09-36921

recently on the part of some nuclear weapon States
contrast with the attitudes of other States that continue
to carry out activities that seem to be aimed at using
nuclear energy for non-peaceful purposes. We are
concerned about possible delays on the path towards a
world free from nuclear weapons. The potential for
nuclear arms to proliferate will therefore continue to
exist until such weapons are totally eliminated. What
does not exist cannot proliferate.

In that regard, we reiterate the importance of
continuing to address the Iranian nuclear issue through
dialogue, as well as the fact that it is important that
Iran continue to cooperate with the International
Atomic Energy Agency to clarify the relevant questions
concerning its nuclear programme in accordance with
the resolutions that have been adopted by the Security
Council.
