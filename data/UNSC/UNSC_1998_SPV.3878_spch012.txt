Mr. Dejammet (France) (interpretation from French): The Security Council, in resolutions 808 (1993)
and 827 (1993), entrusted the International Criminal
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia with the task of
trying persons charged with serious violations of
international humanitarian law committed in the territory
of the former Yugoslavia from 1 January 1991. The
members of the Tribunal have carried out that task in a
manner that we greatly admire and that justifies our
support of them.

Last January the President of the Tribunal requested
an increase in the number of judges so that a third Trial
Chamber could be established and trials could be carried
out within a reasonable time. France supported this
request as soon as it was submitted to the Security
Council. The increase in the number of judges had indeed
become necessary because of the growing number of
cases submitted to the Tribunal.

France is pleased that, following the adoption of
resolution 1165 (1998), which increased the number of
judges for the International Tribunal for Rwanda, there
has also been unanimity among the members of the
Council with regard to responding affirmatively to the
request made by the President of the Tribunal for the
Former Yugoslavia. We shall vote in favour of the draft
resolution.

The adoption of the draft resolution will show the
Council's resolve to give the Tribunal the resources it
needs so that it can continue its work for justice. We
welcome the efforts made to enhance its functioning and
its procedures. We are confident that it will continue
along this track.
