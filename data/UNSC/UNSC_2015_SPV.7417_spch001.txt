The President (spoke in French): In accordance with
rule 39 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure,
I invite Mr. Robert Serry, Special Coordinator for the
Middle East Peace Process and Personal Representative
of the Secretary-General, to participate in this meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda.

As this is Mr. Serry's last last briefing to the
Council in his capacity as Special Coordinator for the
Middle East Peace Process, I should like to take this
opportunity to warmly thank him for his outstanding
service. The Council extends its gratitude to him and
wishes him every success in his future endeavours.

I now give the floor to Ms. Serry.
