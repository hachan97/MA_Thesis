The President: I thank the representative of
Pakistan for his kind words addressed to me.

I still have a number of speakers remaining on my
list. In View of the lateness of the hour, with the
concurrence of the members of the Council, I intend to
suspend the meeting now.

The meeting was suspended at 1.35 pm.
