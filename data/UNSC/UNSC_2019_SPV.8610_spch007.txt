Mr. Zhang Dianbin (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution
2484 (2019), which demonstrates the Security Council's
overall recognition of the important support for the
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).
It is conducive to maintaining stability in southern
Lebanon and facilitates the further implementation of
resolution 1701 (2006).

China recognizes the important contribution
of UNIFIL in continuing to effectively implement
its mandate and maintaining overall calm in its area
of operations and regional stability. The Tripartite
Mechanism is a good example of conflict-resolution
through dialogue and consultation. We commend the
great dedication of the troop-contributing countries
and all peacekeeping personnel and hope that the safety
of those personnel can be effectively guaranteed.

Currently, there are escalating tensions in the
region, as well as frequent local conflicts. All parties
should effectively respect Lebanon's sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity. UNIFIL should
communicate and consult closely with the countries
concerned and focus on its core mandate by maintaining
stability in the area of the Blue Line. It should urge
Lebanon and Israel to adhere to the agreement on the
cessation of hostilities and actively help the Lebanese
Armed Forces to enhance its capacity-building and
increase its deployment across the country.

China welcomes the practical measures taken by
the Secretary-General to improve the effectiveness
and efficiency of UNIFIL and the Office of the United
Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon, particularly
regarding the management of UNIFIL's civilian
resources. We hope that he will continue to push
forward the process.
