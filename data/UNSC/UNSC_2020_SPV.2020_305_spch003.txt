for this opportunity to address the Council. I hope the Council will continue in future to invite other young representatives to brief it. In every country on the Council's agenda, there are young women and men who are working hard to build peace and who have important contributions to make to the Council discussions. I also wish to thank the United Nations Verification Mission in Colombia for promoting youth participation in peacebuilding efforts. I thank the Colombian Government for holding a national conversation focused on youth and look forward to seeing concrete results from those discussions. I am also grateful for the openness of the Agency for Reintegration and Normalization in working on different youth- related initiatives; through it, we have completed some very fine projects so far. As Council members know, the Secretary-General has called for a global ceasefire so that all of humankind can unite to fight the COVID-19 pandemic together. We should not have had to face a pandemic for the argument that weapons across the world need to be silenced so that we can focus on the greatest threats to our common survival, from climate change to transnational crime to poverty, to prevail. What happened in Colombia embodies this idea; the end of the conflict with the FARC-EP has allowed us to focus on the structural problems affecting our country. Young people all over the world look to the Security Council to live up to its responsibility to promote international peace and security. I urge Council members to see the COVID-19 pandemic as a reminder that we are stronger when we are united and that all of us have a responsibility to accomplish the first objective set forth in the Preamble of the Charter of the United Nations Charter, namely, "to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war", including mine.
