The President: I thank the Secretary-General for
his statement, which I believe starts this debate off
very effectively.

I now give the floor to the Special Adviser to the
Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide, and
the Director of the International Center for Transitional
Justice, Mr. Juan Mendez.
