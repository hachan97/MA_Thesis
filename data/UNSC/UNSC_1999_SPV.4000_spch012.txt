Mr. Rastam (Malaysia): The delegation of Malaysia
is shocked and distressed to have learned about the tragic
incident yesterday involving the loss of lives, injuries and
damage to property at the Embassy of the People's
Republic of China in Belgrade, apparently as a result of
the ongoing North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
air strikes.
We are deeply saddened that a diplomatic mission
has been hit and diplomatic personnel have become
victims. Malaysia wishes to extend its deepest sympathy
and condolences to the Government of China. We request
the Chinese delegation to convey these heartfelt
sentiments to the families of the victims and to those who
have been gravely affected by this tragic event. We take
note that NATO is investigating this incident. We await
the results.

The loss of civilian lives and injuries to civilians as
a result of the ongoing crisis remains a matter of serious
concern to us. Malaysia strongly deplores the
humanitarian catastrophe as a result of the continuing
crisis in Kosovo. As the crisis drags on, the humanitarian
situation has deteriorated further. The serious plight and
intolerable suffering of the refugees and internally
displaced persons have been well documented. They must
be able to return under secure conditions and with dignity.

It has always been my delegation's strong conviction
that an urgent political solution to the present crisis in
Kosovo must be found. We therefore welcome intensified
efforts aimed at reaching an early and comprehensive
political settlement of the crisis. In this regard, we believe
the Security Council should be able to exercise its
primary responsibility.
