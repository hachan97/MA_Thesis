The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as the representative of Poland.

To start with, I would like thank Special
Representative of the Secretary-General Mr. Ghassan
Salame for his very informative briefing on recent
developments in Libya. I also thank Ambassador Olof
Skoog for his helpful briefing on the ongoing work of
the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1970
(2011) concerning Libya.

Poland welcomes the high turnout in the recently
completed voter registration update. It is a testament
to Libya's eagerness to participate in free and fair
elections that will mark the end of the transitional
period. In that regard, we urge Libyan authorities to
finalize the necessary electoral legislation effectively.

Despite the significant decrease in civilian
casualties in recent months, we remain concerned
about the insecurity in various areas throughout Libya,
as well as the ongoing human rights violations and
abuses in detention centres and the cases of prolonged
arbitrary detention without due process. Poland also
supports the Security Council's undertaking of all
necessary measures against those responsible for human
trafficking, in accordance with Council resolution 1970
(2011). Echoing a recent statement (see S/PV.8250) by
the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court,
Ms. Fatou Bensouda, we call on the Libyan authorities
to fully cooperate with the Court in order to help bring
justice and accountability in Libya for crimes under
international law.

Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to
Special Representative Salame and the United Nations
personnel working in Libya for their dedication and
support for a peaceful end to the transitional period
in Libya.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Libya.
