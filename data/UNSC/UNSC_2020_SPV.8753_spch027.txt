Ms. Alsaidy: I am very grateful for all of the statements from the participants. If I am not mistaken, the question was whether we addressed the asks I mentioned to the parties to the conflict inside Yemen - and if so, what was the response when we faced them. Of the four asks we addressed to the Security Council, we addressed to them ask number three, namely, unimpeded access to aid for all people in need. That is the daily ask on which we engage with the parties to the conflict in different areas. Whenever we want to access people in need, that is one part of our daily work. However, we do that jointly with other non-governmental organizations, with the United Nations and with all humanitarian agencies. And we also do it bilaterally for our specific projects and activities. As to the rest of the asks - including discussions of war and peace - being a humanitarian worker and head of an international medical organization, we do not engage in such talks with parties to the conflict. We do not mix politics with aid efforts. However, whenever we have a chance to go out in public and speak about suffering in Yemen and what is needed to stop it, we do not hesitate to say it. The message is received by all parties, and they keep referring to that. I hope I have addressed the question. Perhaps my colleague Ms. Almasabi would like to add something.
