The President (spoke in Russian): I thank
Mr. Fedotov for his briefing.

On behalf of all the members of the Security
Council, I would like very warmly to welcome
Ambassador Tanin, Permanent Representative of
Afghanistan to the United Nations. This is the last
time he joins us in the Council in that capacity. We are
grateful to Ambassador Tanin for his cooperation with
the Security Council. We wish him every success in his
future endeavours. I now give him the floor.
