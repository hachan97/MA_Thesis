The President: I thank the representative of Viet
Nam for his kind words addressed to me.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is
Mr. Amadou Kebe, Permanent Observer for the
Organization of African Unity to the United Nations, to
whom the Council has extended an invitation under
rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure. I invite
him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his
statement.
