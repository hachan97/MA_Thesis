Ms. DiCarlo (United States of America): The
United States, too, is seriously concerned by the
escalation of violence in South Ossetia, Georgia. We

appeal to all parties involved in this quickly changing
situation to step back and to order their forces to
disengage. We can conceive of no circumstances that
warrant a continuation of the violence. We can accept
no excuses from any party that refuses to disengage,
and we assure all parties that we will value restraint
and condemn aggression.

My Government has been working closely with
the Russian Government in recent days in an attempt to
de-escalate this situation. We welcome the cooperation
of Tbilisi and Moscow earlier today in establishing a
ceasefire and setting up a direct meeting of Georgian
officials and South Ossetian representatives. We
condemn the South Ossetians' refusal to attend this
meeting or to honour the ceasefire.

We call on all parties to respect the territorial
integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Georgia.
We also call on Russia to pull its troops back and not to
inflame the situation by sending its forces to Georgia.
Russia must cease the transport of troops and
equipment through the Roki tunnel from Russia into
South Ossetia. In the days ahead it is essential that the
parties agree to measures to restore stability and to
rejuvenate the peace process.
