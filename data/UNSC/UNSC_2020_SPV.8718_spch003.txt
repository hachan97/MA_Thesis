Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): China always supports the peace process in the Darfur region of the Sudan. Resolution 2508 (2020), just adopted bythe Security Council, determines the regular review and adjustment criteria of the sanctions regime. China welcomes that decision and voted in favour of the resolution. The current situation in Darfur remains largely stable, and the region is in a critical period of transition from peacekeeping to peacebuilding. China applauds the efforts of the Government of the Sudan in maintaining peace and stability in the Darfur region and in promoting the political process. The Security Council and the international community should fully acknowledge the efforts made by the Government of the Sudan, respect the leadership of the Sudan on the question of Darfur, strengthen communication and coordination with the Government of the Sudan and carefully listen to its views and suggestions. China always believes that sanctions are not an end in themselves, but rather a means. They should always contribute to a political settlement of the relevant questions. The Security Council should review the latest developments in the situation on the ground, review its sanctions regimes on the Sudan, establish a road map for the lifting of the sanctions, send a positive signal to the country concerned and provide even greater assistance to the maintenance of peace and stability in the region, in concert with the Government of the Sudan.
