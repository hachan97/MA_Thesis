Mr. Qin Huasun (China) (interpretation from Chinese): The Chinese delegation is concerned about
developments in Albania and hopes that tranquillity and
stability will be restored in Albania as soon as possible.
We therefore support the political and diplomatic efforts

 

made by the international community towards the settlement
of the Albanian question.
The question of Albania is a complex one. In essence,
it is the internal affair of Albania. For the Security Council
to authorize action in a country because of strife resulting
from the internal affairs of that country is inconsistent with
the provisions of the United Nations Charter. This matter
should therefore be handled with extreme caution.
Moreover, we have never been in favour of the Security
Council frequently invoking Chapter VII of the Charter in
authorizing such actions.

At the same time, however, with due regard for the
relevant requests of the Albanian Government and for its
urgent desire for the return of stability to Albania as soon
as possible, the Chinese delegation will not stand in the
way of the adoption of the draft resolution.

In our view, the ultimate settlement of the Albanian
question depends on the Albanian people themselves. We
look forward to the restoration of stability and calm to
Albania at the earliest date.
