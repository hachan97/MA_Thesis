The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank Mr.
Ali Abbas, the Deputy Permanent Observer of the
League of Arab States to the United Nations, for his
kind words addressed to me.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Cuba. I invite him to take a seat at the
Council table and to make his statement.
