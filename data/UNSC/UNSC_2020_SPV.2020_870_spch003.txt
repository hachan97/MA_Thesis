France reaffirms its commitment to the fight against terrorism at a time when this threat, in particular that of foreign terrorist fighters, persists. Draft resolution S/2020/852, which the Council just voted on, provided concrete responses to address it. It would have allowed us to strengthen our collective efforts to ensure that members of terrorist groups responsible for crimes, particularly sexual crimes, were brought to justice. It gave special attention to the victims of terrorism. It was also aimed at strengthening efforts to provide a response, as well as prosecution, rehabilitation and reintegration efforts adapted to the profile of and threat posed by the individuals concerned. Finally, the text reaffirmed that the fight against terrorism, radicalization and violent extremism must be carried out in accordance with international human rights law, international humanitarian law and refugee law. France commends Indonesia's efforts, which made it possible to arrive at a balanced text, and regrets that this draft resolution could not be adopted. For the first time since the adoption of resolution 1373 (2001), on counter- terrorism, the consensus that prevailed in the work of the Security Council on counter-terrorism has been shaken. However, time should not be at the division. France will continue to work with its partners to ensure that the Security Council provides a strong and effective response to the threat posed by the terrorism for international peace and security.
