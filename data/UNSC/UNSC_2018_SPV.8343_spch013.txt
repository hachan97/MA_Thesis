Mrs. Cordova Soria (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): We have taken note of the
information provided today.

Bolivia reiterates its position of categorically
rejecting the use of chemical compounds as weapons,
since such use is an unjustifiable and criminal act
and a serious crime under international law and
undermines international peace and security. Their use
by whomever and in whatever circumstances is heinous
and constitutes a serious assault on human rights, the
perpetrators of which must be identified and brought
to justice.

This event sets a sensitive precedent, as it threatens
the non-proliferation regime and therefore runs contrary
to the provisions established by the Chemical Weapons
Convention. We reiterate the need for an independent,
transparent, objective, impartial and depoliticized
investigation in accordance with the current norms of
international law, mainly within the framework of the
provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention. We
reiterate the need for an independent investigation.

With regard to the March events, it is essential
that the countries concerned turn to the corresponding
diplomatic channels so as to comply with the principles
of mutual respect and bilateral cooperation, which
will enable a solution to this issue to be reached. In
that regard, making charges and accusations without
engaging in the necessary dialogue and transparent
exchange of information between the parties will not
contribute to that goal. Lastly, we call for dialogue and
respect to prevail as the situation develops.
