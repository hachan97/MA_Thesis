Mr. Bourgel (Israel): With regard to the statement
made by the representative of Iran, the firing of
surface-to-surface missiles by the Quds Force to Israel
from Syrian territory is evidence of Iran's intention
behind its entrenchment in Syria. Iran seeks for Syria,
like Lebanon, to be a launching pad for the products of
its missile programme, with Israel as the target. That is
the very programme that was prohibited by resolution
2231 (2015). It is indicative of Iran's imperialistic
and subversive enterprise that it is exporting missiles
and terror throughout the region, in Violation of
resolutions 1559 (2004), 1701 (2006) and 2216 (2015),
and proliferating its destructive revolutionary ideology.
Iranian missiles bear a chillingly unequivocal slogan,
"Death to Israel". Threatening the destruction of a State
Member of the United Nations is a blatant violation of
the very core of the Charter of the United Nations. It
jeopardizes global peace and security

With respect to the statement made by the
representative of Lebanon, let me stress once again
that Israel is not interested in escalation. But, as we
all know, the Iranian web of terrorism took deep root
in Lebanon. While Israel is dealing with an Iranian
transnational proxy of terror, whose very existence
is a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter,
the protective measures we take - the destruction of
Hizbullah's tunnels and the building of the security
barrier - are entirely on our side of the Blue Line.
The Government of Lebanon has a clear responsibility
to preserve calm and prevent Hizbullah's illegal and
destabilizing activities in Lebanon.

With regard to the statement made by the
representative of Syria, to the world's great dismay, the
Al-Assad regime, which has been terrorizing its own
people for a decade, is now offering itself as a platform
for Iranian terror. The international community should
unite in countering that element of terror.

The meeting rose at 4.40pm.
