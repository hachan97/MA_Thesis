Mr. Elmajerbi (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): At the
outset, I would like to congratulate you, Mr. President,
on assuming the presidency of the Security Council this
month. I wish you luck and success in your endeavours.
I would also like to thank the Russian Federation for
presiding over the Council during the past month.

I would like to express our thanks and appreciation
to Ms. Fatou Bensouda, Prosecutor of the International
Criminal Court, for her briefing on the twelfth report
on the situation in Libya. I would also like to commend
her efforts in carrying out her task in my country,
pursuant to the relevant Security Council resolution. In
that regard, I would like to stress that the Government
of National Accord will continue to cooperate with her
and with her Office, through the Libyan Prosecutor-
General's office, in order to put an end to impunity,
establish justice and protect civilians in Libya from
violations and crimes. Ms. Fatou Bensouda spoke
about the cooperation and coordination of the Libyan
Prosecutor-General's office with the national focal
point in her report.

In conclusion, we hope that the security situation
in Libya will improve in a way that would allow the
Prosecutor's Office to communicate directly with

the Libyan authorities so that it can pursue its work,
establish justice and ensure that the rule of law prevails

in my country.

The meeting rose at 4.45 pm.
