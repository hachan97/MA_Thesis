Mr. Oshima: I am pleased with the generally
positive way in which the Secretary-General's report
has been received by members of the Council and other
Permanent Representatives. I am also pleased to note
the clear desire on the part of many Council members
to move forward with the implementation of the
recommendations, as appropriate.

I wish to assure the Council that my Office, in
close consultation and partnership with members of the
Inter-Agency Standing Committee, in particular the
United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for
Refugees, the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights, the United Nations
Children's Fund, the World Food Programme, the
International Committee of the Red Cross and others,
looks forward to working with the Council for
implementation of the recommendations, following
appropriate practical mechanisms and procedures that I
expect will be put in place in the light of today's
discussions. It is my hope that the Secretary-General's
next report will illuminate real progress in this regard.

I wish to express appreciation and thanks to those
delegations that have expressed support for the work
done by United Nations humanitarian agencies,
including my Office. Regarding the specific conflict
situations mentioned by delegations, I am afraid the
time limits will not allow for an extensive response on
this occasion. I would, however, say that I listened
carefully to their views and, pleas, and in my capacity
as Emergency Relief Coordinator I will work to ensure,
again, in close collaboration with all humanitarian
agencies and organizations concerned, that the
humanitarian needs of those distressed civilian
populations will be addressed in the best way possible
in our daily activities on the ground.
