Mr. Traore (Guinea) (spoke in French): Guinea
welcomes the adoption of resolution 1483 (2003),
which in many respects constitutes a success for the
United Nations in general and for the Security Council
in particular. The Council has returned to consensus: its
golden rule. This resolution is a real source of
satisfaction for my delegation, as it responds to the
urgent humanitarian needs in Iraq, to which my country
attaches great importance.

During the discussions, our effort was inspired by
the abiding concern to stress the overriding interests of
the Iraqi people, who have already paid a heavy price
under the dictatorship and the sanctions regime. That
concern is reflected in the urgent need to recognize the
Iraqis' right to self-determination and control over their
country's natural resources. It should also be noted that
this resolution is proof of the Council's ability to
overcome differences and regain its unity, whatever the
crisis it faces. It certainly puts an end to questions
arising from the Iraqi crisis with respect to the
Council's credibility and effectiveness - in short, its
ability to best carry out its primary mission of ensuring
international peace and security.

Our vote in favour of resolution 1483 (2003)
means that we are in favour of the immediate lifting of
sanctions, which are no longer justified.

Finally, my delegation welcomes the important
role given to the United Nations in the rebuilding of
Iraq. We express the hope that the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General will fully play
his rightful role in this crucial phase for Iraq's future.
