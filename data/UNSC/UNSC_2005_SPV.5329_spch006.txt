Mr. Assaf (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): I would
like to begin by thanking the Security Council for
having adopted resolution 1644 (2005) unanimously.
The adoption by the Council of this resolution is proof
of the Council's commitment to helping Lebanon in the
very difficult circumstances in which our country finds
itself. This is in accordance with the Council's
responsibility for the maintenance of international
peace and security, in particular in the light of the
terrorist bombings that took place in Lebanon between
1 October 2004 - the date of the attempted
assassination of Minister Marwan Hamadeh - and the
time of the assassination of Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri, as well as other attacks, including the terrorist
bombing the day before yesterday that claimed the life
of Gibran Tueni, who was a Member of Parliament.

We thank the Security Council for its
commitment and assure it that the Lebanese people will
continue to steadfastly face all of the challenges and
dangers inherent in preserving the unity, stability and
independence of Lebanon. We will not turn back on
this path.
