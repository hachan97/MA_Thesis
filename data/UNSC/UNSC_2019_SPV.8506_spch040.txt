Ms. Page: With regard to the question regarding
the data, as I mentioned, we did some site visits,
we spoke to workers within and outside Venezuela
and also reviewed public data published by the Pan
American Health Organization and the World Health
Organization. Further details about our methodology
are published in the peer-reviewed article in The
Lancet that came out two weeks ago, for those who are
interested in reviewing that.

I also want to highlight that we in fact obtained
official data, when we could. To highlight one point, as I
mentioned, childhood mortality and maternal mortality
increased pretty significantly from 2015 to 2016. That
data comes from official reports from the Venezuelan
Ministry of Health, and that increase preceded the
economic sanctions were mentioned.
