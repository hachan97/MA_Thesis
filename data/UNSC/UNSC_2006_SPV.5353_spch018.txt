The President: I can assure you, Mr. Guterres,
that after 11 years of my life working with the Office
of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees, I shall continue to be one of you, and among
the refugees and for the refugee cause.

I want to thank you very much, Mr. Guterres, for
all the kind words you have addressed to my country,
as well as to individual countries of the membership of
the Council. More so, I want to thank you for the great
confidence you have expressed to the Security Council
in its past, present and future work, especially that
related to refugees. I also want to thank you very much
for the words of hope that you have conveyed from this
Chamber to all the refugees and internally displaced
persons around the world.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 12.15 p.m.
