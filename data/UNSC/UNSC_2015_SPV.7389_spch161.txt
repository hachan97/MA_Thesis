Mr. Heumann (Israel): Allow me to quote
Ecclesiastes 3:7: "There is a time for everything; a time
to be silent and a time to speak". When we gather to
discuss the values of the Charter of the United Nations,
there is no doubt that for some of the countries whose
representatives we have just heard take the floor, it is
time to be silent and, I would add, to reflect.

We have just witnessed a march of folly of the
worst human rights abusers, taking a seat at the
Security Council table and attacking my country. It is
truly absurd to hear representatives of those tyrannies
lecture the only democracy of the Middle East.

As we speak here, Iran is continuing to oppress its
own people, while helping other tyrants in the region
to slaughter theirs. Iran supplies sophisticated weapons
to Hamas, Hizbullah and other terrorist groups in the
region and around the world. It is always an interesting
experience when the representative of the greatest
State sponsor of terror speaks out on the maintenance
of peace and security. As we are witnessing the rise of
anti-Semitism and xenophobia, I cannot forget that Iran
is holding an official Holocaust-denial cartoon contest
this year.

We are all accustomed to the lip service of Saudi
Arabia, preaching about peace and human rights while
continuing to oppress women and deny them their basic
rights, from driving to voting and from receiving an
education to travelling alone in public. But I would
also like to end by awarding the representative of Saudi
Arabia a special prize, due to his creative intervention
that we heard earlier, in the category of Best Sound,
for his ability to tune out the public outcry due to
the official stoning and lashing of innocent citizens.
Congratulations.
