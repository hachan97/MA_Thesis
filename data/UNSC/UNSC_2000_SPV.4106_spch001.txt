The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General on the situation concerning
Western Sahara, document S/2000/ 131.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2000/ 149, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to document S/2000/ 148, letter dated 24
February 2000 from Morocco.

It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/2000/ 149) before it. If I hear no objection, I shall now
put the draft resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, China, France,
Jamaica, Malaysia, Mali, Namibia, Netherlands,
Russian Federation, Tunisia, Ukraine, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,

The President (spoke in Spanish): There were
15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1292 (2000).

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.
