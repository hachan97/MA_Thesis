The President (spoke in Russian): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Indonesia, Nepal and the
Philippines, in which they request to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Thayeb
(Indonesia), Mr. Sharma (Nepal) and Mr. Manalo
(Philippines) took the seats reserved for them at
the side of the Council Chamber.

The President (spoke in Russian): The next
speaker on my list is the representative of Algeria. I
invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to
make his statement.
