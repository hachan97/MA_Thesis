Ms. Blum (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): My
delegation does not seek to make an additional
statement or to alter the scope of this meeting. We have
taken note of the reference made to the information
presented by Colombia to the members of the Security
Council, and of the adjectives applied to it. The
information presented today by the Government of
Colombia is based neither on adjectives or baseless
qualifications, nor on mere rhetoric; it is based on
specific and verifiable facts. In my statement, I made
reference to some of these. I thank the President and
other members of the Council for the attention that
they have given to that information.
