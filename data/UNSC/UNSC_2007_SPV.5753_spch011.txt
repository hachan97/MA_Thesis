Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): We thank the
Secretary-General for his statement. We also thank
Professor Gambari, Special Envoy of the Secretary-
General, for his comprehensive briefing on his recent
visit to Myanmar.

South Africa supported the decision by the
Secretary-General to send Professor Gambari, his
Special Envoy, to Myanmar, acting in the context of his
good offices. We also welcomed the decision by the
Government of Myanmar to receive the Special Envoy,
and particularly to permit his visit to Ms. Aung San
Suu Kyi. We applaud Professor Gambari for his tireless
efforts since assuming his role as Special Envoy of the
Secretary-General and particularly his efforts aimed at
addressing the current developments in Myanmar.

The South African Government has expressed its
deep concern at the recent violence and excessive use
of force in Myanmar that led to the loss of life. South
Africa is of the view that the long-term solution to the
current challenges facing Myanmar lies in a negotiated,
inclusive and peaceful political solution through
dialogue between the Government and all political
actors. We call on the authorities in Myanmar to
exercise restraint and to refrain from further acts that
may exacerbate the current situation.

We welcome the expeditious and concerted
manner in which the Human Rights Council acted in
response to the situation. We urge the entire
international community, in particular the Security
Council, to rally behind the Secretary-General and his
Special Envoy as they continue with their endeavours.
