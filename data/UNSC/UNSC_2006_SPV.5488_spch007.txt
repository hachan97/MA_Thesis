Mr. Al-Qahtani (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): As is
well known to everyone, Qatar, in the light of its
responsibilities regarding towards the question of
Palestine, submitted a balanced draft resolution that
reflected the views of the majority of the Council. We
took into consideration the views and comments of all
Council members. However, the Council was
nonetheless unable to adopt that balanced draft
resolution due to reasons that have become clear to us.

Peace-loving countries will be able to judge the
objectivity of those reasons.

We have on numerous occasions failed to rise to
our responsibility to protect the Palestinian people,
who cry out for our support. When our response is
weak, it seems as if we are shirking our responsibilities
to protect civilian lives, notably those of helpless
women and children. The images of unarmed innocent
people being mercilessly killed and slaughtered will
forever be in our minds and in the minds of all peace-
loving peoples.

We should put an end to flagrant violations of
international humanitarian law. The failure of the
Security Council today to assume its responsibilities as
regards the deteriorating situation in the occupied
Palestinian territories and to put an end to aggression
will only encourage the aggressor and lengthen the
duration of the cycle of violence. The fact that the
Council is not taking action on such a deteriorating
situation will not only serve to exacerbate the situation,
it will also cast doubt on the ability of the Council to
implement international law.

Peace-loving peoples who are victims of war
continue to hope that the Security Council will assume
its full responsibilities and carry out its fundamental
mandate of maintaining international peace and
security. The day will come when the Council will
adopt decisive resolutions against the aggression and
violence to which the Palestinian people are being
subjected.
