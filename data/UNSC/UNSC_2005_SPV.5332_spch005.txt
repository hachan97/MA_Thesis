The President: I am not sure how one follows
that, but I would like to thank Ambassador Baja for his
inimitable briefing and especially for all the work he
has done on behalf of the Council in stewarding the
work of the two subcommittees.

I now give the floor to Ambassador Motoc,
Chairman of the Security Council Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1518 (2003) and of
the Security Council Committee established pursuant
to resolution 1540 (2004).
