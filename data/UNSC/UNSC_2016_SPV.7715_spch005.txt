Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese):
Preventing the flow of illicit weapons into Libya affects
the peace, security and stability of Libya and related
regions. China supports the internationalnternational
community in taking effective measures to implement
the provisions ofthe Council's resolutions as they relate
to the arms embargo in Libya and, in particular, in terms
of severing the channels and networks used by terrorist
organizations to smuggle and acquire weapons.

It is China's hope that countries will fully and
appropriately implement resolution 2292 (2016), comply
with the related principles of international law, and
respect the sovereignty, legitimate rights and interests
of flag States. The measures taken by countries in
implementing the resolution should not prejudice the
exclusive jurisdiction of the flag States over the related
vessels. The inspection of related vessels should be
undertaken only with the consent of the flag States and
in accordance with the resolution.

China hopes that the various Libyan parties will
resolve their differences as soon as possible through
negotiation, restore peace, security and stability to the
country, and combine their efforts in order to meet the
challenges in the security field.
