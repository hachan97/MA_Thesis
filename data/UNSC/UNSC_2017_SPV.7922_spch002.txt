Mr. Rycroft (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom is honoured to present, on behalf of our other
penholders - the United States and France - a draft
resolution condemning the events of 4 April in the Khan
Shaykhun area of southern Idlib in the Syrian Arab
Republic. The events in Khan Shaykhun were the worst
of human acts. They have dominated the international
agenda over the past eight days. The events of that day
and the manner in which the Victims suffered mean that
the Security Council must act.

Whenjudging how exactly to act, we must recall the
Council's determination in 2013, acting under Chapter
VII of the Charter of the United Nations and in multiple
resolutions since, to remove and destroy all chemical
weapons in Syria, and our subsequent agreements to
investigate any and all incidents of apparent further
use. We must also recall the Council's determination
that those responsible for chemical-weapons use must
be held accountable. It is with those determinations in
mind that we put forward today's draft resolution.

Our text condemns the events of 4 April in Idlib.
It expresses full support to the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) Fact-
finding Mission and the OPCW-United Nations
Joint Investigative Mechanism, already charged
with investigating this and all such incidents, and
it emphasizes the need for full access by those
investigators to relevant sites and recalls the obligations
of all parties in Syria to cooperate fully in that regard.
We believe that that is the necessary minimum response
required of the Council. We thank all Council members
that have helped to develop the draft over the past week.
We thank the United States as President for tabling the
text for a vote, and we urge all Council members to vote
in favour.
