The President: I will now make a statement in
my capacity as the representative of the Netherlands.

My delegation associates itself with the statement
of the European Union quoted earlier by the Permanent
Representative of France. The Netherlands expresses
its deep concern and intense sorrow about the latest
escalation of violence which we are discussing today.
We consider every life lost a tragedy. That is why we
want to see an immediate end to the violence on both
sides.

There can be no more palpable evidence of the
senselessness of the cycle of violence gripping the
region than the horrific bomb attack on innocent
children in a school bus and the collective punishment
for this act meted out against the Palestinian civilian
population. We call upon both parties to show courage,
not by fighting but by daring to break this vicious
cycle.

The international community should not fuel the
conflict by inflammatory statements or actions, but
should help both sides achieve a just peace that brings
real benefits to both peoples.

I acknowledge with appreciation all the
compliments addressed to the Dutch presidency for
having convened this meeting, but the Netherlands
delegation insists that activities of this Council must
not be allowed to interfere with the work done in the
context of Sharm el-Sheikh, both by the Secretary-
General and by the fact-finding commission.

I now resume my function as President of the
Council.
The next speaker is the representative of the
Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
