The President: I thank all three briefers for the
very valuable information they have given us.

In accordance with the prior understanding, I
shall now adjourn this meeting and convene a short
private meeting of the Security Council in order to give
Ambassador Braun an opportunity to provide the
Council with some additional information. I invite all
non-Council members, observers and media personnel
to leave the Chamber.

The meeting rose at 12.30 p.m.
