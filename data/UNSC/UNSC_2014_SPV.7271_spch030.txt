The President: Before we hear from other invited
speakers, I want to quickly offer a word.

It is well known that an essential requirement
of being engaged in diplomacy is patience. I want to
particularly thank all the Ministers who have come
here in response to the invitation today. They have
displayed extraordinary patience in sitting through the
meeting thus far, and there are many more speakers
to come. I think the importance of that fact makes its
own statement: that so many feel compelled to take
part and to express publicly their feelings about what
is happening in Iraq and Syria and the region and how
compelling it is that we all must act. I want to again
say thank you to all of my fellow Ministers who have
sat patiently thus far and who are participating through
this afternoon.

It is now my pleasure to give the floor to His
Excellency Mr. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Minister for
Foreign Affairs of Germany.
