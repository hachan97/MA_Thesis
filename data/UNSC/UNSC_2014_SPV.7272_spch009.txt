The President: I think I speak for the entire Council
in expressing our condolences regarding the loss of the
peacekeepers from Chad. Chad has made enormous
contributions to peacekeeping at considerable sacrifice
and it is greatly appreciated.

I now give the floor to Her Excellency Mrs. Dalia
Grybauskaite, President of the Republic of Lithuania.
