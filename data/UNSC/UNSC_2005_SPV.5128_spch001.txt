The President (spoke in French): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Kieran
Prendergast, Under-Secretary-General for Political
Affairs.

It is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations. At this
meeting, the Security Council will hear a briefing by
Mr. Kieran Prendergast. I now give him the floor.
