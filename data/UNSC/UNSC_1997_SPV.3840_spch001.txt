The President (interpretation from Spanish): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 3 of
resolution 1111 (1997), document S/1997/935, and
document S/1997/942, which contains the text of a letter
dated 2 December 1997 from the Chairman of the Security
Council Committee established by resolution 661 (1990)
concerning the situation between Iraq and Kuwait addressed
to the President of the Security Council. Members of the
Council also have before them document S/1997/951, which
contains the text of a draft resolution prepared in the course
of the Council's prior consultations.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless I hear any
objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call upon those members of the Council
who wish to make statements before the voting.
