Mr. McKenzie Smith (United Kingdom): I can
be brief, because I would associate myself and our
delegation with many of the points made by other
Council members this morning.

May I begin by joining others in thanking the
Minister for his very timely report this morning. The
United Kingdom welcomes the huge efforts that South
Africa has made in bringing Burundi to the very point of
achieving peace, and we would welcome the continued
commitment of South Africa, together with the
Governments of the United Republic of Tanzania and
Uganda, to that peace process, in particular to bringing
the Forces nationales de liberation (FNL) along the final
steps towards a lasting and durable peace.

Like others, we agree that the recent reshuffle in
the Government of Burundi offers an opportunity for a
new political dynamic. The opposition parties are now
part of the new consensus Government and, among
other commitments, have stated their willingness to help
bring the FNL back to the table. This is an opportunity
that should not be missed. Both the Government of
Burundi and the FNL need to be encouraged to iron out
their outstanding political differences, so that the peace
process can be launched. It is very clear - and the
Minister's briefing this morning reinforced the point -
that any kind of military solution would incur high
humanitarian and political costs and would be an
unacceptable step backward.

Lastly, we welcome the draft press statement
prepared by the delegation of France in consultation
with the delegation of South Africa.
