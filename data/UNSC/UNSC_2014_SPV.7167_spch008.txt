Ms. Lucas (Luxembourg) (spoke in French): I thank
the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs,
Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, for his briefing.

The situation in eastern Ukraine is deteriorating
in a worrying manner. Everything must be done so
that it does not degenerate into an open conflict with
incalculable consequences for international peace and
security.

We are deeply concerned by the actions of
pro-Russian militias separatists supported by Russia,
who are clearly trying to destabilize the east of Ukraine
and to prevent the holding of presidential elections on
25 May.

Faced with violations of its sovereignty and
territorial integrity for two months now, the Ukrainian
authorities have demonstrated restraint. They did not
respond militarily to the occupation or annexation
of Crimea by the Russian Federation. Until now,
the Ukrainian authorities have shown the greatest of
restraint in responding to the proliferation of cases of
illegal occupation ofpublic buildings by armed militias,
the growing number of attacks against Ukrainian
security forces and the surge in violence against those
demonstrating peacefully in favour of the unity of
Ukraine in the east of the country.

We deeply regret that the confrontations today near
Sloviansk and during the demonstrations in Odessa have
led to deaths and scores of injured, according to media
reports. We reiterate our call for the de-escalation of
tensions and for restraint on all sides, fully in keeping
with the joint statement adopted on 17 April in Geneva
by the chief diplomats of Ukraine, Russia, the United
States and the European Union. This is no time to tear
up that agreement, but to uphold it. The loss of human
life over the past few hours could have been avoided if
all parties involved had done the necessary to implement
the Geneva statement.

As we meet here, the situation on the ground
is chaotic. The presence throughout the territory of
Ukraine of impartial observers from the United Nations
and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) is crucial for establishing the facts
and defusing the war-mongering propaganda. Neutral
monitoring and reporting of the facts will help create
the conditions to de-escalate this dangerous situation.
The OSCE special monitoring mission must be able to
fully carry out its work to support the de-escalation
measures set out in the Geneva statement.

The safety of the international observers deployed
across Ukraine must be guaranteed by all of the
parties. We take this opportunity to reiterate our strong
condemnation of the kidnapping of a team of military
inspectors deployed under the OSCE 2011 Vienna
Document. We reiterate our call on Russia to continue
using all of its influence on the pro-Russian separatists
to free, unconditionally and without delay, the seven
monitors from OSCE participating States, whom they
have been detaining in Sloviansk for one week now, as
well as the Ukrainian personnel accompanying them.

Luxembourg continues to believe that a peaceful
way out of this crisis can be found. Nothing can replace
direct substantive dialogue between Kyiv and Moscow
to find a diplomatic solution to the Ukrainian crisis.
For that dialogue to take place, we must urgently
proceed to the de-escalation of tensions. We hope that
Mr. Feltman's upcoming visit to Moscow and Kyiv
will contribute to that. The good offices of the United
Nations are needed now more than ever.
