Mr. Omaish (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): Allow me
at the outset to extend to you, Madam President, and to
your team my delegation's gratitude and appreciation
for your excellent conduct of the work of the Council
this month, which has seen important international
developments with respect to various items on the
Council's agenda.

In addressing these wrap-up sessions, it has
been customary for my delegation to avoid extensive
consideration of the substantive issues before the
Council and to limit our intervention to the Council's
working methods. In that regard, we wish to commend
the manner in which the Council's work was conducted
this month, particularly in consultations. That format
has been effective and fruitful, despite the fact that
at times it has resulted in the extension of meetings
beyond the regular time frame.

Despite my statement concerning my delegation's
avoidance of current substantive matters before the
Council, the events taking place in East Jerusalem and
the escalation of actions on the part ofIsrael compels me
to reiterate that the Council must bear its responsibility
concerning those events with a View to putting an end to
the escalation in the Palestinian territories, particularly
in View of Israel's actions in Al-Haram Al-Sharif. We
thank the Council for its positive response to our call to
hold an emergency meeting yesterday on the issue (see S/PV.7291).

In conclusion, I would like to congratulate
the Australian delegation on its assumption of the
presidency next month and to wish it every success in
conducting the Council's work.
