The President (spoke in Spanish): If I may
say so, we seem to be having a small problem with
certain working methods of the Council because when
speakers take the floor in a language other than English
the English interpretation is so loud that we can hear
it in the Chamber. It therefore becomes very difficult
to appreciate the beautiful French of, for example,
the Permanent Representative of Chad. The experts
tell me that someone must have an iPhone or iPad
at maximum volume, making it audible to the entire
Chamber. Therefore, while we attempt to fix this little
problem of the Council's working methods, I would ask
all members to check their electronic and computer
devices.
