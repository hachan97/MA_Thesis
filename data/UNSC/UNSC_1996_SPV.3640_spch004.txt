The President: It is my understanding that the
Council is ready to proceed to vote on the draft resolution
before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council who
wish to make statements before the voting.
