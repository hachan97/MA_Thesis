The President: I thank the Special Representative of
the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict
for his kind words addressed to me and to Security
Council members.

I should like to inform the Council that I have
received letters from the representatives of El Salvador,
Latvia, Romania and Ukraine, in which they request to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice,
I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional
rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Castaneda-
Cornejo (El Salvador), Mr. Priedkalns (Latvia), Mr.
Gorita (Romania) and Mr. Yel'chenko (Ukraine)
took the seats reserved for them at the side of the
Council Chamber.
