Mr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): We
welcome the Council's adoption today of resolution 2476
(2019), requesting the Secretary-General to establish
the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH)
for an initial period of 12 months starting on 16 October,
in line with the Secretary-General's recommendations
and the priorities and expectations of the Government
of Haiti. Peru is firmly committed to stability and
development in Haiti, and we have confidence in the
important role that BINUH will play in supporting
the efforts of the Haitian Government during this
transitional period, particularly in strengthening and
promoting political dialogue, the rule of law, human
rights and the fight against gangs and corruption.

While we thank the delegation of the United
States for its efforts to achieve a robust text, we would
nevertheless like to day that we would have liked
the resolution to include references to Haiti's high
vulnerability to the effects of climate change, as well as
to the role of the Peacebuilding Fund and the Economic
and Social Council Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti,
which we believe are in a position to make a coordinated
contribution to BINUH's work. Peru will continue to be
committed to the people and the Government of Haiti
and to contributing, together with the United Nations
and the international community, to their efforts to
achieve sustainable peace in our brother country.
