Mr. Azubalis: I sincerely thank all Council
members for their unanimous support for our
chairmanship programme. It is obvious that the
consolidated political will of all nations concerned can
move things along. I hope that the supportive
statements made here today will be reflected in strong
political will that will lead to concrete actions and help
us to implement our programme.
