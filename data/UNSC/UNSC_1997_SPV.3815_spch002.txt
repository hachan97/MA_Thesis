Mr. Fall (Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs) (interpretation from French): The draft annual
report of the Security Council for the period 16 June 1996
to 15 June 1997, to be submitted to the General Assembly
of the United Nations in pursuance of paragraph 3 of
Article 24 and paragraph 1 of Article 15 of the United
Nations Charter, has been prepared by the Secretariat in
line with the revised format agreed upon by the Security
Council in 1974 and further revised in 1985, 1993 and
1994 and 1995.

The present format of the draft report before the
Council provides a guide to the activities of the Council
in a concise manner. As requested by the Security
Council, it contains in its introduction more information
about the work of each of the Sanctions Committees than
has previously been done. It also lists the meetings of
troop-contributing countries chaired by the President of
the Security Council during the period under review.

The draft report was circulated by the Assistant
Secretary- General for Political Affairs on 27 August
1997 to the current members of the Security Council and
also to the respective members whose terms of office
expired on 31 December 1996 - that is, Botswana,
Germany, Honduras, Indonesia and Italy - for review
and comments, if any. Corrigenda containing changes
proposed by Council members and by the Secretariat have
also been circulated to Council members.
