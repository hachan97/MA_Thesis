The President (spoke in Arabic): Before giving
the floor to the next speaker inscribed on my list, I
should like to point out that during today's debate, I
intend to give the floor to speakers in the following
manner: two Council members will be given the floor
in alternation with three United Nations Member
States. Therefore, the next speaker on my list, from
among the Council members, is the representative of
Norway.
