The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Ms. Hoppe for her briefing.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I should like to remind all
speakers to limit their statements to no more than five
minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its
work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy
statements are kindly requested to circulate the texts in
writing and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking in the Chamber.

On behalf of the Security Council, I extend a
warm welcome to our friend Mr. Oscar Maurtua,
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Peru.
