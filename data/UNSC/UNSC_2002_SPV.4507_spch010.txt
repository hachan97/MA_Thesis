The President (spake in Russian): As we agreed,
I will now suspend the meeting and we will resume at
3 p.m. This will allow the other members of the
Security Council to take the floor and, above all,
enable Ms. Bertini to make her concluding remarks and
respond to the questions and comments that she will
have heard.

The meeting was suspended at 12.50 p.m.
