Mr. Zagaynov (spoke in Russian): Given that it is
quite late, I will be very brief.

I would like to thank the representative of Ukraine
for his lecture on current international relations, but
he need not worry - we understand English as well. I
would also like to point out that what he said has no link
whatsoever with the topic of today's discussion.
