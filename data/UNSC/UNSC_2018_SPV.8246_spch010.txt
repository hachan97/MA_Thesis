Mrs. Mele Colifa (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in Spanish): We thank and commend the Personal Envoy
of the Secretary-General for Western Sahara, Mr. Horst
Kohler, for his efforts. We also thank the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General for Western
Sahara, Mr. Colin Stewart.
The Republic of Equatorial Guinea, which
always advocates the peaceful resolution of conflicts,
wholeheartedly welcomes the renewal of the mandate
of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in
Western Sahara (MINURSO). We voted in favour of
resolution 2414 (2018) because we understand that
the provisions of this new resolution commit all the
parties to continue advancing towards a political
process that has stagnated for quite some time without
significant progress.

The text seeks the adoption of measures to guarantee
peace and security in the region, while demanding
total and unconditional respect for all agreements
reached with MINURSO under the auspices of the
Secretary-General, whose tireless efforts in the search
for an acceptable and mutually beneficial solution we
commend. We call on the international community to
resolutely support those efforts.

We take this opportunity to acknowledge the
efforts and sacrifices of the parties involved in the
conflict, which has raged for decades on the African
continent, with a view to reaching a definitive and
mutually satisfactory solution as soon as possible in
order to finally bring the Saharan people the peace they
yearn for and stability to the subregion.

Equatorial Guinea also voted in favour because it is
convinced that the initiatives under way can lead to the
desired resolution of the conflict.
