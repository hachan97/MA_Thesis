The President: I thank Mr. Brammertz for his
clarifications and comments.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

May I take this opportunity, on behalf of the
Security Council, to thank Judge Pocar, Judge Byron,
Prosecutor Brammertz and Prosecutor Jallow for taking
the time to brief the Council.

The meeting rose at 1.15pm.
