Mr. Richmond (United Kingdom): I should like to
begin by extending the British Government's condolences
to King Mohamed VI and his family and to the
Government and people of Morocco on the death of King
Hassan II. I should like to take this opportunity to pay
tribute to his many achievements, notably his tireless efforts
to promote peace in the Middle East.

I would also like to thank Mrs. Ogata for an extremely
helpful briefing. It is right that we are reminded of the
number and the scale of the refugee problems in Africa,
and of what is expected of this Council and the
international community as a whole. The recent crisis in
Kosovo has not altered in any way the British
Government's determination to assist with the problems of
Africa. Our bilateral funding commitments to Africa remain
strong, and our regular contributions to the Office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR), most recently $10.5 million last March, are
largely unearmarked, so allocation is a matter for UNHCR.

In light of the agreements signed in Lome and
Lusaka - which, as Mrs. Ogata has pointed out, are a real
opportunity to bring those long-standing conflicts to an
end - I have one or two questions which I would like to
raise.

First of all, does UNHCR already have plans in place
to assist the refugees currently in Guinea and elsewhere to
return home to Sierra Leone? Has the process already
begun, or, if not, what are the main conditions which need
to be fulfilled before refugee return can begin?

Second, the news that UNHCR has resumed the
repatriation of Rwandan refugees is extremely welcome, but
I would like to ask whether UNHCR anticipates problems
over screening for ex-FAR and interahamwe, and if so,
what arrangements are in place to deal with this problem.
