The President (spoke in French): I now put to
the vote the draft resolution contained in document
S/2004/240.

A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Algeria, Angola, Benin, Brazil, Chile, China,
France, Pakistan, Philippines, Russian Federation,
Spain

Against:
United States of America

Abstaining:
Germany, Romania, United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland

The President (spoke in French): The result of
the voting is as follows: 11 in favour, one against and
three abstentions. The draft resolution has not been
adopted, owing to the negative vote of a permanent
member of the Security Council.

I shall now call on those representatives who
wish to make statements following the voting.
