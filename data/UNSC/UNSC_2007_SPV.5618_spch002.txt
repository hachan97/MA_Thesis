Mr. Burian (Slovakia): I have the honour to brief
the Security Council on the activities of the Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1718 (2006), of
14 October 2006, concerning the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, for the period 14 October 2006 to
11 January 2007, in accordance with operative
paragraph 12 (g) of resolution 1718 (2006).

Following consultations among the members of
the Security Council held on 20 October 2006, the
Council agreed to elect the Bureau of the Committee
for 2006, which consisted of the Permanent
Representative of Slovakia to the United Nations as
Chairman and the delegations of Argentina and Qatar
providing the two Vice-Chairmen. The Committee
started its full operations by holding its first informal
meeting on 23 October 2006.

Since its inception, the Committee has been
meeting with such frequency as necessary to carry out
its duties effectively, and it is expected that it will meet
regularly, once a week. During the reporting period, the
Committee held nine informal meetings at the expert
level. In discharging its mandate, the Committee was
guided by paragraph 12 of resolution 1718 (2006).

By operative paragraph 8 (a) (ii) of resolution
1718 (2006), the Security Council decided that all
Member States shall prevent the direct or indirect
supply, sale or transfer to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea of items, materials, equipment,
goods and technology covered by documents
2

S/2006/814 and S/2006/815, unless within 14 days of
the adoption of resolution 1718 (2006) the Committee
had amended or completed their provisions also taking
into account the list contained in document
S/2006/816, circulated on 12 October by the Permanent
Representative of France to the United Nations.

On 1 November 2006, I informed all United
Nations Member States in a note verbale that, pursuant
to resolution 1718 (2006), the Committee had revised
the chemical and biological programmes list, and that a
new document - S/2006/853 - now superseded
document S/2006/816. The lists of items, materials,
equipment, goods and technology listed in documents
S/2006/814 and S/2006/815 remained unchanged.
Documents S/2006/814, S/2006/815 and S/2006/853
and S/2006/853/Corr.1 may also be accessed on the
Committee's web site.

In accordance with its mandate, the Committee is
continuing the process of determining additional items,
materials, equipment, goods and technology to be
specified for the purpose of paragraph 8 (a) (ii) of the
resolution, as the members of the Committee have
submitted further amendments to the lists in documents
S/2006/814, S/2006/815 and S/2006/853.

Paragraph 11 of resolution 1718 (2006) calls
upon all States Members of the United Nations to
report to the Security Council within 30 days of the
adoption of the resolution on the steps that they have
taken with a view to implementing effectively the
provisions of paragraph 8 of the resolution. As of 10
January 2007, the Committee had received replies from
46 countries and one organization - the European
Union - to its note verbale of 1 November 2006
concerning the implementation of resolution 1718
(2006). Replies are being issued as official documents
of the United Nations and are accessible electronically
through the United Nations Official Documents System
and on the Committee web site, unless a State requests
that its reply be kept confidential.

Resolution 1718 (2006) tasked the Committee to
seek information regarding the actions taken to
implement effectively the relevant measures imposed
by it, in particular from those States that are producing
or possessing the items proscribed in paragraph 8 (a).
However, inasmuch as this is a direct and binding
requirement of the resolution, all States, irrespective of
whether they possess a potential associated with
weapons of mass destruction and their means of
07-20648
delivery and related materials covered by resolution
1718 (2006), are called upon to report to the Security
Council Committee on the steps that they have taken
nationally to implement the resolution.

The Committee is currently considering draft
guidelines for the conduct of its work. This document
will be a tool to facilitate the implementation of the
measures imposed by the resolution.

While affirming that the primary responsibility
for implementing the provisions of resolution 1718
(2006) rests with States, the Committee stands ready to
facilitate, when requested, the implementation of those
measures. The Committee started its proactive
approach in this area when it received letters from the
International Air Transport Association and from the
Permanent Mission of Ukraine to the United Nations,
dated 27 October 2006 and 3 November 2006
respectively, seeking guidance on or providing
notification of a specific case of cooperation with the
Government of the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea after the adoption of resolution 1718 (2006).
The Committee will continue this cooperation with
Member States and relevant organizations upon
receiving specific requests in this regard.

Owing to keen interest from Member States
outside the Council, as well as from many of those
represented on the Council, the Committee has
addressed the issue of implementing paragraph
8 (a) (iii) of resolution 1718 (2006) concerning the ban
on the export of luxury goods to the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea. In this connection, the
Committee considered that any definition of luxury
goods as may be necessary for Member States to
implement that provision of the resolution would be
the national responsibility of individual Member
States.

The Committee also reaffirmed that the measures
contained in paragraph 8 (a) (iii) of resolution 1718
(2006) are not intended to restrict the supply of
ordinary goods to the wider population of the country
or to have a negative humanitarian impact on the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The
Committee referred Member States to national reports
submitted pursuant to operative paragraph 11 of the
resolution as cases of national definitions and
implementation with respect to luxury goods.

In paragraph 12 (e) of resolution 1718 (2006), the
Security Council decided to give a mandate to the
07-20648

Committee to designate additional individuals and
entities subject to the measures imposed by paragraphs
8 (d) and 8 (e) of the resolution - targeted financial
sanctions and a travel ban, respectively. I wish to
inform the Council that during the reporting period the
Committee has received no requests for designation on
the basis of the criteria contained in those two
sub-paragraphs.
