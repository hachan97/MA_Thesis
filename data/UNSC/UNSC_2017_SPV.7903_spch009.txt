The President: I would like to thank warmly all
of our briefers, in particular Monseigneur Utembi
and Ms. Kalala for travelling to New York to brief the
Security Council. Their briefings have provided us
with an invaluable insight at an important moment for
their country.

I now invite Council members to informal
consultations to continue our discussion on the subject.

The meeting rose at 12.05 pm.
