Mr. Sy (spoke in French): I do not think that I
have a great deal to say following the very detailed and
relevant statements made by the various members of
the Council and their guests. I would merely like to
underscore - as you yourself did very aptly,
Mr. President - that this is a critical peace-building
phase in a subregional context characterized by a high
level oftension.

Even if solutions were to be found to the
domestic problems of the Central African Republic,
this might not be enough to guarantee peace and
stability in that country. A comprehensive approach
must therefore be considered. In this connection,
Minister Amara Essy's mission and the very relevant
conclusions he has reached could help us to consolidate
the necessary components of a subregional solution.

As concerns the internal problems of the Central
African Republic, I think that today we can say that
headway is being made. There has been progress in
terms of the promotion and respect of human rights,
and the partners are beginning to understand the scope
of the crisis and realizing that they have to be more
flexible in their interventions. I am thinking in
particular of the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund, but also of the Central African
Republic's bilateral partners. I think that there are
grounds for hope.

I will leave this meeting with a degree of
optimism based in part on the very insightful
statements made by the members. I was very struck
also by the attentiveness with which they read the
Secretary-General's report, by the relevance of their
comments and by the richness oftheir contributions.

I thank the Council for its support, and I hope that
we in the United Nations Peace-building Support
Office in the Central African Republic (BONUCA) will
continue to enjoy the confidence of the Secretary-
General and the Security Council.
