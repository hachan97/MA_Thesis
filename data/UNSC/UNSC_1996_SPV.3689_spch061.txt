The President: There are no further speakers on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.

Before adjourning the meeting, I should like to thank
all speakers for the interesting and lively debate. We have
heard quite a number of concrete ideas and proposals for
improving demining efforts in the context of peace-
keeping
 

operations, some of which, I trust, stand a chance of being
followed up and successfully implemented.

The meeting rose at 6.30 p.m.
