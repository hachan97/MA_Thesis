Mr. Eldon (United Kingdom): I would first like to
associate myself with the statement made earlier in this
debate by the Permanent Representative of Finland on
behalf of the European Union. I can, as a result, be
extremely brief.

The draft resolution on which we are about to vote
today, and which the United Kingdom had the honour to
pilot through the negotiations in the Council, marks the
dawn of a new era for both the United Nations and East
Timor.

There is a pressing need not only to rebuild East
Timor after the destruction it has suffered, but also to
establish and build up an administrative framework for the
transition to independence. By creating an administration
and a judicial system, the United Nations Transitional
Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) can lay the
groundwork for the independent East Timor for which its
people voted so overwhelmingly.

Achieving this difficult objective will be both a major
challenge and a severe test for the United Nations. First of
all, it is important that UNTAET be deployed as quickly as
possible. But the job must also be done right. That means
that the resources of the entire United Nations system -
including the funds, programmes and international financial
institutions - must be mobilized, and the East Timorese
people must be fully involved in every step of the process.

Finally, I should not let pass this opportunity to
congratulate both the United Nations Mission in East Timor
and the International Force, East Timor on difficult jobs
extraordinarily well done in extremely difficult
circumstances. Their performance will be the key to a
smooth transition to UNTAET, which should take place as
soon as possible.
