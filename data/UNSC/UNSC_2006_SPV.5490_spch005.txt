Sir Emyr Jones Parry (United Kingdom): The
United Kingdom has made clear its grave concern
about the missile launches by the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea on 5 July. Many other countries
have done the same. Those missile tests were carried
out despite the urgings of the international community.
The choice to conduct those launches took place
against a particular backdrop: a stated intention to
withdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons, a statement of possession of nuclear
weapons and a commitment to a moratorium on missile
testing that was reaffirmed as recently as September
2005.

Since the launches, the Government of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea has maintained
that they were part of a military policy that the
Government of the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea intends to continue to pursue. Against that
backdrop, those launches were, as has been widely
said, provocative, and have served only to raise
tensions in the region. In our view, it is important that
the Council react robustly and coherently. The United
Kingdom is therefore delighted that the Council has
unanimously agreed the resolution, and the united
signal sent by the Council in this strong resolution is
powerful and welcome.

The requirements of the resolution are clear, and
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and all
States concerned must now comply with these
obligations.
