Mr. Arias (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): Like
other delegations that have taken the floor, the
delegation of Panama is concerned at the situation of
violence prevailing in South Ossetia and other regions
that are part of Georgia.

But of greatest concern is the fact that the
Security Council has been unable to reach agreement
and understanding regarding questions of fact. The
versions offered today of events in South Ossetia are
considerably divergent, but they have both been
accepted by the Council. Nonetheless, along with
others, Panama appeals for an immediate cessation of
hostilities and a return to the status quo ante in order to
facilitate peaceful negotiations.
