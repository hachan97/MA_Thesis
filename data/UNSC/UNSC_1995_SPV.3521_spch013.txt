Mr. Graf Zu Rantzau (Germany): On behalf of my
Government I have today, together with all the other
members of the Security Council, voted in favour of the
draft resolution which the Council has adopted today.

This resolution, as we all know, was called for by the
assassination of two French soldiers in the service of peace.
The feelings of my delegation and of my Government are
divided between profound compassion for the families of
those killed and for the French Government and
indescribable outrage at this act, a most heinous, most
barbaric, most cowardly, most unsoldier-like and most
politically senseless act: the assassination of an
unsuspecting person from a safe distance and under cover.

 

The act is all the more despicable if it is directed
against young men whose sole purpose, in the service of
their country, of the United Nations and of peace, is to
bring about peace, to keep peace and to save lives. An act
such as this proves the utter cynicism of, and the total
disregard for decency and civilized human behaviour by,
those who are responsible for the act. The question must
be raised whether there is really any will to come to a
peaceful arrangement in this conflict-torn area.

My Government's respect goes to those
Governments that, in spite of the dangers that have been
demonstrated on more than one occasion, still maintain
the presence of their United Nations peace-keeping troops
in the area.
