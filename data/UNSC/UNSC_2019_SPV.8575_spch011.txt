Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
thank Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo and High
Commissioner Zannier for their briefings.

China has always held an objective and impartial
position on the issue of Ukraine. We respect the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries,
including Ukraine. China believes that all the parties
concerned should fully implement resolution 2202 (2015)
and the new Minsk agreements, remain committed to
the overall direction of political settlement and actively
seek a comprehensive, lasting and balanced solution to
the Ukrainian issue.

The situation in Ukraine involves both complex
historical and contemporary factors. China supports
the parties concerned in their efforts to resolve their
relevant differences quickly through dialogue and
negotiations on the basis of taking into account and
accommodating the legitimate concerns of all regions
and ethnic groups in Ukraine so as to reach a final
settlement that is acceptable to all parties.

The Security Council should play a constructive
role and create a favourable external environment for
the proper settlement of relevant issues, advancing
peace, stability and development in Ukraine, promoting
harmony among its various ethnic communities and
enhancing peaceful coexistence between Ukraine and
other countries in the region.
