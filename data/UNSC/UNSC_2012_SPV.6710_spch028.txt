The President: There are no further names
inscribed on the list of speakers. I would like to
express my delegation's appreciation to members of
the Council, especially my colleagues, the Permanent
Representatives, their respective staffs and the Council
secretariat for all the support that they have given us
during South Africa's presidency this month of January.

Indeed, it was a busy month. We could not have
done it alone and without the hard work, support and
positive contributions of every delegation and
representatives of the Secretariat, as well as the
interpreters, translators, meetings services and sound
engineers.

As we end our presidency, I know that I speak on
behalf of the Council in wishing the Togolese
delegation good luck for the month of February.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 6.35 p.m.
