Mrs. Van Vlierberge (Belgium) (spoke in French):
Belgium welcomes the adoption of resolution 2498
(2019), which extends the partial lifting ofthe embargo to
support security sector reform in Somalia. The sanctions
regime contributes to the fight against Al-Shabaab and

to countering threats to peace and security in Somalia,
which also affect the neighbouring countries.

Belgium welcomes the efforts made by the
United Kingdom penholder to update the embargo
measures in order to enhance their transparency and
to take into account the threat posed by improvised
explosive devices. We also welcome the clear language
emphasizing the need for the sanctions committee to
exchange information with the Special Representative
of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed
Conflict, the Special Representative for Sexual Violence
in Conflict and the Office of the High Commissioner
for Human Rights.

The resolution also renews the mandate of the
Panel of Experts on Somalia, and we call on the Federal
Government of Somalia to resume cooperation with
the experts, which should enable us to work together
towards the common goal of peace and security
in Somalia.
