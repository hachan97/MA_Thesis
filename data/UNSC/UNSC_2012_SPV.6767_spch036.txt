The President: I will now make a short statement
in my national capacity.

It is unfortunate that the representative of
Armenia has attempted to use the opportunity of our
debate to make groundless, propagandistic statements.
It is well known that international Armenian terrorism
has bloody, historic antecedents in the perpetration of
numerous terroristic acts in various countries and the
killing of thousands of innocent people.

I would like to inform the Security Council that
yesterday a letter was sent to the Secretary-General
containing information on facts that attest to Armenia's
organization and implementation of numerous terrorist
acts against Azerbaijan and other countries. That
information affords Council members and the broader
international community an opportunity to make their
own assessment of the matter and to draw conclusions
about this hopeless attempt by Armenian propaganda to
mislead the United Nations in general and the Security
Council in particular.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

There are no more speakers inscribed on my list.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 1.45 pm.
