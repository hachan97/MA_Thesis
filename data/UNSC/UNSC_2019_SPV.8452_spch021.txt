Mr. Ipo (Cote d'Ivoire) (spoke in French): My
delegation thanks Under-Secretary-General Rosemary
DiCarlo for her comprehensive briefing and welcomes
the Ministers who are attending this meeting.

My delegation is concerned about the latest
developments in the political and institutional crisis
that has shaken Venezuela in recent years. While
compounded by economic difficulties, the situation
has provoked a humanitarian crisis and an exodus of
Venezuelans to neighbouring countries.

In the light of that situation, my country calls on
the international community to mobilize efforts by
implementing all the mechanisms provided for by
the Charter of the United Nations, with a view to the
peaceful settlement of the crisis, thereby alleviating the
suffering of the Venezuelan people, who aspire to better
living conditions. In that regard, my delegation urges all
stakeholders to exercise restraint and resolutely engage
on the path towards dialogue and consultation in order
to resolve their differences. We also call on them to
use all legal and peaceful means to find appropriate
solutions to the institutional and political conflict,
which has entered a critical phase in recent days.

My country also calls on actors in the region to
support all peaceful initiatives that can contribute to
the resolution of the crisis. Venezuela's stability is
essential for both its inhabitants and the region as a
whole. In that context, the United Nations must play a
leading role in supporting the efforts of the subregion,
within the framework of preventive diplomacy.

In conclusion, Cote d'Ivoire reiterates its consistent
position that only a path of dialogue and spirit of
compromise allows for the lasting settlement of any
dispute. We therefore again urge all stakeholders in the
Venezuelan conflict to overcome their differences and
engage in frank negotiations to end the crisis.
