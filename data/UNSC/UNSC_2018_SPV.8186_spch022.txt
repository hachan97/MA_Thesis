Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We fail to understand, Sir, why you have
proposed limiting the statement of the representative of
the Syrian Arab Republic on the important issue under
discussion. His country is directly involved and where
everything being discussed is taking place. We must
afford an opportunity for the representative of Syria to
speak for the full amount oftime required to deliver his
statement. I do not believe we need any artificial limits
on his statement.
