Sir Emyr Jones Parry (United Kingdom): The
text just adopted as Security Council resolution 1500
(2003) reflects the vital role of the United Nations in
Iraq and creates the United Nations Assistance Mission
for Iraq (UNAMI). It also rightfully welcomes the
establishment of the Governing Council of Iraq. We are
all agreed that the goal is to create, as soon as possible,
an internationally representative Government
exercising the sovereignty of Iraq. That must be
worked up with and by the Iraqi people. We want to
make progress rapidly, but of course it will take some
time to create the rights and opportunities which have
so long been denied to the Iraqi population.

The United Kingdom is working with the
coalition partners for an Iraq which can assume its
rightful place in the international community and
where the instruments of the international community
can operate normally. That will entail a growing role
for the United Nations and its agencies, and UNAMI
will be an important catalyst for this.

Lastly, the United Kingdom welcomes the support
given to this resolution, reflecting the Security Council
coming together and its members increasingly
converging to work for the shared objective of a stable,
united and free Iraq.
