Mr. Edmond (Haiti) (spoke in French): First, I want
to thank Mr. Lacroix and his team once again. I also
want to take this opportunity to thank Ms. Bachelet.
After our last encounter in Geneva, I promised her that
I would consider the establishment of an office in Haiti.
We are working diligently on that and assure her that
she will have a response soon in that regard.

Mr. President, I did not want to conclude without
thanking you once again for the invitation you kindly
extended to me to participate in this meeting.

My country, Haiti, is now at a very complicated
crossroads, where we, as Haitians, must decide whether
we will continue to watch our country decline or
consolidate not only the democratic gains but the legacy
that our founding fathers left us. That is what I want to
believe today.

I know that by 15 October, Haiti will no longer
be within the remit of the Security Council, that is to
say, of Chapter VII of the Charter. But I have certainly
understood and greatly appreciate the various concerns,
particularly those related to whether Haiti will be able
continue alone after the departure of MINUJUSTH.
I would say in response that over 15 years, the
Council has shown that it knows how to feed this baby,
especially the Haitian National Police, helping it to
function on its own. It is certainly up to us Haitians to
work and to find the crucial right moment to sit down
and define the future of this country of ours. We will
always be grateful for the support of our international
friends, but today we Haitians find ourselves at this
crossroads with a choice to make. Do we want to save
this country - as I said in my remarks, to restore it to
the international scene where it was before - or will
we continue to watch its slow decline? I want to believe
that we will choose the first option: to sit down, work
together and bring Haiti back to life from its ashes.
