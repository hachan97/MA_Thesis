Mr. Kolby (Norway): 1 am also grateful for the
two briefings. I will only make three points regarding
the work of the United Nations Peace-building Support
Office in the Central African Republic (BONUCA).

First, we share the concern of the Special
Representative that political dialogue no longer seems
to be on the agenda. We agree with the
recommendations in the report aimed at strengthening
BONUCA's mandate in bringing about political
dialogue and national reconciliation.

Secondly, the report states that the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General and BONUCA
will pay special attention to the human rights situation
and take appropriate steps to improve the situation. We
support this prioritization of human rights. Norway
believes that the promotion and protection of human
rights are among the most important elements in
BONUCA's mandate.

Thirdly, we strongly support the efforts of
BONUCA to strengthen the national capacity to
enforce the rule of law and facilitate the disarmament
and restructuring of the defence and security forces.
We commend the Government for appointing a minister
responsible for restructuring the defence and security
forces.
