Mr. Samvelian (Armenia): I will be very brief.
Listening to the statement of the Azerbaijani delegation,
one comes to a very simple conclusion. Azerbaijan has
turned Armenophobia into State propaganda at a level
that is far beyond injurious. That alarming assessment
has been voiced by international and intergovernmental
institutions that specialize in combating racism. The
speaker from Azerbaijan was referring to four Security
Council resolutions that are more or less 20 years old.
Meanwhile, Azerbaijan continues to reinterpret those
resolutions, whose core requirement was the immediate
cessation of all hostile acts and the establishment of a
durable ceasefire. Azerbaijan not only failed to comply
with that requirement, it intensified its aggression and
its military operation against Armenia in Nagorno
Karabakh, using mercenaries closely linked to notorious
terrorist organizations.

Regardless of Azerbaijan's distractive stance,
Armenia will continue its efforts to settle the Nagorno
Karabakh conflict by exclusively peaceful means
and on a basis of the purposes, principles and norms
enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.
