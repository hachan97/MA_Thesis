Mr. Vassilakis (Greece) (spoke in French): I, too,
would like to welcome the Minister of Justice of
Burundi, Mr. Kiganahe, and to thank him for having
travelled to New York to express the views and
decisions of his Government. Our sincere thanks go
also to Assistant Secretary-General Zacklin for his very
clear and succinct report.

In establishing a judicial commission of inquiry,
we always face a dilemma: we need to punish those
who have committed crimes without endangering the
reconciliation process within the country, in which all
must be involved. We support fully the
recommendations to create a truth and reconciliation
commission as well as a special chamber. We
congratulate the Government of Burundi and the
Burundian parties, who had the courage to take this
decision to establish justice in the country and to put
an end to impunity. That could serve as a precedent for
avoiding similar situations in the future.

We wish you every success, Mr. Minister. As you
have just heard, I believe, the representatives of the
Security Council will stand with you.
