The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank
the Permanent Observer of Palestine for the kind words he
addressed to me.

Before calling on the next speaker, I wish to inform
the Council that I have just received a letter from the
representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran, in which he
requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the
item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the discussion,
without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Takht-Ravanchi
(Islamic Republic of Iran) took a seat at the side of
the Council Chamber.

The next speaker is the representative of Israel, on
whom I now call.
