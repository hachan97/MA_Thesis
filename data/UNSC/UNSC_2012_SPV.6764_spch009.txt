Mr. Briens (France) (spoke in French): France
welcomes the adoption of resolution 2046 (2012). In
the past few weeks, the African Union has done its
utmost not only to prevent an escalation of the current
conflict between the Sudan and South Sudan, but also
to enable the rapid resumption of negotiations between
the two States, under the auspices of President Mbeki,
on issues of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement
that are still pending.

In that context, the African Union Peace and
Security Council, meeting at the ministerial level,
adopted a plan of action for the Sudan and South Sudan
to emerge from the crisis that establishes clear
deadlines. The African Union then turned to the
Council to endorse the plan.

All Security Council members unanimously
agreed that the Security Council had to respond to that
request. Thanks to today's vote, the action plan now
has the authority of a Chapter VII resolution, as the
African Union wanted. With the resolution, the
Security Council underscores that it expects the Sudan
and South Sudan to immediately end hostilities, to set
up a demilitarized zone along their common border,
and to withdraw their troops from the disputed region
of Abyei. The Sudan and South Sudan must rapidly
return to the negotiating table so that outstanding
issues of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement can be
settled within three months.

As all Council members wanted, the resolution
thus provides a clear way out of the crisis. It is now up
to the Sudanese parties to immediately implement the
demands of the Security Council.
