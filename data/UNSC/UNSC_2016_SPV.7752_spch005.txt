Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
commends the positive initiatives taken by the
Burundian Government to maintain national stability
and promote internal reconciliation, and urges the
parties in Burundi to actively participate in the political
dialogue and resolve their differences peacefully
through dialogue and consultation. China supports
the mediation efforts of regional and subregional
organizations, such as the African Union and the East
African Community, on the question of Burundi, and
the United Nations ongoing constructive role in seeking
a political solution to the question.

United Nations peacekeeping operations and special
political missions should be deployed on the basis of
full consultation with the country concerned and follow
the principle of the consent of the host country. That is
the only way to ensure that peacekeeping operations
and special political missions can deploy smoothly and
implement their mandate.

On the question of sending United Nations police
to Burundi, it is necessary to respect the sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity of Burundi and
engage in full consultations with its Government in
an effort to reach a Burundi-led settlement that enjoys
the consent of all concerned parties. Resolution 2303
(2015) does not address the aforementioned principles.
China was therefore compelled to abstain in the voting.
China urges the parties concerned to proceed with
caution on the question of sending police to Burundi,
to consult fully with the Burundian Government and
to reach an agreement in advance of their deployment.
