Mr. Baja (Philippines): The Philippines voted in
favour of resolution 1564 (2004), just adopted by the
Security Council. The resolution gives hope to the
victims of the human catastrophe now taking place in
Darfur and challenges the conscience of the
international community to come to their aid with
bread and with justice. Resolution 1564 (2004) also
signals to the parties in Sudan - the Government, the
rebel groups and the militias - that they must save
lives and protect the population's dignity and property,
even as it acknowledges the measures that the
Government in Khartoum has adopted towards that end
and gives it time and space to do more. A State has the
responsibility to protect its citizens, and, if it is unable
or unwilling to do so, the international community -
the Security Council - has the moral and legal
authority to enable that State to assume that
responsibility.

We endorse the leadership role given to the
African Union, aimed at the peaceful conclusion of the
crisis and the protection of the welfare of the people of
Darfur.

The adoption of resolution 1564 (2004) also
shows that the Security Council can and will act under
circumstances similar to those obtaining in Darfur. We
endorse that course of action and therefore voted in
favour of resolution 1564 (2004).
