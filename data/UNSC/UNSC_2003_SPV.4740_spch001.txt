The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on his mission of good
offices in Cyprus (S/2003/398). Members of the
Council also have before them document S/2003/418,
which contains the text of a draft resolution submitted
by Bulgaria, France, Germany, Spain, the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the
United States of America.

It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Guinea, Mexico, Pakistan,
Russian Federation, Spain, Syrian Arab Republic,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, United States of America
The President (spoke in Spanish): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1475 (2003).

I now call on the representative of the Russian
Federation, who wishes to make a statement following
the voting.
