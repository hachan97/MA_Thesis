Mr. Laasel (Morocco) (spoke in French): We regret
the absence of consensus on the draft resolution before
us, which should have brought us together rather than
divide us. We wish to underscore that the meeting of
the African ministerial delegation with the members
of the Security Council on 31 October allowed for
sincere and frank discussions on this matter. The
ministerial African delegation also had an opportunity
to present the substance and reasoning behind Africa's
presentation of the draft resolution. We share those
motives.

Kenya has undertaken a number of significant
reforms in recent years, including by relaunching the
process of national reconciliation in 2008, the adoption
in 2010 ofa new Constitution, and the establishment of
institutions to protect human rights. These reforms led
to the democratic election of Mr. Uhuru Kenyatta as
President and Mr. William Ruto as Deputy President.
Moreover, Kenya, a target of terrorism in Africa, has
shown untiring commitment to fighting terrorism,
which is an enormous challenge to its stability and that
of East Africa as a whole. The Westgate Mall attack in
Nairobi in September, which caused dozens of deaths,
attests to that.

During consultations on the draft resolution, Africa
openly and constructively committed itself to reaching
a consensus-based document. At this time, we express
our appreciation to the other members of the Council
for their willingness to discuss this matter and for their
efforts to find common ground, but we regret that it
was not possible to achieve a united position on the
draft resolution.
