The President: I thank the representative in
Namibia for his comprehensive intervention. In his
statement, he grasped one of the major reasons which
prompted this presidency to propose holding the
current debate. Indeed, a regular review of the
Council's decisions represents an important means for
ensuring their practical implementation.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Belarus. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
