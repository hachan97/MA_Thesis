Mr. Hadi: First, I should like to thank the United
States for having invited me today. I think that this very
much helped me to fulfil the promise that I made to the
people that I would convey their suffering to the Council.

Secondly, I wish to thank the Member States for
listening to me. As a matter of fact, this is the first time
that I feel that I am working as an ambassador, but this
time an ambassador for the women and the children,
an ambassador for the voiceless and an ambassador for
the people in Yemen, who do not have the opportunity
to come here and express what they are going through.
When I was speaking, the images of the people that I
met came into my mind, and I am glad that I am able to
convey part of what I saw to the Council.
Last but not least, I wish to leave the Council with
one thought: saving lives in Yemen is doable. It is not
mission impossible. It can be done, and we have done
it in many places in the world. What we want is the
support of the Council. We want the support of all
Member States. We want the support of the international
community. There is no reason to lose even one life in
Yemen, so I would repeat once again that saving lives is
not mission impossible. We will do it.
