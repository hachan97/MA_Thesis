We thank the Federal Republic of Germany for the invitation to participate in this debate. Talking today about the Middle East necessarily leads to considering the announcements regarding Israel's plans to annex occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank. We urge the authorities of that brotherly country to be guided by the general commitment of all Member States to act in accordance with Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations. We recall that the expansion of settlements has been condemned by the Security Council, since it constitutes a violation of international humanitarian law and is a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. For Argentina, the Israeli settlements, as well as any pretense of annexing Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, have no legal validity and constitute a flagrant violation of international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of a general, just and lasting peace based on two democratic States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and within secure and recognized borders. Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, international law, human rights law and international humanitarian law as fundamental pillars of a rules-based international order, Argentina questions any decision that deviates from fundamental principles, such as the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force, as recalled in advisory opinions of the International Court of Justice. For this reason, Argentina reaffirms its determination to support a definitive peace agreement in the region based on international law and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and reiterates that it will not recognize any changes to the lines of 4 June of 1967, including regarding Jerusalem, other than those agreed by the parties through negotiations. In this regard, Argentina remains convinced that the only solution is for the parties to sit down to negotiate within the framework of a process that leads to a solution resulting in the emergence of an independent, democratic, viable and territorially contiguous Palestinian State, which lives in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours.
