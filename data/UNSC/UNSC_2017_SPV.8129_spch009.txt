Mr. Zhang Dianbin (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China offers its sympathy and deep condolences to the
bereaved families and the Governments of Tanazania
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo over the
heavy casualities suffered by the personnel of the
United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in an attack
against it.

The current security situation in the Sahel region is
severe. The countries of the Group of Five for the Sahel
(G-S Sahel) have decided to establish a Joint Force
to address regional security challenges on their own.
This reflects the self-reliance, unity and cooperation
of African countries and is an important contribution
to peace and security in Africa and the world at
large. At the same time, the Sahel G-5 Force is facing
such difficulties as insufficient financial resources,
technology and equipment, and needs the international
community's support.

Resolution 2391 (2017), which was just adopted by
the Council, will facilitate the support of the United
Nations and the international community to the Force.
China therefore voted in favour of the resolution.
China calls on the Security Council to fully respect
and enable African ownership in seeking African
solutions to African problem, to support the efforts
of Sahel countries in maintaining regional peace and
security, and to encourage the United Nations and
the international community to provide the G-5 Sahel
Joint Force with the necessary support, including
financial resources.

China is ready to join the international community
in playing a constructive role towards achieving peace,
stability and development in the Sahel and on the
African continent.
