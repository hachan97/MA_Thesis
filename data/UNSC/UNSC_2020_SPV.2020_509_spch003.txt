The Russian delegation supported the initiative to extend for one more year the special inspection regime on the high seas off the coast of Libya established under resolution 2292 (2016), with the objective of ensuring respect for the Security Council's arms embargo. Such special measures could be useful as the Libyan crisis remains a serious source of regional instability, accompanied by illicit arms trafficking. We took note of the decision of the European Union to launch the new European Union Naval Force Mediterranean Operation, aimed at supporting the implementation of the United Nations arms embargo on Libya. The Operation should fully comply with international law as well as with the framework established by resolution 2292 (2016). Any modifications to its activities beyond the scope of that resolution will require the consent of the Security Council. We expect Operation IRINI to be conducted along the entire Libyan coast. Imbalance or bias in that regard could negatively affect international efforts aimed at promoting dialogue between the Libyan parties. We reaffirm the central role of the United Nations in the Libyan settlement. We hope that United Nations mediation will lead to success and look forward to the early appointment of a new Special Representative of the Secretary-General.
