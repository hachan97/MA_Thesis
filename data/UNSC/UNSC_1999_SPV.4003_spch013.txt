Mr. Petrella (Argentina)(spoke in Spanish): I wish
to note that our co-sponsorship of the resolution that has
just been adopted, put forward by Bahrain and Malaysia,
is in keeping with Argentina's commitment to defending
human rights in all parts of the world, wherever they may
be under assault. The fact that the tragic situation that
prompted us to hold this meeting today should be taking
place in Europe heightens our concern, since this appears
to mean that neither development nor education nor
tradition nor historical experience renders us immune to
humanitarian catastrophes of this kind.

In our opinion, this resolution sets out to give
impetus to specific relief and assistance action, in the
affected countries, which definitely include the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia. The statements made two days
ago by the United Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights upon visiting the region make further
comments unnecessary.

 

Finally, as we said in earlier statements, there must be
a prompt political solution to the crisis brought on by a
humanitarian disaster that has already cost many lives and
caused much suffering. The members of the Council agree
that diplomacy is the best instrument with which to achieve
that objective. Hence the importance of operative paragraph
5 and the exhortation to all parties to contribute to the
objective stated therein.

Finally, I wish to call for United Nations staff and
other humanitarian workers in the territories and countries
involved in this grave conflict to be given the necessary
protection in accordance with the relevant international
conventions. In this context, we wish respectfully to ask the
Yugoslav Government to release the Australian
humanitarian workers.
