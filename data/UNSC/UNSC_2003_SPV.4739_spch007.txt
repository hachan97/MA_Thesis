The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the
representative of Angola for his kind words addressed
to me. The next speaker inscribed on my list is Mr.
Cesar Gaviria, the Secretary General of the
Organization of American States. I invite him to take a
seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
