Mr. Pressman (United States of America): I am
pleased that the representative ofthe Russian Federation
can agree with so much of what I had to say. It is too
bad, however, that we cannot agree to some basic facts
in this Chamber. The facts remain that Russia backed
the separatists, Russia armed the separatists and Russia
led a military campaign that led to the purported
annexation of Crimea, in Violation of the Charter of
the United Nations. Those are the facts and, sadly for
the people victimized by this crisis and these conflicts,
these facts remain unchanged, regardless of whatever
distractions are offered in the Chamber today.
