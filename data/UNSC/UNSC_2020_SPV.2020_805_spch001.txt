I have the honour to refer to the draft resolution contained in document S/2020/797, submitted by the United States of America, in connection with the agenda item "Non-proliferation". In accordance with the voting procedure as agreed by the members and set out in the letter by the President of the Security Council dated 27 March 2020 (S/2020/253) - a procedure agreed in light of the extraordinary circumstances caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic - the draft resolution received two votes in favour (the Dominican Republic and the United States of America), two against (China and the Russian Federation) and eleven abstentions (Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Indonesia, the Niger, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, South Africa, Tunisia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Viet Nam). The draft resolution has not been adopted, having failed to obtain the required number of votes. Pursuant to that procedure, I enclose herewith copies of the related documents: My letter dated 13 August 2020, addressed to the Permanent Representatives of the members of the Security Council, putting to the vote the draft resolution contained in document S/2020/797 (annex | and enclosure); Letters received in response from the members of the Security Council indicating their national positions on the draft resolution (annexes 2 to 16); Statements subsequently submitted by members of the Security Council providing explanations of their votes (annexes 17 to 27); A statement by the Islamic Republic of Iran (annex 28).
