The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter dated
23 March 2004 from the Chairman of the Committee
on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the
Palestinian People, which reads as follows:

"In my capacity as Chairman of the
Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable
Rights of the Palestinian People, I have the
honour to request that I be invited to participate
in the debate on the situation in the Middle East,
including the Palestinian question, under rule 39
of the provisional rules of procedure of the
Security Council."

In accordance with past practice in this matter, I
propose that the Council extend an invitation under
rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure to the
Chairman of the Committee on the Exercise of the
Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Paul Badji
took the seat reserved for him at the side of the
Council Chamber.

The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now consider the item on its agenda.

The Council is meeting pursuant to the request
presented in the letter dated 23 March 2004 addressed
to the President of the Security Council by the Charge
d'affaires ad interim of the permanent mission of the
Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to the United Nations, issued
in document S/2004/233.

I wish to draw the attention of the members of the
Council to document S/2004/23l, which contains a
letter dated 22 March 2004 from the Permanent
Observer of Palestine.

I would now like to welcome the Secretary-
General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to this meeting.

I now give the floor to the Permanent Observer of
Palestine.
