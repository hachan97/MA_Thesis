The President (spoke in Russian): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Liechtenstein in which he requests
to be invited to participate in the consideration of the
item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the
usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the
Council, to invite that representative to participate in
the consideration of the item, without the right to vote,
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Wenaweser
(Liechtenstein) took the seat reserved for him at
the side of the Council Chamber.

The President (spoke in Russian): I now give the
floor to the representative of the Syrian Arab Republic.
