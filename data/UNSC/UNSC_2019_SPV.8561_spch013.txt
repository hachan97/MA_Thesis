The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank Mr. Lillie
for his briefing.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to paragraph 22 of presidential note S/2017/507, which
encourages all participants in Council meetings to
deliver their statements in five minutes or less so that
the Security Council can make the best possible use of
its time, in particular in open meetings.

I now give the floor to those Council members who
wish to make statements.
