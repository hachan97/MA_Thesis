The President: I thank Lieutenant General
Prakash for his briefing.

I now give the floor to Major General Alberto
Asarta Cuevas. Let me take this opportunity to reiterate
the Council's strong condemnation of the attacks
perpetrated against the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon yesterday in Saida and to convey through him
our condolences to the injured and their families.
