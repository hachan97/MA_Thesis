The President (spoke in Spanish): Before I give
the floor to the next speaker, I would like to inform
the Council that, based on news coming in to us, the
Ambassador of the Russian Federation to Turkey,
Mr. Andrey Karlov, has been shot. He is seriously
wounded and is being transferred to a hospital in
Ankara. We have no further details at this point.
