Mr. Wolff (United States): I was not intending to
take the floor. I am not psychologist, and I do not know
what brought on the free association we heard from
Ambassador Churkin.

There are eight members of this Council that have
recognized Kosovo, eight members that concluded that
recognition was the right thing to do. None of them did
it under the cover of force, as we have heard.

There is a body of resolutions related to Iraq,
which we are all quite familiar with, and violations of
those resolutions over many years. There were
divisions on the Iraq war, those are well- known. We
thought we had overcome them. Apparently there seem
to still be some lingering frustrations. But there is no
territorial ambition or desire to dismember Iraq.

As for Afghanistan, we have a coalition in place
trying to consolidate a democracy - again, with no
territorial ambitions - and trying to help the
democratically elected Government.

We have heard specious comparisons before.
They cannot detract or deflect from the facts before us,
and those remain very clear. As I have said before,
facts are stubborn things. Russia invaded Georgia,
Russia is occupying Georgia, and under that
occupation, Russia is dismembering Georgia, in full
disregard of that country's territorial integrity. No
amount of effort to compare it with completely
unrelated and dissimilar situations can excuse that.
