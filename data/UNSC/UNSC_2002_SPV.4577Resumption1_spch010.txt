Mr. Mar Dieye: I must say here that the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been a
kind of precursor in terms of this integrated
framework. Indeed, we already have our Regional
Cooperation Framework, which is helping to
implement programmes at the regional level. As I said
earlier, we are supporting the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) moratorium on small
arms; we have a regional programme to help civil
society participate in the ongoing peace process; and
we have a regional programme that is promoting
entrepreneur development, with a focus on women
entrepreneurs. All of these instruments are available to
us. What has been lacking so far is the political
framework to secure our economic and development
efforts.

I think that, now that we have the United Nations
Office in Dakar, we have the right mix so that
collectively we can do optimum work on the ground.
