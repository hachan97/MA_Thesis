The President (interpretation from French): On
behalf of the members of the Security Council, I should
like to express profound grief and sorrow at the death of
His Majesty King Hussein Ibn Talal of the Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan. King Hussein's entire life was
dedicated to a devoted service to his country and a tireless
search for peace, stability and understanding in the Middle
East. His loss will be greatly felt.

On behalf of the Security Council, I should like to
convey to His Majesty King Abdullah, the bereaved family
and the people of Jordan the Council's profound
condolences.

I now invite the members of the Council to rise and
observe a minute of silence in tribute to the memory of His
Majesty King Hussein lbn Talal of the Hashemite Kingdom
of Jordan.

The members of the Security Council observed a
minute of silence.

Expression of thanks to the retiring President

The President (interpretation from French): As this
is the first meeting of the Security Council for the month
of February, I should like to take this opportunity to pay
tribute, on behalf of the Council, to His Excellency
Mr. Celso Amorim, Permanent Representative of Brazil to
the United Nations, for his service as President of the
Security Council for the month of January 1999. I am sure
I speak for all members of the Security Council in
expressing deep appreciation to Ambassador Amorim for
the great diplomatic skill with which he conducted the
Council's business last month.
