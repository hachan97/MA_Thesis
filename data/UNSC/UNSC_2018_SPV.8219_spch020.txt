The President: As this may be the last meeting
of the Council for the month of March, let me express
the sincere appreciation and thanks of the delegation
of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to the members of
the Council, especially my colleagues the Permanent
Representatives and their respective staff, and to the
secretariat of the Council for all the support they have
given to us.

It has been a busy month, and one in which we rallied
to consensus on several important issues within our
purview. We could not have done it alone or without the
hard work, support and positive contributions of every
delegation and the representatives of the Secretariat,
as well as all the relevant conference service officers,
interpreters and security staff.

As we end our presidency, I know I speak on behalf
of the Council in wishing the delegation of Peru good
luck in the coming month. Peru may rest assured that
we will do our utmost in supporting it in fulfilling its
grave responsibilities in the presidency of the Security
Council in April.

The meeting rose at 8.50 pm.
