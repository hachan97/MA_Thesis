The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank
Ambassador Araud for his briefing. On behalf of the
Council, I wish to thank all members of the Security
Council and the Secretariat who took part in the
mission to the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
which was ably led by Ambassador Araud.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 11.50 am.
