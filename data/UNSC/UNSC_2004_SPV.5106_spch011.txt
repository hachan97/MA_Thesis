The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank
Ambassador Yafiez-Barnuevo of Spain for his kind
words. We appreciate the important role that Spain
played during its chairmanship of the Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1373 (2001). I agree
that there is life beyond the Council; I wish him every
success outside the Council.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 11.15 am.
