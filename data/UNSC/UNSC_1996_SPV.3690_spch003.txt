The President: I take it that the representative of
Sudan was not aware of the Council's new practice of
forgoing compliments addressed to the President and to
his predecessor. All the same, I want to thank him for the
kind words addressed to my predecessor and to myself.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote.

There being no objection it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements before the voting.
