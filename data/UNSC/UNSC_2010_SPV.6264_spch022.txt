The President (spoke in Chinese): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of China.

China respects the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Serbia. We hope that the Government of
Serbia and the Kosovo authorities will find a solution
acceptable to both sides through dialogue and
negotiation. The United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo should continue to
carry out its mandate prudently under resolution 1244
(1999), in line with the changes on the ground in
Kosovo.

We hope that the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General will continue to play an active role
in seeking an appropriate solution to the issue of
Kosovo, including by enhancing communications with
the parties concerned, and in particular in helping push
forward the dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo.

We welcome the efforts of the European Union
Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo as it continues to
undertake its tasks under the overall authority of the
United Nations and within the status-neutral
framework set out in resolution 1244 (1999), so as to
play its due role in maintaining peace and stability in
this region.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

President Tadic has asked for the floor. I now
give him the floor.
