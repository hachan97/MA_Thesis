Mr. Jagne (Gambia): My delegation would simply
like to reiterate that it was flabbergasted by the decision
taken by Iraq on 31 October 1998 to cease cooperation
with the United Nations Special Commission and to
continue imposing restrictions on the work of the
International Atomic Energy Agency. This constituted yet
another slap in the face, especially at that time, when the
Security Council was in the process of fine-tuning a
possible concept for a comprehensive review of sanctions
imposed on Iraq. The Security Council was working
painstakingly in that direction when what had been
conveniently described as a "hiccup" suddenly assumed
another dimension because of the decision taken on 31
October, so that now it looks like a stranglehold. What
this draft resolution is attempting to do is free the
international community from that deadly grip and,
hopefully, break the vicious cycle of mini-crisis after
mini-crisis. We want to move forward.

It was in that spirit that resolution 1194 (1998) was
adopted in order to set in motion the process that would
culminate in a comprehensive review - provided, of
course, that the logical sequence was adhered to. There is
no need to emphasize that the first step in this sequence
of events is for Iraq to rescind its decision of 5 August.
My delegation subscribes wholeheartedly to the View that
by failing thus far to comply with its relevant obligations,
Iraq is unnecessarily postponing the proposed
comprehensive review and, by extension, prolonging the
unwarranted suffering of the people of Iraq.

In view of the fact that the draft resolution calmly
but firmly provides yet another opportunity for Iraq to
resume cooperation, my delegation will vote in favour of
it.
