The President: I thank Ambassador Menkerios
for responding to the issues and questions raised by
members during their statements, and I thank the other
members of the Committee of Experts for their
presence in the Council Chamber today.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council
will remain seized of the matter, and will consider the
recommendations for action contained in the report of
the Committee of Experts.

The meeting rose at 4.10p.m.
