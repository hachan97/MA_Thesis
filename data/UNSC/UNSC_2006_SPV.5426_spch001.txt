The President (spoke in Chinese): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Cote d'Ivoire in which he requests
that his delegation be invited to participate in the
consideration of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the consideration of the item without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

On behalf of the Council, I extend a warm
welcome to His Excellency Mr. Charles Konan Banny,
Prime Minister of Cote d'Ivoire. I request the Chief of
Protocol to escort the Prime Minister to his seat at the
Council table.

Mr. Charles Konan Banny, Prime Minister of
Cete d'Ivoire, was escorted to a seat at the
Council table.

The President (spoke in Chinese): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

I now give the floor to Mr. Charles Konan Banny,
Prime Minister of Cote d'Ivoire.
