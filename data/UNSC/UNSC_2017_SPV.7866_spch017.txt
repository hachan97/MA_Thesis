The President: I shall now make a statement in my
national capacity as representative of Sweden.

Sweden welcomes the Security Council's adoption
today of resolution 2337 (2017) and its display of unity
once again on The Gambia. I would like to add my
voice to those expressing appreciation for the work
of Senegal in that regard. The resolution affirms the
Council's political support for Mr. Adama Barrow as
the democratically elected President and legitimate
representative of The Gambia. It is an important effort
for conflict prevention on the part of the Council and a
positive example of action under Chapters VI and VIII
of the Charter of the United Nations. The Council has
given its political endorsement to the commitment of
the Economic Community of West African States and
the African Union to ensuring respect for the outcome
of the election. It emphasizes that all stakeholders,
inside and outside the Gambia, must exercise restraint
and respect for the rule of law. We are confident that
the regional mediators will continue working for a
peaceful transition and the restoration of normalcy in
the Gambia.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

The meeting rose at 1.40 pm.
