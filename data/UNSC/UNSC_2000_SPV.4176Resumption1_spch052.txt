Ms. Bellamy: We agreed that Mr. Otunnu would
get two seconds and I would get one second, so I will
try to keep my statement even briefer than his.

I would like to express my appreciation, on
behalf of the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) and our colleagues in the United Nations,
for the Council's leadership in taking up this issue
again, for your leadership, Madam President, and
indeed for the really quite impressive turnout by the
many representatives who spoke today, in terms of
their commitment.

I would simply say the following, apart from
committing ourselves to continuing to work with the
Council. The Security Council is a powerful body. The
report before it contains some very important
recommendations, a good number of which are
appropriate to the Council. I ask the Council please not
to study this report to death. As I said in my opening
remarks, and as the Council is aware, childhood is
quite fleeting. It does not come back, so with every
moment that passes, children are moving on. The time
to act is now, and we urge the Council to do so.
