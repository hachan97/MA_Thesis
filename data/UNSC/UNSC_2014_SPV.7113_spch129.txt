Mr. Zeidan (Palestine): My delegation will
not continue the circus started by Israel and its
representatives, but we would just like to add for the
record that Israel's so-called democracy is a democracy
only for Jews, where non-Jews are inferior, whether
they be Muslim, Christian or others, whether it be with
regard to their civil or land rights, or even the right to
life. Israel touts itself as a democracy in the Middle
East but it forgot to also tell us that it is the greatest
violator of human rights and humanitarian law in the
whole world. Israel also forgot to tell us that it is the
only occupying Power in the Middle East.
