The President: You asked some specific
questions which I will ask Sir Kieran to respond to at a
slightly later stage. I know we are due to move to
speakers' responses now, but I would like to hear from
our speaker from the World Bank before I move to
speaker responses at a later stage. Thank you for your
comments and also your idea about a meeting in the
margins ofthe General Assembly later this year.

I would like to invite Mr. Fichtl, the Senior Social
Protection Specialist for Regional Human Development
ofthe World Bank, to take the floor.
