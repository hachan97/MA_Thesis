The President: Before giving the floor to the next
speaker, I would like to inform the Council that it will not
be possible to wind up our meeting without breaking for
lunch. It is, however, my intention to keep the lunch break
to what I would like to describe as a civilized minimum
and, accordingly, I intend to suspend our meeting from
about 1.15 pm. to 2:30 pm.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Slovakia. I invite him to take a seat at the
Council table and to make his statement.
