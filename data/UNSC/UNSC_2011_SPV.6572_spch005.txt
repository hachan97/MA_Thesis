Mr. Assaf (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): We wish
at the outset to emphasize the importance of the United
Nations Disengagement Observer Force's operations,
and to pay tribute to the sacrifices it has made. Today
Lebanon joined the consensus in adopting resolution
1994 (2011). We would have preferred that it be
technical in nature, as had always been the case in the
past, when the resolution was accompanied by a
presidential statement recalling the need to arrive at a
comprehensive, peaceful solution to the conflict in the
Middle East. We hope that this will be the case once
again in future.

We condemn Israel's attempt to change
demographics and to bring about significant changes in
the occupied Syrian Golan area, particularly through
the extension and expansion of settlements, which is a
flagrant violation of international law, of General
Assembly resolution 497 (1981) and the Fourth Geneva
Convention. We call on Israel to implement Security
Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and to
withdraw completely from the occupied Golan Heights
to the 1967 line. We stress the importance of arriving at
ajust, lasting and comprehensive peace in the region of
the Middle East.
