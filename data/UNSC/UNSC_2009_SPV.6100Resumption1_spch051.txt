Mr. Khazaee (Islamic Republic of Iran): I am not
going to take very much of the Council's time, because
we have already placed on record my country's
position. I just wanted to reiterate that we reject the
baseless allegations raised yet again by the
representative of the Israeli regime. Undoubtedly -
and needless to say - these are statements that are
made only to distract the international community's
attention from where it should be, and that is the Israeli
crimes and atrocities, which are very well known to the
international community. Time and again they have
been emphasized not only by Iran and some of the
other countries that the representative of Israel
mentioned, but actually by the whole membership of
the Council and by the whole international community.
We are on record as condemning in the strongest terms
all those crimes and atrocities, which are perpetrated
against the Palestinian people. Indeed, the Israeli
regime has actually displayed one of the clearest
examples of State terrorism. The State terrorism which
09-28062
is being practised by the Israeli regime, together with
the nuclear weapons that are in the hands of that
regime and also coupled with its wicked behaviour,
poses one of the greatest threats that the region and the
international community are facing today.
