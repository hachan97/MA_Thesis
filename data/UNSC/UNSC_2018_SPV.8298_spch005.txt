Mr. Alemu (Ethiopia): We welcome the Council's
unanimous adoption of resolution 2423 (2018), renewing
the mandate of the United Nations Multidimensional
Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA)
for another 12 months. We thank France, as the
penholder, for facilitating the negotiations on the text,
and we appreciate the flexibility and compromise
of all members, which facilitated the resolution's
unanimous adoption.

In spite of enormous challenges and constraints,
MINUSMA peacekeepers are doing commendable work
in supporting the implementation of the Agreement
on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali. We welcome
the recent positive steps taken in the implementation
of the Agreement ahead of the electoral cycle due to
take place in Mali this year. We are confident that the
Government of Mali and the Platform and Coordination
armed groups will take all the steps necessary to fully
and expeditiously deliver on their remaining obligations
under the Agreement, as stipulated in the resolution
that we just adopted.

We appreciate the continued support ofMlNUSMA,
in cooperation with other international partners, to the
efforts of the Malian authorities to combat terrorism and
transnational organized crime, including information-
and intelligence-sharing, planning, training and
capacity-building. The role of MINUSMA continues to
be vital, and the extension of its mandate for another
12 months, in line with the recommendations of the
Secretary-General, is very welcome.

We have taken the right decision and, as we have
always reiterated, the international community has a
heavy responsibility to help Mali overcome its current
security challenges. We all remember how Mali was
an example of democratic governance in Africa before
2011. We are very hopeful that it will rise again.
