The President: I thank the representative of New
Zealand for his kind words addressed to me.

Before giving the floor to the next speaker, I would
like just to say a word about the distribution of speeches
within the Chamber. I think it is important that we all
understand what is happening and what is not happening,
and why.
At the excellent suggestion of the former President
last month - the representative of Bangladesh, who drew
our collective attention to the fact that the great rush to
the door to obtain copies outside significantly disrupted
our deliberations in the Chamber - it was agreed and
published in a note at the end of March that, as long as
countries provided the Secretariat with 200 copies of their
texts, the texts would be discretely and effectively
distributed - as they have been, in the main, today - to
Members throughout the Council Chamber and to other
Members of the Organization, as you have seen done.

When fewer than 200 copies are provided to the
Secretariat, those copies are placed outside. Particularly
because there are fewer of them, the scramble for them is
even greater and the disruption all the more. I would
therefore urge Member States to conform to this excellent
suggestion by Bangladesh and to provide the Secretariat

 

with 200 copies well in advance of their statements so that
they can be quietly and effectively distributed, as in the
main has been the case this afternoon.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Cuba. I invite him to take a seat at the
Council table and to make his statement.
