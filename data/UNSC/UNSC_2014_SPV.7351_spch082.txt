Mr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Today's discussion has once again
demonstrated that our Ukrainian colleagues, as ever,
see terrorists, threats of terrorism and transnational
organized crime in places where other members of
the international community do not. We believe that
Ukraine's abuse of the topic of today's discussion
undermines the chances for creating a united Ukrainian
society. We once again call on the Ukrainian delegation
to consider that, and instead of using the Council for
propagandistic slogans and statements, to focus all
their efforts on contributing constructively to our
discussion of the very topical issue under discussion

here today, that of combating terrorism and its links to
cross-border organized crime.
