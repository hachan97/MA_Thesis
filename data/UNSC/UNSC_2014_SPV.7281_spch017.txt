The President (spoke in Spanish): Before giving
the floor to the next speaker, I will take a minute, as an
aside, to note that sometimes we have that impression
in the Security Council that we are unable to do here
what we are able to do elsewhere. If we can turn off
our cellphones in cinemas and theatres, I would
ask participants, out of respect for the topic we are
considering and for the speakers taking the floor, to
silence their cellphones.
