The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2002/546, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Portugal, the Russian
Federation and the United States of America. I should
also like to draw attention to document S/2002/535
containing a letter dated 26 April 2002 from Portugal,
the Russian Federation and the United States of
America transmitting a joint statement of the observer
countries to the Angolan peace process.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show ofhands.

In favour:
Bulgaria, Cameroon, China, Colombia, France,
Guinea, Ireland, Mauritius, Mexico, Norway,
Russian Federation, Singapore, Syrian Arab
Republic, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, United States of America

The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1412 (2002).

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 11.05 am.
