Mr. Akram (Pakistan): The Government of
Pakistan condemns this most recent act of extrajudicial
execution by Israel in the occupied Palestinian
territories. Despite international condemnation of the
similar extrajudicial execution of Sheikh Yassin a few
weeks ago, Israel has refused to heed the wishes of the
international community that it stop acting in direct
defiance of international law. These extrajudicial
executions are clearly a violation of its obligations
under such international humanitarian law, especially
the Fourth Geneva Convention. No interpretation of the
principle of self-defence can justify such deliberate and
arbitrary executions. A policy of assassination and
killing in an occupied territory as a matter of State
policy cannot contribute to peace and security either
for Israel or for the occupied Palestinian people. Peace
and the rule of law cannot be established by those
acting outside the law.

It is not necessary to repeat that these actions of
Israel have greatly damaged the international
endeavours to break the cycle of violence and to put
the peace process back on track. The international
community supports a two-State solution - a vision of
Palestine and Israel living together side by side within
secure boundaries. The vision can be achieved only
through the implementation of Security Council
resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 1397 (2001) and
1513 (2003), and the Quartet road map, which has been
endorsed by the Security Council.

Let us not forget that the root cause of all the
violence and killing in Palestine and the Middle East is
the fact of foreign occupation by Israel. If an initiative
for greater stability in the region has to be taken, it
must address this root cause and end foreign
occupation. Let us not forget the deep sense of
alienation and frustration that resounds in the whole
Islamic world because of the unending violation of the
fundamental rights of the Palestinian people and other
Islamic peoples.
