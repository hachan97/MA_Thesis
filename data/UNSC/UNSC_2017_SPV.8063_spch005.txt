Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian delegation supported the
adoption of the resolution 2381 (2017), expanding the
mandate of the United Nations Verification Mission in
Colombia. The mission will now provide assistance in
monitoring compliance with the temporary ceasefire
agreement between the Government of Colombia and
the Eje'rcito dc Liberacio'n Nacional. In addition to the
achievements of the peace process with the Fuerzas
Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, we hope that
this ceasefire will complete the final solution to the
lengthy internal conflict and achieve domestic peace
in Colombia.

We value the support of the guarantors in this
process: Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Ecuador, Norway and
Venezuela. We expect that the Government and
the Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional will meet their
obligations in good faith and that the Verification
Mission will provide the necessary assistance to that
end. We believe that expanding the mandate of the
Mission by increasing its staff by 70 international
observers and setting up an additional 33 posts is fully
in line with the expectations of Colombia.

As to the Verification Mission, it has become an
excellent tradition to develop the mandate of the Mission
in close coordination with the Colombians themselves.
Today's consensus vote clearly demonstrates that the
Security Council is ready to provide constant support
for the good faith of the two parties. We are convinced
that the national ownership of the peace process by
the Colombians is the main reason for these positive
developments and the best guarantee for lasting peace
and further developments. That is the most important
lesson both for States that are experiencing a difficult
chapter in their history and for the members of the
Security Council in considering the most complicated
situations on our agenda.
