Mr. Hardeep Singh Puri (India): I take the floor
to state that India has been following with serious
concern the developments in Libya, which have
resulted in the loss of numerous lives and injuries to
many more. We deplore the use of force, which is
totally unacceptable. We earnestly hope that calm and
stability will be restored at the earliest without any
further violence.

We also have concerns about the safety of Indian
nationals and their assets in Libya. We urge the
authorities there to ensure their safety and welfare and
facilitate the departure of those desirous of leaving the
country.

India is not a member of the International
Criminal Court. Of the 192 Members of the United
Nations, only 114 are members of the International
Criminal Court. Five of the 15 members of the
Council, including three permanent members, are not
parties to the Rome Statute. Moreover, we would have
preferred a calibrated and gradual approach. However,
we note that several members of the Council, including
our colleagues from Africa and the Middle East,
believe that referral to the Court would have the effect
of an immediate cessation of violence and the
restoration of calm and stability. The letter from the
Permanent Representative of Libya of 26 February
addressed to you, Madame President, has called for
such a referral and strengthened this view. We have
therefore gone along with the consensus in the Council.

In this context, we draw attention to paragraph 6
of the resolution, concerning national from countries
not parties to the Rome Statute. Similarly, in its
preambular portion, the resolution also recalls article 16
11-24528
of the Rome Statute, under which no investigation or
prosecution may be commenced or proceeded with by
the International Criminal Court for a period of 12
months after the Security Council request to that effect.
