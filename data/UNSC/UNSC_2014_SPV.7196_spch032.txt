The President (spoke in Russian): Before giving the
floor to the next speaker, I would like to draw attention
to the fact that no one has come close to speaking under
the time limit that we have asked speakers, other than
members of the Security Council, to respect. I request
speakers to do their best to limit the length of the text
being read out in our meeting today.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Thailand.
