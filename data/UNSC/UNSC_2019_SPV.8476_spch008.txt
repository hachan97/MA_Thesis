Mr. Singer Weisinger (Dominican Republic) (spoke in Spanish): We take the floor in explanation of
our vote in two regards.

First, the Dominican Republic believes that there is
no other possible solution to the crisis in Venezuela than
the holding of free and competitive elections without
delay, with guarantees for all groups and stakeholders.
Such a peaceful and inclusive political process must
lead Venezuelan society to reconcile with itself and
overcome the differences that have generated these
situations of permanent tension, which endanger the
Venezuelan people as well as the regional environment.

Therefore, to dispel any suspicion, the use of force
is not an option for us. On the contrary, we favour an
inclusive dialogue in which all political actors and
civil society can participate - an indispensable step
for a peaceful, democratic outcome that respects
human rights.

Finally, we understand that it is necessary to create
the conditions conducive to providing assistance to
those in need, in light ofthe serious humanitarian crisis
afflicting the Venezuelan people.
