Mr. Pecsteen de Buytswerve (Belgium) (spoke in French): Belgium aligns itself with the statement just
made by the observer of the European Union. On my
part, I would like to highlight the following points.

It is now more crucial than ever to ensure that
conditions are conducive to stability and dialogue, and
we welcome the efforts made by the Afghan Government
to that end. Furthermore, we believe that the regional
actors should demonstrate their commitment to peace
in Afghanistan and translate these commitments into
concrete action.

We welcome the recommendations of the strategic
review, which once again underscore the coordination of
the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan
(UNAMA) between the various international donors
and the Afghan Government. Belgium will closely
follow the way in which this recommendation is
implemented in practice.

Belgium hopes that the legislative elections will take
place as planned in an acceptable security environment
and with a satisfactory rate of participation, particularly
with regard to women as both voters and candidates.

It is important to ensure that the work carried
out by UNAMA takes into account the developing
commitments of international partners. The ultimate
goal of such partnerships should always be peace and
stabilization in Afghanistan, which are the necessary
preconditions for the well-being of the Afghan people.

Lastly, I would like to touch on the situation of
children in Afghanistan. Three armed groups, as well
as the Afghan National Police, are listed as having
recruited children. The detention of children is also of
concern. As for the Taliban, they are guilty of carrying
out attacks on schools and medical facilities. We call
on all parties to respect international humanitarian law
and encourage the Government to intensify its fight
against impunity in the case of violation.

To conclude, I reiterate Belgium's support
for Afghanistan and its Government, as well as
for UNAMA.
