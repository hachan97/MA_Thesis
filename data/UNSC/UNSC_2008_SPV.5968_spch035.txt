The President (spoke in French): Since I still
have a number of speakers on my list who have not yet
taken the floor and given the lateness of the hour, I
would suggest, with the consent of Council members,
that we suspend the meeting once we have heard the
statements by the representatives of Brazil and Jordan,
and to reconvene at 3 pm. Do Council members
consent to that proposal?

I now give the floor to the representative of
Brazil.
