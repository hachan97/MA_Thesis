Mr. Cunningham (United States): I want to
thank the Secretary-General, the members of the
Council and you, Mr. President, for their kind words,
their support and resolve and their condolences to the
American people on this dark day. We appreciate the
many expressions of concern and support that we have
received from around the world. Our thoughts and
prayers are with the many who died in the attacks and
their families, with the injured and with the many brave
fire-department, emergency-services and police
personnel here in New York who perished and those
who continue to work feverishly even as we speak in
response to the attacks.

Last night, President Bush eloquently addressed
the nation and the world on yesterday's outrage. As
others have noted, this was an assault not just on the
United States, but on all of us who support peace and
democracy and the values for which the United Nations
stands.

The United States has suffered a cowardly and
evil attack, but America is not, and will not be, shaken
in its resolve. We will grieve, and we will heal.

We look to all those who stand for peace, justice
and security in the world to stand together with the
United States to win the war against terrorism. We will
make no distinction between the terrorists who
committed these acts and those who harbour them. We
will bring those responsible to account.

Yesterday's horrifying images, burned now into
the global memory, serve as a constant reminder to all
of the need to stamp out this scourge and of the need
for determination and action to do so.
