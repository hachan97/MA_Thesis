The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

After consultations among Council members, I
have been authorized to make the following statement
on their behalf.

"The Security Council welcomes the Secretary-
General's statement on 23 September 2019,
announcing the agreement of the Government of the
Syrian Arab Republic and the Syrian Negotiations
Commission for a credible, balanced and inclusive
Constitutional Committee facilitated by the United
Nations in Geneva.

"The Security Council determines that the
launch of the Syrian-owned and Syrian-led
Constitutional Committee shall be the beginning of
the political process to end the Syrian conflict, in
line with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015),
that meets the legitimate aspirations of all Syrians.

"The Security Council expresses its
appreciation for the United Nations Special Envoy's
diplomatic engagement to facilitate and finalize the
agreement between the Syrian Arab Republic and
the Syrian opposition to form the Constitutional
Committee, emphasizing its strong support for
Special Envoy Pedersen and the United Nations
initiative to convene the first meeting of the
Constitutional Committee in Geneva, Switzerland,
by 30 October 2019.

"The Security Council reaffirms that there
can be no military solution to the conflict in Syria
and that it can only be resolved through the full
implementation of resolution 2254 (2015).

"The Security Council reaffirms its strong
commitment to the sovereignty, independence,
unity and territorial integrity of Syria."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2019/12.
