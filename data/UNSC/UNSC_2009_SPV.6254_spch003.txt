Mr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): Having voted
in favour of resolution 1907 (2009), just adopted by the
Council, Viet Nam calls on Eritrea and other parties
concerned to show maximal restraint, refrain from
actions that might lead to the exacerbation or
escalation of tension, strictly implement the relevant
Security Council resolutions and expeditiously engage
in dialogue aimed at peacefully resolving their border
dispute.

Viet Nam has been consistent in its position that
international conflicts, including those originating from
border disputes, should be resolved by peaceful means
and in compliance with international law and the
Charter of the United Nations. We also hold that the
international community should be cautious about
imposing further sanctions, with a view to avoiding
undesired adverse impacts on humanitarian activities
and the livelihoods of the people of Eritrea.

The Council should keep the situation under
constant review for possible modification or lifting of
sanctions measures in the light of positive
developments on the ground.
