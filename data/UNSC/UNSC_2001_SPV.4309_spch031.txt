Mr. Guehenno: There were a few questions still
to be answered. In fact, I forgot to answer a question
on Montenegro that was put by the delegation of
Norway. I do not want to prejudge the outcome of the
elections and the future path that Montenegro will take.
When I was in Kosovo, I heard very conflicting
assessments of what that impact would be. I am sorry
to have an answer that is more a question than an
answer, but I think that is the honest status of our
thinking at the moment on that impact.

Ukraine raised the question of how the agreement
with Belgrade was developing. What is now under
negotiation is a Status of Mission Agreement between
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia authorities and the
liaison office of the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). I am
pleased to say that we heard after the meeting between
President Kostunica and the Special Representative of
the Secretary-General that such a meeting should be
concluded very soon; it will help address both
substantive issues that we have discussed this morning
and also very practical issues relating to the
establishment of that office in Belgrade.

Ireland asked why there were still so many
Albanians detained in Serbia proper. The Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbian amnesty laws
covered political prisoners, but excluded those
sentenced under terrorism charges. The 400 prisoners
that the representative of Ireland referred to were
sentenced under such terrorism charges. I was pleased
to hear that President Kostunica has assured the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr.
Haekkerup, that that category of cases - and among
them is a particularly sensitive group called the
Djakovica group - will be dealt with soon. So that
should be resolved in the near future.

I think I will stop there for the sake of brevity.
