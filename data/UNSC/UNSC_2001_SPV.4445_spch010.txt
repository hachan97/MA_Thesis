Mr. Strommen (Norway): Let me congratulate
you, Mr. President, on the manner in which you have
conducted the work of the Security Council during the
month of December. I take this opportunity also to
express my delegation's appreciation for the
professionalism that you and your staff have displayed
during our year as fellow members of the Council. Let
me also say adieu to our other outgoing members -
Bangladesh, Jamaica, Tunisia and Ukraine - and to
say to them, "Thank you very much; we will miss

a,

you .

We welcomed the focus on African issues in
December and the open debates and briefings
concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
West Africa and Angola. We were also pleased with the
procedure applied on those occasions in terms of taking
duly into account the views expressed by non-members
before adopting important decisions. In particular, the
presidential statement concerning the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (S/PRST/2001/39) and the
extension of the mandate of the Panel of Experts on the
Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources and Other
Forms of Wealth of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo show that we stand to gain significantly
substantive inputs by not rushing to take decisions
without duly listening to the parties concerned and to
the wider membership of the United Nations.

Indeed, a main purpose of open meetings is to
provide for transparency and interactivity. We thus
advocate an end to the days when the Council adopted
decisions at open debates without setting aside time
fully to consider the inputs provided at such meetings.
We welcome your stewardship in that regard,
Mr. President.

Finally, let me once again state the Norwegian
view that brief interventions facilitate a businesslike
and interactive meeting culture in the Council.
