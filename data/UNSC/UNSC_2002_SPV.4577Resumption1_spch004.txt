Mr. Prendergast: I suppose that is the $64,000
question, Madam President. The first step towards
making a situation better is usually to acknowledge that
you have a problem and to be willing to accept internal
and external advice. We have been trying to do that.

We have been somewhat hampered because for a
while we have had no head of the United Nations
Peace-Building Office in Liberia. We have encountered
some difficulties in appointing a head. I hope that we
shall be able to overcome that obstacle soon, because
that will give us some leverage and enable us to
develop some traction. As I mentioned, we are aware
ofthe efforts that the subregion is putting into that. We
want to give maximum encouragement to the
neighbours.

Thirdly, I think we need to encourage the
elements within Liberian society who are looking for
an improvement in the situation and who are pressing
for national reconciliation. I am thinking here primarily
of the churches in Liberia and other elements of civil
society. Liberia is fortunate in that it has a vibrant civil
society, and I think they are making exactly the right
noises in pressing for dialogue and national
reconciliation. But there has to be a response from the
players within the country. I think it is also difficult to
dispute that an improvement in Liberia's relations with
its neighbours would also be a positive factor in
helping to stabilize the situation inside the country. In
fact, it is quite difficult to think of a major
improvement in internal stability unless there is some
improvement in those relations with the immediate
neighbours. Thank you, Madam President.
