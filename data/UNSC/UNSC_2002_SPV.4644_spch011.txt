Mr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): Syria voted in favour of the resolution based
on its concern to achieve international unanimity in
commitment to the principles of the United Nations
Charter and the resolutions of international legitimacy,
be they with respect to Iraq, the Palestinian cause or
the Arab-Israeli conflict.

Syria voted in favour of the resolution, having
received reassurances from its sponsors, the United
States of America and the United Kingdom, and from
France and Russia through high-level contacts, that it
would not be used as a pretext for striking against Iraq
and does not constitute a basis for any automatic
strikes against Iraq. The resolution should not be
interpreted, through certain paragraphs, as authorizing
any State to use force. It reaffirms the central role of
the Security Council in addressing all phases of the
Iraqi issue.

Syria has also received reassurances from the
permanent members of the Security Council that the
resolution strengthens the mandate of the international
inspectors; that it serves the objective of preserving
Iraq's sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability;
and that it will lead to a comprehensive solution of the
Iraqi issue.
