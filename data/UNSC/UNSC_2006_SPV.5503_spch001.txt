The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Israel and Lebanon, in which they
request to be invited to participate in the consideration
of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity
with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of
the Council, to invite those representatives to
participate in the consideration of the item, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

the members of the Council, I extend a warm welcome

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Mitri
(Lebanon) took a seat at the Council table.


The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Security Council is meeting pursuant to
the request contained in the letter dated 31 July 2006
