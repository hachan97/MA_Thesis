Mrs. ngu (Nigeria): I thank Under-Secretary-
General Feltman for his briefing.

We commend the collaborative work of the Dutch-
led international team of air safety investigators. They
have been very successful in rendering the preliminary
report on the downing of Flight MH-17 in spite of
the formidable challenges of a difficult security
environment. We believe that further investigation
into the crash will provide even greater insight into the
sequence of events leading to the accident and offer
a more conclusive outcome. That is essential for the
elimination of doubt and conjecture, and in our view,
will provide the basis for accountability and justice
in consonance with the provisions of resolution 2166
(2014).

More significantly, we encourage the parties to
be unrelenting in the search for a mutually acceptable
solution to the crisis in eastern Ukraine. With President
Poroshenko's concession of self-rule and amnesty to
the separatists, we are optimistic that the conditions
on the ground will improve sufficiently to enable a
thorough, transparent and unimpeded investigation.
What is required now is restraint and perseverance by
all parties concerned to advance the process to a logical
conclusion. That is what the international community
owes to the memory of the victims of the ill-fated
flight MH-17.
