Mr. Polyanskiy (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We have just supported a so-called technical
extension of the mandate of the United Nations
Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in
the Central African Republic for one month. Today the
Council has maintained unity on this issue, which is
very encouraging. For that to continue to be the case in
future, the French penholders will have to make major
additional efforts if they still want to revisit their initial
ambitious draft, which we have been discussing for the
past month.

That is quite easy to do. The starting point must
be an understanding that there is work in the Central
African Republic for all who genuinely want to help
the country finally get back on its feet, especially given
that France and our Western partners generally have
repeatedly told us that the Central African Republic is
not an area to be competed over but rather a platform
for collaborating on finding solutions that can extricate
the country from its crisis. Now we have to live up to
that premise and set aside reluctance based on past
experiences, egotism and parochial national interests.
Anyone who approaches the issue with good intentions
should have no hidden agendas or fear of competition.
Those are the principles that guide us. We are
proactively helping the Central African Republic with
the knowledge and support of the leadership and people
of the country, and we would like our efforts to be duly
reflected in the French draft.

The fact that the concerns of our United States
colleagues were meticulously and quickly addressed
inspires optimism. Since their views were heard, please
listen to ours as well. We are ready to continue to work
on the draft text in a spirit of mutual respect so that a
month from now, it will not be necessary to jeopardize
the unity of the Council, which is so important to us
and our friends in the Central African Republic, on the
topic we are discussing today.
