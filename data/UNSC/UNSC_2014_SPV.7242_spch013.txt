Mr. Ja'afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): The Security Council should call on various
States to fight this type of ideology and the individuals
who support it. That must be done in a very specific time
frame. We should focus on the language and rhetoric of
certain well-known media of countries of the Gulf and
through certain Takfiri websites that work to promote
extremist terrorist thought and to promote bloody
ideologies. We must place emphasis on the importance
of fighting such media and those who support it.
