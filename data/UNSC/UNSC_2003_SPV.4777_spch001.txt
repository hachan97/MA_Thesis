The President (spoke in Russian): I understand
that our respected colleague Ambassador Mamady
Traore, Permanent Representative of Guinea, is here
with us in this Chamber for the last time before he
undertakes his next important assignment.

On behalf of the members of the Security
Council, I wish to pay tribute to Ambassador Traore for
his invaluable contribution to the work of the Council.
His diplomatic skills, which were put to good use
during his presiding over the difficult deliberations of
the Council in the month of March, together with his
collegial approach, have made him a highly effective
representative of his country. I am certain that he will
continue to use his talents in his new assignment.
Ambassador Traore will be remembered as a colleague
who always strived to work in cooperation and
harmony with other members of the Council.

In bidding him a fond farewell, Council members
and I wish him great success and fulfilment in his
future endeavours.
