Mr. Verbeke (Belgium): This is my fifth 90-day
report to the Security Council, which I am delivering in
accordance with paragraph 18 of resolution 1737
(2006). The report covers the period 19 December
2007 to 17 March 2008, during which the Security
Council Committee established pursuant to resolution
1737 (2006) held no session of informal consultations,
but carried out its work outside the meeting room.

As members are aware, paragraph 5 of resolution
1737 (2006) stipulates that States shall notify the
Committee of the supply, sale or transfer of all items,
materials, equipment, goods and technology covered
by documents S/2006/814 and 8/2006/815, the export
of which to the Islamic Republic of Iran is not
prohibited by subparagraphs 3 (b), 3 (c) or 4 (a) of the
resolution. During the reporting period, the Committee
received three notifications from a Member State with
reference to that paragraph. All three notifications
related to the construction of the nuclear power plant in
Bushehr, Iran.

Paragraph 15 of resolution 1737 (2006) provides
for notifications by relevant States to the Committee of
the intention to make or receive payments or to
authorize the unfreezing of funds in connection with
contracts entered into prior to the listing of persons and
entities in the annexes to resolutions 1737 (2006) and
1747 (2007). The Committee received two such
notifications.

Paragraph 19 of resolution 1737 and paragraph 8
of resolution 1747 (2007) concern the submission by
all States of reports to the Committee on the
implementation of those two resolutions. Since I last
briefed the Council, the Committee has received one
additional report under both resolutions, bringing the
total number of reports under resolution 1737 (2006) to
88 and the total number of reports under resolution
1747 (2007) to 72.

During the reporting period, the Committee
received and responded to two written queries from
Member States requesting clarification on certain
aspects of the sanctions regime imposed by resolutions
1737 (2006) and 1747 (2007).

Finally, the Committee issued its annual report
for 2007 (S/2007/780) in accordance with the note by
the President of the Security Council of 29 March 1995
(S/1995/234).

Before concluding, let me note that, just two
weeks ago, by its resolution 1803 (2008) of 3 March,
the Security Council adopted additional measures
relating to Iran. These measures include broadening the
scope of the proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities
and nuclear weapons delivery systems-related
embargo; extension of the assets freeze to individuals
and entities listed in annexes I and III of the resolution
and expansion of the scope of that measure;
introduction of a travel ban on individuals listed in
annex II of the resolution as well as on any additional
persons designated by the Security Council or the
Committee; and, finally, extension of the travel
notification requirement to individuals listed in annex I
of the resolution as well as to any additional persons
designated by the Security Council or the Committee.

In addition, the Council called upon all States to
exercise vigilance in the areas of public provided
financial support for trade with Iran and of banking
with Iran, and, in accordance with States' national legal
authorities and legislation and consistent with
international law, in particular the law of the sea and
relevant civil aviation agreements, to inspect the
cargoes to and from Iran of aircraft and vessels, at their
airports and seaports, owned or operated by two
Iranian companies, provided that there were reasonable
grounds to believe that the aircraft or vessel was
transporting goods prohibited under resolutions 1737
(2006), 1747 (2007) or 1803 (2008). In cases when the
aforementioned inspection of cargoes is undertaken,
08-27224
the Council requires all States to submit to it within
five working days a written report on the inspection. I
note paragraph 14 of resolution 1803 (2008) in
particular, since it broadens the scope of the
Committee's mandate as set out in paragraph 18 of
resolution 1737 (2006), to also include the measures
imposed in resolutions 1747 (2007) and 1803 (2008).

I wish to assure the Council that the Committee
will continue to discharge its expanded mandate
carefully and will, in this context, remind all Member
States of the expectations of the Council regarding
national reporting on the implementation measures
under the three resolutions. The members of the
Committee will be meeting in informal consultations
tomorrow, with a view to considering adapting the
guidelines to the newly adopted resolution 1803 (2008)
and to address other questions in that regard.
