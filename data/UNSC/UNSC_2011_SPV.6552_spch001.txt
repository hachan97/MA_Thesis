The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them

draft resolution submitted by France, Germany, the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and the United States of America.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready

A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
Colombia, France, Gabon, Germany, India,
Nigeria, Portugal, Russian Federation, South
Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and United States of America

Abstaining:

The President (spoke in French): There were 14
votes in favour, none against and one abstention. The
draft resolution has been adopted as resolution 1984
(2011).

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements after the voting.
