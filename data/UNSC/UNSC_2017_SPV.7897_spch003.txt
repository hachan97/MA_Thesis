The President: I thank Mr. O'Brien very much
indeed for his briefing.

I shall now give the floor to the members of the
Security Council.

Before doing so, I thank Council members in the
main for their timekeeping this morning. Again this
afternoon the light will start flashing if representatives
do not finish their statements within the five minutes,
and, ifnecessary, I will use the gavel to encourage them.

I give the floor to the representative of the Russian
Federation, who called this meeting.
