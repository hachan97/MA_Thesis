Mr. Kalomoh (Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs): The draft annual report of the
Security Council for the period 16 June 2001 to 31 July
2002, to be submitted to the General Assembly in
pursuance of Article 24, paragraph 3, of the United
Nations Charter, has been prepared by the Secretariat,
in line with the revised format agreed upon by the
Security Council in 2002.

The format of the draft report before the Council
provides a guide to the activities of the Council in a
concise manner. In this connection, I would like to note
that this is the first report prepared in accordance with
the provisions of the Note by the President of the
Council of 22 May 2002, which is contained in
document S/2002/l99, which were aimed at enhancing
the quality of the report and accommodating the views
expressed on the previous format.

Of particular interest is the introduction to the
report, which contains an analytical summary of the
work of the Council for the period covered by the
report.
The draft report was circulated by me on 9
September 2002, in my capacity as Assistant Secretary-
General for Political Affairs, to the current Members of
the Security Council and to the members whose terms
of office expired on 31 December 2001 for review and
comment, if any.

A corrigendum containing a change requested by
one Council Member is also before the Council.
