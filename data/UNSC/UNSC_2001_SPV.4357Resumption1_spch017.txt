The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the
representative of Bahrain for his remarks to the
presidency.
The next speaker inscribed on my list is
Ambassador Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla, Acting
Chairman of the Committee on the Exercise of the
Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People. I invite
him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his
statement.
