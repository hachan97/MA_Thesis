Mr. Mansour (Palestine): I will be very short. We
are interested in peace. We also consider the building
of settlements and declaring Jerusalem the capital of
the State of Israel, and not an occupied territory, to be
unilateral illegal actions condemned by everyone here,
who also demand that Israel stop illegal settlement
activities - because they are illegal - and to implement
Council resolutions that state that the unilateral, illegal
action of annexing Jerusalem is not acceptable.

For us, we are exercising our legal right to join
treaties and conventions. We are doing it peacefully.
We are doing it diplomatically. We are doing it legally.
Even when we join the International Criminal Court
(ICC) to go after those who committed crimes against
our people, we are taking an action that it is our right to
take. It is legal. It is civilized.

Why is Israel afraid of us exercising our right?
Why does Israel call it "unilateral", when it is the
one that is acting unilaterally and illegally? In Arabic
literature we have a very famous saying: people
who live in glass houses should not throw stones.
We do not need those who are buried to their ears
in illegal behaviour - settlements, the blockade of
the Gaza Strip, the unilateral action with regard to
Jerusalem - to lecture us that they do not want us to
so-called "unilaterally" act on something on which it is
our legal right to act.

We came to the General Assembly, which recognized
the State of Palestine. It changed our status. It opened
doors for us to defend ourselves peacefully, legally,
diplomatically. Why is it a unilateral action when we
exercise our right - our legal, peaceful, civilized,
diplomatic right - to defend ourselves in a better way?
If the Israeli leaders think they are not doing anything
wrong, why are they afraid of our going to the ICC in
order to go after those who are committing illegal acts
against us?

I apologize for taking the floor for the third time.
