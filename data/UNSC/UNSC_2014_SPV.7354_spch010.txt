Mrs. ngu (Nigeria): Nigeria believes in the
critical role of the Security Council in seeking a
comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle
East, based on Security Council resolutions, the Madrid
principles of land for peace, the road map for peace in
the Middle East, and the Arab Peace Initiative. We are
convinced that the collective action of the Council is
critical in advancing and expediting the peace process,
and serves as the most important catalyst in ending the
protracted conflict.

Nigeria's perspectives on the question of Palestine
have been consistently guided by its position regarding
the rule of law and respect for the principles of
international law and justice. We have an abiding respect
for the legitimacy of the aspirations of the Palestinian
people to self-determination, independence and dignity.
That is why we encourage both sides to demonstrate
greater flexibility in their long-term strategic interests.
Indeed, there is no alternative to a two-State solution,
with Israel and Palestine living together side by side
in peace, stability and security. Nigeria remains very
supportive of the right of the Palestinian people to self-
determination, independence and dignity. We are also
mindful of the need to guarantee Israel's security and
existence as a sovereign State. It is for that reason that
we support the comprehensive discussion of all final
status issues.

The ultimate path to lasting peace lies in the
negotiated solution, and the time is ripe for both sides
to return to the peace talks.
