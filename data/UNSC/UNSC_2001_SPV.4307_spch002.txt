Sir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): I
want to break with tradition, Mr. President, since you
will not be present with us next week, and to express
the Council's pleasure at having you preside over our
formal meetings during the month of March, as our
colleague and as a close friend of all of us around the
table. It has given us delight to have you among us and
leading us with such clarity, calmness and wisdom
during the month of March. I wish to congratulate you
on that, Mr. President, on behalf of all the other
members of the Council, and to wish to you all good
fortune upon your return to your capital.
