Mr. Varli (Turkey): I did not intend to take the floor once again and I am actually very sorry that I have had to do so. I believe that the statement of representative of the Syrian regime is lowering the standard in this Chamber to a very disappointing level. I would merely like to make that point and note that our prior statement remains valid. I will not otherwise dignify the representative of the Syrian regime with a response. The meeting rose at 5.05 p.m.
