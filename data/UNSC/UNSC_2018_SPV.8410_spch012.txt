Mr. Tenya (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): We are
grateful for the convening of this meeting and the
briefing given by Ms. Rosemary DiCarlo.

Peru is deeply concerned by the recent incident
in the Kerch Strait and its potential repercussions
for the complex and unstable relations between the
Russian Federation and Ukraine, and for regional
stability. We regret the recent escalation and greater
tensions between the countries. In accordance with the
Charter of the United Nations, Peru reiterates the need
to respect the independence, territorial integrity and
sovereignty of Ukraine. We call on the parties, both
of which are represented here, to act with restraint,
avoid further escalation and always act in pursuant
of international law and the principle of the peaceful
settlement of disputes.
