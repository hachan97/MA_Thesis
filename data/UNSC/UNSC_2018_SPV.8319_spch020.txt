The President (spoke in Spanish): Before we
adjourn this meeting, I should just like to say - and I
am sure that I am speaking on behalf of all the members
of the Council - that we thank the Vice-President for
his pivotal, key, decisive and personal role in all the
progress made in the peace process in Colombia. We
thank him very much.

(spoke in English)

There are no more names inscribed on the list
of speakers.
I now invite Council members to informal
consultations to continue our discussion of the subject.

The meeting rose at 4.50 pm.
