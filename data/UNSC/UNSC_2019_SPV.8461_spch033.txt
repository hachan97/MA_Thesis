Mr. Apakan: The question that has been raised
has been handled in the daily and weekly reports
of the Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
And if one goes through those SMM. reports one can
observe accounts ofillegal activities, fighting, shelling
and other ceasefire violations. In that regard, I would
not like to make any comments here that would go
beyond the scope of our reports, because the reports
are based on established facts, and our teams are
patrolling, monitoring and producing reports. That
is the reason why instead of making a concrete and
tangible observation here, I would like to refer to the
reports of the SMM. In that respect, we have received
reports of people in uniforms, claiming to be from
the Russian Federation and other countries, as well
as mercenaries. The Special Monitoring Mission has
reported its observations of vehicles bearing Russian
flags, but has not identified their origin.

I have to say that, in order to avoid any
misunderstanding, there has been no reference in these
reports to military units. I am referring to reports and
not making any personal observation or judgment.
These are the elements that we have reported over
the course of four or five years. They are nothing
new and have been reiterated on several occasions by
the Mission.

The meeting rose at 5.50 p.m.
