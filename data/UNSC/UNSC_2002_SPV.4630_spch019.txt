The President (spoke in French): I thank the
Minister for Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation
and Francophonie of Equatorial Guinea for his kind
words addressed to me.

The next speaker on my list is the representative
of Denmark. I invite her to take a seat at the Council
table and to make her statement.
