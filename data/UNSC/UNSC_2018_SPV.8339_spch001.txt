The President: As this is the first public meeting
of the Security Council for the month of September, I
should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute, on
behalf of the Council, to Her Excellency Ambassador
Karen Pierce, Permanent Representative of the United
Kingdom, for her service as President of the Council
during the month of August. I speak for all members
in thanking not only Karen but also Jonathan and the
entire delegation on a job well done.

Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.

Implementation of the note by the President of the
Security Council (S/2017/507)

The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the
representative of the United States.

All Security Council members should have
the provisional programme of work, which was
circulated. I have always believed in transparency and
that everything we do should be in the open. I know
from the breakfast meeting this morning that there
were some concerns, or issues, with the provisional
programme of work. I felt that, rather than explaining it
to one another, members could each openly say, in their
national capacity, whether there are any issues with
the provisional programme of work, or whether we can
continue by consensus. I wanted to at least allow each
delegation to say it in its own voice instead of having
it said on its behalf. I hope that this will be the start of
continued transparency. I think we have come a long
way in the past couple of years in terms of making
sure all Council meetings are open meetings. During
the United States presidency, every meeting will be an
open meeting. We hope that all members will respect
that and consider continuing that policy during their
presidency as well.

I now resume my functions as President of the Council.

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements.
