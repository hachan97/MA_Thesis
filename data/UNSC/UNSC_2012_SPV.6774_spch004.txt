Mr. Loulichki (Morocco) (spoke in French):
Morocco voted in favour of resolution 2048 (2012)
because it sends a strong and unanimous message from
the Council calling for the restoration of peace and
stability in Guinea-Bissau. My country also voted in
favour in the light of its constant commitment to, and
particular interest in, peace, stability and the rule of
law in the western part of our continent, with which
Morocco has long-standing relations and multifaceted
partnerships.

When the crisis in Guinea-Bissau began,
Morocco was among the first countries to condemn the
coup d'etat and call for a return to the constitutional
order and for the release of those imprisoned as
political prisoners following the coup, as well as for
full respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms.

My delegation also voted for the resolution
because of the support it provides for international and
regional efforts in Guinea-Bissau. In that regard, we
especially support the sustained efforts and
commitments of the Economic Community of West
African States and other stakeholders involved in
resolving the crisis. We reiterate the need for
coordination in those mediation efforts.

In voting for the resolution, Morocco reiterates its
full readiness to support the efforts that have been
launched to ensure a return to stability. We will
continue to support such efforts, which we hope will
make it possible to reach a consensual and peaceful
political solution, in the interests of the people of
Guinea-Bissau.

Finally, I would like to acknowledge and
commend the political wisdom and sense of
compromise demonstrated by the delegations directly
concerned in order to arrive at a consensus text. That
can only strengthen the efforts of the international
community in helping to usher in a Guinea-Bissau that
is stable and at peace.
