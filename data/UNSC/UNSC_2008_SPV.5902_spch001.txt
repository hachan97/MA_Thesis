The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Australia, Canada, Denmark, Greece,
Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, the Republic of
Korea, Somalia and Spain, in which they request to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Duale
(Somalia) took a seat at the Council table; the
representatives of the other aforementioned
countries took the seats reserved for them at the
side of the Council chamber.

The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document 8/2008/351, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Australia, Belgium,
Canada, Croatia, Denmark, France, Greece, Italy,
Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Panama, the Republic
of Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland and the United States of America.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the
voting.
