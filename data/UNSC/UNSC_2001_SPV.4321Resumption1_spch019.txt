The President: I thank you for those remarks. I
also wish to thank Mr. Annabi and especially Mr.
Ramos-Horta and, through him, Mr. Gusmao, for their
presence here today. Your contributions certainly
enriched our discussion.

As I said before when speaking in my national
capacity and now say as President of the Council, I
think clear messages were sent today from the Council,
and I hope that those to whom they were addressed will
heed them and take them to heart. I think it is
appropriate also to say a word of appreciation on
behalf of the Council for the effort being made by
Sergio Vieira de Mello and by the troop contributors as
well in helping to deal with this situation.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 4.35 pm.
