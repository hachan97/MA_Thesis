The President (spoke in Russian): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Israel and Malaysia, in which
they request to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the discussion without the right to
vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Jacob
(Israel) and Mr. Zainuddin (Malaysia) took the
seats reservedfor them at the side of the Council
Chamber.
The President (spoke in Russian): The next
speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of
Pakistan. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table
and to make his statement.
