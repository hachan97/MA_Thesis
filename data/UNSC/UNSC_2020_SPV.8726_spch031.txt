Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): 1 say to Mr. Kyslytsya not to try to drive a wedge between me and Spokesperson Peskov. I saw his statement this morning. The information I referred to was not written at Sixty-seventh Street - where the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations is located - it is information we received today after the situation had been clarified. The meeting rose at 5.20 p.m.
