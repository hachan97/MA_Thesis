The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Japan and Norway, in which they
request to be invited to participate in the discussion of
the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with
the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the
Council, to invite those representatives to participate in
the discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Kobayashi
(Japan) and Mr. Brattskar (Norway) took the
seats reserved for them at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The President: In the absence of objection, I
shall take it that the Security Council agrees to extend
an invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Bernard Miyet, Under-Secretary-
General for Peacekeeping Operations.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Miyet to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on Ethiopia and Eritrea
(S/2000/785).

I should like to draw the attention of the members
of the Council to document S/2000/793, letter dated ll
August 2000 from Ethiopia.

I now give the floor to the Under-Secretary-
General for Peacekeeping Operations, Mr. Bernard
Miyet, to whom the Council has extended an invitation
under rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure.
