The President: I wish to remind all speakers to
limit their statements to no more than four minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements
are kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing
and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in
the Chamber. I would also like to appeal to all speakers
to deliver their statements at a reasonable speed so that
interpretation may be provided accurately.

I wish to inform all concerned that we will carry
on this open debate right through the lunch hour, as we
have a large number of speakers.

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Erlan
Idrissov, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan.
