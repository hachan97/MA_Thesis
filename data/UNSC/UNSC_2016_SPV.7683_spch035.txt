Mr. Gasso Matoses (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): We
have read the draft press statement from the Russian
Federation, and we agree with the representatives of the
United States and the United Kingdom. We are ready to
work on a text. However, it does not seem now as though
there is enough consensus in the Chamber to adopt the
draft press statement as it stands. It appears that there
might be agreement on the first paragraph, but not on the
entire draft press statement. For Spain, at this time, the
Security Council should have a constructive attitude. In
any circumstances, any statement that we issue should
favour a de-escalation, promote goodwill, advance
negotiations - while any action taken separately could
be counter productive.
