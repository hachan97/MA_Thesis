The President: There are no further speakers
inscribed on my list. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.

I take this opportunity, on behalf of the Security
Council, to thank Judge Pocar, Judge Mose, Prosecutor
Del Ponte and Prosecutor J allow for taking the time to
brief the Security Council.

The meeting rose at 1.30 p.m.
