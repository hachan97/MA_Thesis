Mr. Orrenius Skau (Sweden): The Committee
pursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999), 1989 (2011) and
2253 (2015) concerning the Islamic State in Iraq and
the Levant (ISIL) (Da'esh), Al-Qaida and associated
individuals, groups, undertakings and entities remains a
vital tool in our counter-terrorism efforts, and Sweden,
France, Kuwait, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the
United Kingdom welcome the adoption of presidential
statement S/PRST/2018/21, on the review of resolution
2368 (2017). We reiterate our strong support for the
mandate of the Ombudsperson of the ISIL (Da'esh)
and Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee, which is set out in
resolution 2368 (2017).

The institution of the Ombudsperson is of crucial
importance for due process, and therefore for the
efficiency of, and compliance with, the sanctions
regime. Respect for international due process standards
is key to all States Members of the United Nations for
the effective implementation of the Security Council's
sanctions measures. In that regard, we welcome the
continued discussions on how to ensure respect for due
process standards across sanctions regimes, allowing
for sufficient capacities to that end. We support
the Council's continued work on strengthening the
mandate of the Office of the Ombudsperson and we
stress the importance of safeguarding its independence,
preventing longer vacancies of the post and ensuring
transparency in the Ombudsperson's process.

We also encourage the Council to consider the
proposals put forward by the Group of Like-minded
States on Targeted Sanctions in its letter to the
Council on 7 December, during further discussions
on the continued evaluation of the implementation of
the measures.

The meeting rose at10.15 a.m.
