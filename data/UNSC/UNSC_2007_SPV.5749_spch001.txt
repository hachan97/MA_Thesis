The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council has agreed to extend an invitation under rule
39 of its provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Alpha
Oumar Konare, Chairperson of the African Union, to
whom I extend a very warm welcome. I am pleased to
see him here.

I am also pleased to welcome heads of State or
Government, ministers and other representatives
participating in this summit meeting of the Security
Council, together with the Secretary-General of the
United Nations, whom I welcome and whom I thank.

Following those of 1992, 2000 and 2005, this
summit meeting is the fourth of its kind to be held
since the establishment of the United Nations in 1945.
This demonstrates the great importance the Security
Council attaches to the African continent. Clearly, the
priority that the United Nations accords to Africa is
shared by France.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

I now invite the Secretary-General, His
Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, to take the floor.
