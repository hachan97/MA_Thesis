Mr. Alasania (Georgia): First of all, I would like
to address one question to my colleague, Ambassador
Churkin: Are you ready to stop the fighter jets that are
in the air, which will soon be bombing my comrades in
Georgia?

What will the Security Council do about this
now? How are we going to address this? We all know
that those bombers are in the air and that they are about
to bomb the civilian population indiscriminately, as
they have been doing for an entire 24 hours. What are
we going to do? That is my question to Council
members.
