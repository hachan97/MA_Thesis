The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2018/l60, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2018/133, which contains a note by the
Secretary-General concerning the date of an election to
fill a vacancy in the International Court of Justice.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
adopt the draft resolution before it without a vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The draft resolution has been adopted as resolution
2403 (2018).

The meeting rose at10.10 am.
