Mr. Stanislavov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): At the outset, I should like to welcome you,
Mr. President, to your responsible post and to
congratulate the former President of the Security
Council.

We are grateful to Mr. Morris for his very
informative and useful briefing. The critical food
situation in Africa definitely requires an immediate
reaction by the international humanitarian community,
in particular by the World Food Programme (WFP), the
main United Nations agency created especially to fight
starvation in the world. For its part, Russia intends to
continue to provide humanitarian assistance to African
countries and, as Mr. Morris said, has been providing
such assistance through WFP channels.

Overcoming the food crisis in African countries
is a comprehensive, multifaceted challenge. Many
efforts will be required to resolve armed conflicts and
to achieve sustainable development in the region,
including through eliminating poverty, promoting
better governance, overcoming the consequences of
natural disasters, helping to increase food production
and creating a stable market for food.

In that connection, I should like to ask the

Executive Director how the WFP - in addition to
providing humanitarian assistance in the form of
food - can help to resolve those key problems that

Africa faces? I understand that the WFP cannot resolve
those problems alone and that the efforts of all
international organizations and donors are required. It
is exceptionally important to coordinate international
assistance, and I think a role could be played in that
regard by the Economic and Social Council, which is
able to provide that kind of coordination.
