Mr. De Mistura: I will say just a few words,
simply to acknowledge the many positive, constructive
comments and the advice offered by each member of
the Security Council. We look forward to continuing to
report progress. There will be ups and downs: we know
it. But what we heard today will encourage both
Ambassador Al Bayati and me to continue on this road.
