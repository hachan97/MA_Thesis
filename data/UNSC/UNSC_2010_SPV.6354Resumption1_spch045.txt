Mr. Ziadeh (Lebanon): I take the floor to reply to
the statement made by the Israeli representative
regarding Security Council resolution 1701 (2006).

While reiterating its commitment to the full
implementation of resolution 1701 (2006), which, inter
alia, defines the role and mandate of the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, Lebanon would like
to underline the fact that Israel is the party that is not
abiding by its obligations under the resolution through
its daily violations of Lebanese sovereignty. These
violations have been documented in all of the
Secretary-General's reports on the implementation of
resolution 1701 (2006), the latest being that to be
discussed by this Council on 14 July.
