Mr. Yap (Singapore): We would like to thank the
High Representative, Lord Ashdown, and the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Klein, for
their comprehensive and useful briefings.

I would like to make two points. First, we support
Lord Ashdown's goal of preparing Bosnia and
Herzegovina for statehood within the European Union
and his having set the rule of law and jobs as his top
priorities. The rule of law is central to any society, not
least to one that has just emerged from conflict. Jobs
are an indicator of the state of a country's economy,
progress in which is important for the country's
viability and stability.

The next Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina
must therefore heed the call to act on implementing the
key reforms in the rule of law and making Bosnia work
agenda. The smooth running of the 5 October elections
by the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina is a
model for the new Government to emulate in going
about its business.

Secondly, we commend Mr. Klein and the United
Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH)
for the outstanding work they have done in reforming
the police sector. We reiterate the need for a smooth
transition from the International Police Task Force to the
European Union Police Mission at the end of this year.
The tangible and intangible gains made by UNMIBH in
all aspects of police reform should be built upon; none
should fall through the cracks during the process of
handing over.

Here, we have a question similar to that posed
earlier by the United States on whether there are any
particular problems with the transition.
