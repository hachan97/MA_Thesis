Mr. Allen (United Kingdom): I thank Ms. Mueller
and Ms. Mustapha for their answers to Ambassador
Pierce's questions. We have taken note of what they
said, and we will follow up on those points.

I believe the representative of Syria responded to
one of the three questions that we put to him. With
your permission, Mr. President, I would like to put the
other two questions to him once again, and I will repeat
them. I think almost every delegation here today raised
the issue of the situation in Rukban, and we just heard
from the Assistant Secretary-General that the United
Nations has learned from the Syrian authorities that it
is not possible for the United Nations to deliver its next
convoy. Could the Syrian representative explain to us
and to the Council why it is not possible? That is the
first question.

The second question is whether the Syrian
representative can give the Council a clear assurance
that the Syrian authorities will respect the ceasefire
that is in place in Idlib.
