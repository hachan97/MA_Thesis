Mr. Yelchenko (Ukraine) (spoke in Russian): To
show respect to my Russian colleague, Mr. Vassily

fabricated topic for today's meeting. I will be very brief.
The second statement delivered by Mr. Nebenzia Federation called 60 Minutes, with Olga Skabceva. But
bore out my gravest concerns, namely, that once again today's meeting is not a talk Show.
he has confused a Security Council meeting with a
talk show - a very popular talk show in the Russian The meeting rose at 12.10p.m..
