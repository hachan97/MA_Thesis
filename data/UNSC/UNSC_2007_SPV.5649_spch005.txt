The President: I thank Mr. Djinnit for his
briefing.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers
to limit their statements to no more than five minutes,
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate their texts in writing in
the Chamber and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking.

On behalf of the Security Council, I now extend a
warm welcome to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the
Congo, His Excellency Mr. Rodolphe Adada.
