The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of the
Sudan in which he requests to be invited to participate in
the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Erwa (Sudan)
took a seat at the Council table.

The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General pursuant to Security Council
resolution 1054 (1996), documents S/l996 541 and
Addenda l, 2 and 3.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/ 1996/664, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by Botswana, Egypt and Guinea-
Bissau.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to the following documents: S/1996/402,
S/ 1996/464 and S/ 1996/513, which contain letters dated 31
May, 24 June and 2 July 1996, respectively, from the
Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United
Nations addressed to the President of the Security
Council; and S/1996/538, letter dated 10 July 1996 from
the Permanent Representative of Ethiopia to the United
Nations addressed to the President of the Security
Council.

The first speaker on my list is the representative of
the Sudan, on whom I now call.
