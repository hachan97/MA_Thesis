The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank Mr.
Morris for his comments and his responses to questions
raised concerning the subject of this afternoon's
meeting. I should also like to thank him most
especially for his willingness to respond to questions
related to other items that were not on the agenda, in
particular the situation in Iraq.

In that connection, various countries members of
the Security Council have expressed interest in the
possibility that, in the near future, the Council might be
able to continue to engage in dialogue with Mr. Morris
on the situation in Iraq and on the role that the World
Food Programme will play. The presidency will consult
with other Council members and with Mr. Morris to
consider the possibility that, in the near future -
before his return to the Programme's headquarters in
Rome - he could meet in consultations with the
Council in that regard.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 5.10 pm.
