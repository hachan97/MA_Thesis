Mr. Briens (France) (spoke in French): I, too,
would like to welcome the Prime Minister of Libya and
to assure him of our full support in the current crucial
phase that his country is going through. I was not
planning to take the floor but since the representative
of the Russian Federation has done so, I will make a
statement.

The International Commission of Inquiry of the
Human Rights Council has submitted its report on
Libya (A/HRC/ 19/68), which is serious and
comprehensive. It is above all a damning report for the
forces of Al-Qadhafi that committed crimes against
humanity, torture and other degrading treatment.

With regard to NATO, as the representative of the
United States has just pointed out, the report concludes
that the alliance's campaign was very precise and
underlined its determination to avoid civilian losses
and the effectiveness of the very strict procedures
applied in the use of force. The truth is that, confronted
with an adversary that was directly attacking its
population and that did not hesitate to operate from
mosques, schools and hospitals, NATO showed great
restraint and was very discriminating in its use of
force.

Once the Commission was established, NATO
fully cooperated with it and sustained an open and
transparent dialogue. The information provided by
NATO is annexed to the Commission's report.
