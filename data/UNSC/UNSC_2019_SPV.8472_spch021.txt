Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I did not intend to engage in polemics with
my United States colleague. However, given that he has
taken the floor, I should like to make one remark and
pose one question.

With respect to whose rhetoric aligns more
closely to the Cold War, I have my own views on that.
Mr. Abrams was an active participant in the Cold War
and in a number of underground operations conducted
during the era of the Cold War, so we are not going
to discuss this issue. I think that Mr. Abrams has yet
to hear the views of other members of the Security
Council today, which will in one way or another align
with what I have said.

For some reason, he is under the impression that
the only thing that Russia is concerned about is the
money that it will not be able to get as a return on the
investment it has made in Venezuela. Why does it not
occur to him that we might have other considerations
besides commercial interests? We do not tolerate
the blatant, arrogant trampling of the principles of
international law and intervention in the domestic
affairs of other sovereign countries. We do not allow
anyone to take such liberties aimed at us or at other
countries, and yet we hear many accusations regarding
Russia's intervention in the affairs of other States,
including the United States of America. Given what the
United States is doing in Venezuela, the accusations of
the former are simply comical.
I do not wish to engage in rhetoric, because I am
aware of the unfortunate fact that we will not find
common ground on this issue. However, I want to
reiterate the following question: Does the United
States delegation stand ready to support elements to
the press on Venezuela using the wording proposed
by the Russian delegation, based on Security Council
elements to the press made with respect to Haiti?
The text is exactly the same; "Haiti" has simply been
replaced with "Venezuela". We will circulate the draft
text among Council members.
