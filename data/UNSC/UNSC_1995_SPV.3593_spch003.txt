The President: On behalf of the Council, I should
like to express appreciation to the Secretariat for the work
it has undertaken in preparing this factual and excellent
report, which corresponds to the Council's requirements.

Members of the Council have before them the draft
annual report of the Security Council to the General
Assembly for the period 16 June 1994 to 15 June 1995,
as circulated by the Assistant Secretary-General of the
Department of Political Affairs on 19 October 1995, and
corrigenda.
May I take it that the draft report is adopted by the
Council?

There being no objection, it is so decided.
This decision will be reflected in a note by the
President of the Security Council, to be issued as

document S/ 1995/948.

The Security Council has thus concluded its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 12.15 pm.
