Mr. Mahendran (Sri Lanka): Sri Lanka would
like to join other delegations in thanking you, Mr.
President, for convening this open debate on this issue
at the request of the Chairman of the Non-Aligned
Movement.

Since the adoption of Security Council resolution
1441 (2002), the inspectors of the United Nations
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission
and of the International Atomic Energy Agency have
submitted two reports - the first on 27 January and
the second on 14 February. The inspectors' first report
mentioned that Iraq had cooperated with the inspection
process but that that cooperation lacked substance. The
second report indicated an increased level of
cooperation on the part of Iraq, but also indicated that
vital questions remained unanswered and that Iraq had
not been fully complying with the resolution 1441
(2002). A few days ago Iraq acceded to some of the
inspectors' key request, including the interviewing of
Iraqi scientists and technicians without the presence of
Iraqi officials; allowing reconnaissance flights over
Iraqi territory by U-2 aircraft; and the issuance of a
presidential decree prohibiting the manufacture or
import of weapons of mass destruction. The inspectors'
third report to the Security Council is expected on 14
March 2003.

The Government of Sri Lanka fervently hopes
that Iraq fully complies in substance as well. We
believe that would help to avoid a major catastrophe
for Iraq's people and would avert a further escalation
of tension in the Middle East region.

Considering the human, political and economic
consequences of military intervention, the Government
of Sri Lanka calls for intensified and early completion
of ongoing United Nations and other diplomatic efforts
to ensure a peaceful solution to this question.
