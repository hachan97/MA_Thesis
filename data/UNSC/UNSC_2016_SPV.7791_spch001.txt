The President (spoke in Russian): In accordance
with rule 39 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure, I invite Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, Under-
Secretary-General for Political Affairs, to participate
in this meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2016/830, which contains the third
report of the Secretary-General on the threat posed
by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (Da'esh)
to international peace and security and the range of
United Nations efforts in support of Member States in
countering the threat.

I now give the floor to Mr. Feltman.
