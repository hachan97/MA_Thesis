Mr. Karev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian):
The Russian delegation abstained in the voting on
resolution 2081 (2012) for the following reasons.

It is obvious to us that there are serious systemic
problems in the work of the Tribunal that that body is
not dealing with by itself. The interminable trial delays,
along with the clear inability of the Tribunal to execute
its mandate, are too costly not only for some of the
accused, but also for the international community. In
particular, that situation leads to a heavier financial
burden for States Members of the United Nations.

The so-called "measures to enhance the efficiency
of trials" undertaken by the leadership of the Tribunal
have had the opposite effect. The systematic failure of
the leadership of the Tribunal to honour its promises
on deadlines for completing its work has definitely
undermined our confidence in that body.

In those circumstances, the need for urgent
measures to rectify the situation in the International
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) is,
in our opinon, beyond all doubt. Such a set of measures
was suggested by the Russian delegation at the stage
of preparing the resolution just adopted. In particular,
we suggested the speedy conduct of an independent
analysis of the legal and administrative activities of
the ICTY. That would have helped to understand the
nature of the insufficiencies and miscalculations in the
work of the Tribunal. With such objective information,
the Security Council would finally have been able to
proceed to develop practical steps to help the Tribunal
to fulfil resolution 1966 (2010). Unfortunately, for
reasons beyond our comprehension, that proposal did
not find a positive response among several Council
members and was not included in the final draft. That
did not allow us to support today's resolution.
