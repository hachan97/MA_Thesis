Mr. Dejammet (France) (spoke in French): One
representative has explained that he did not understand
how one could fail to take a position on such a resolution.

I feel that it is easy to understand in hearing the
dilemma described by that representative in expressing his
delegation's interest in humanitarian considerations and in
obtaining a six-month extension. At the same time,
however, his delegation supports pressure being exerted
by other members of the Council. Hence, his delegation
faced a dilemma.

 

It is precisely in order to avoid such dilemmas, which
give rise to unreasonable solutions, that I believe such a
resolution should not have been put to the vote. I should
like to point out that, in certain very rare cases, texts that
we know will not be implemented and therefore do not
enhance the Council's authority should not be put to the
vote. We must know how not to take a stand so as not to
participate in an exercise that, I might say, is materially
unworkable.
