Mr. Qin Huasun (China) (interpretation from Chinese): Iraq has been under sanctions for more than
seven years and the humanitarian there has continued to
deteriorate. The Chinese delegation expresses its deep
sympathy with the people of Iraq for their sufferings.

The draft resolution before us would approve an
increase in the amount of oil to be exported by Iraq and
would thereby increase the amount of humanitarian supplies
it can import. We believe that this would help to alleviate
the current humanitarian situation in Iraq. The Chinese
delegation will therefore vote in favour of the draft
resolution before us.

The oil-for-food programme should proceed on the
basis of full respect for the sovereignty of Iraq and be
implemented strictly in accordance with the memorandum
of understanding between the United Nations Secretariat
and the Government of Iraq. We hope that, once the draft
resolution is adopted, the parties concerned will actively
collaborate in its implementation. We hope that there will
be no linkage in the implementation process itself
between this humanitarian question and political issues.

We urge the parties concerned to expedite the review
and approval procedure and to avoid artificial delays in
order to ensure that the oil-export earnings are converted
into humanitarian supplies as soon as possible. In the
meantime, I wish to emphasize that the current plan is
merely a temporary measure for easing the humanitarian
situation in Iraq. A definitive solution to the humanitarian
crisis in Iraq lies solely in the gradual removal of the
sanctions against that country.

The Security Council is considering a draft
resolution on the humanitarian programme for Iraq on the
very day when the Secretary-General is arriving there for
diplomatic mediation. We sincerely hope that he will
achieve success in his visit.
