Mr. Karsgaard (Canada): Canada believes that only
through negotiation can a just, lasting and comprehensive
peace be achieved, based on Security Council resolutions
242 (1967) and 338 (1973). The agreement signed
between the Government of Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) on 15 January, leading to
the redeployment of Israeli forces from Hebron, was
welcomed by Canada as an important step towards
restoring momentum and confidence in the peace process.

Canada believes that the construction of a lasting
peace requires that all parties refrain from unilateral
actions that would prejudge the outcome of final status
negotiations. In this regard, it is Canada's view that the
recent decision of the Government of Israel to proceed
with the construction of an Israeli settlement in Har Homa
' undermines the trust that is the very foundation of the
peace process. While we acknowledge the stated
commitment of the Israeli Government to issue new
building permits for Arabs in East Jerusalem, this neither
justifies the construction of an Israeli settlement in
occupied territories nor lessens its impact on the peace
process.

Canada views settlement activity as a violation of
international law and harmful to the peace process. We
call upon the Government of Israel to reconsider its
decision to resume settlement activity in the West Bank

and East Jerusalem and to refrain from building housing for
Israelis in Har Homa and elsewhere in the occupied
territories.

On 27 September, Canada's Foreign Minister
addressed the Security Council during its debate on
resolution 1073 (1996). As we consider the issue before
us today, Minister Axworthy's comments then bear
repeating now: Building lasting peace requires building
trust.
