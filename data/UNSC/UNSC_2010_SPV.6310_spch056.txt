The President (spoke in Arabic): I shall now
make a statement in my national capacity.

Lebanon considers it unfortunate that certain
States have misused today's debate and diverted it from
its original focus on the work of Committees, which is
mostly technical in nature. In that regard, we condemn
today's reference to Hizbullah - a Lebanese party
represented in my country's Government - in the
context of issues pertaining to terrorism. More
important, the delegation that made that reference
practices occupation and continues to commit
aggression against its neighbours, which confirms
something that my delegation has always stressed: the
need to differentiate between terrorism and the
legitimate right of nations to resist foreign occupation.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 2.25 p.m.
