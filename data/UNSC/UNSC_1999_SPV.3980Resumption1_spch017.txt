The President: Four countries have asked to speak
in what used to be called the right of reply. They are Iraq,
the United States, the United Kingdom and the Russian
Federation.

Members of the Council will be well aware that we
are at the moment keeping waiting two ministerial
delegations of Member States that had asked to meet with
us under the Arria formula, and I am much mindful of
our need to get on with that important commitment. That
said, I recognize, of course, the rights of members to seek
the floor again.

As the representative of Iraq wishes to address the
Council after the United States and the United Kingdom,
I will give the floor to the representative of the United
States.
