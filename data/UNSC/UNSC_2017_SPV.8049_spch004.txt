Mr. Rosselli (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): The
adoption of a resolution by the Security Council is in no
way extraordinary. What is extraordinary today is the
peace process that the Colombian people are pursuing.
This is a real example to the world of commitment to
peace undertaken by leaders who once were in conflict
with one another, and which has culminated in the full
integration into the political system of Colombia of the
former Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia.
That is an absolutely extraordinary development in the
history of peacemaking.

My colleagues have also just underscored the fact
that the most difficult stages lie ahead. What is equally
extraordinary is the support that the Security Council
is providing to the Colombian people. The United
Nations is committed to and standing shoulder to
shoulder with Colombia in this peacemaking process.
We are full of hope following the recent announcement
of the ceasefire recently signed by the Government of
Colombia with the National Liberation Army, which
suggests that we will soon be seeing the extinction of
the few flames that continue to smolder.

We extend our congratulations to the Secretary-
General, his Special Representative and the entire
United Nations team in Colombia for the admirable
work they are undertaking. Of course, we warmly
congratulate the dear people of Colombia.
