Mr. Shen Guofang (China) (Spoke in Chinese): The
Chinese delegation attaches great importance to Tuvalu's
desire to join the United Nations and has seriously
considered its application. The Chinese delegation believes
that, as a State Member of the United Nations, a country
should truly fulfil the obligations contained in the Charter
of the United Nations and strictly abide by the resolutions
of the General Assembly. This is also a very important
basis on which to judge whether an applicant country has
met the standards for being a Member of the United
Nations.

In considering the question of Tuvalu's joining the
United Nations, we believe that the most important thing
is the upholding of the principles and purposes of the
Charter of the United Nations and the implementation of
General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI).

Proceeding from this principled position, the Chinese
delegation cannot support the Security Council's
recommendation to the General Assembly that Tuvalu
should be accepted as a new Member State.

At the same time, bearing in mind the long-term
interests of the peoples of China and Tuvalu, and also
taking into consideration the requests of various parties,
including the countries of the South Pacific, we will not
block this recommendation. It is our hope that, after
joining the United Nations, Tuvalu will strictly abide by
the Charter of the United Nations and implement General
Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI).
