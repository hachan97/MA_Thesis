The President: May I note that, while the Minister
of Health of Uganda has been here with us in New York,
President Clinton's special adviser for AIDS, Sandy
Thurman, is in his country today meeting with his
colleagues and President. We are therefore most grateful
that he is here today.

The next speaker is the Minister of Health and Child
Welfare of Zimbabwe. I invite him to make his statement.
