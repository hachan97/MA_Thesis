Mr. Clay (United Kingdom): The United Kingdom welcomes the adoption of resolution 2507 (2020). I would like to begin by thanking France for its efforts to secure the Council's consensus on the resolution and for its inclusive approach to the negotiations. We regret that, despite the considerable effort of the penholder, consensus could not be reached and the Council was obliged to agree on a renewal period of only six months. We believe that six months is too short to allow for the effective implementation of the resolution and sends the wrong signal to the armed groups targeted by the resolution. I would like to be set out the position of the United Kingdom on the arms embargo. The arms embargo is designed to prevent weapons from reaching armed groups, not from reaching the Government of the Central African Republic. The notification and exemption procedures, as set out in the resolution, are the mechanisms through which the defence and security forces of the Central African Republic can access all the arms and equipment that they need to perform their role. To claim otherwise risks giving a false impression that adjusting or lifting the arms embargo will necessarily make the Central African Republic defence forces better able to protect the citizens of the country. The United Kingdom welcomes the commitment of the Government of the Central African Republic and the progress made since April towards the five benchmarks agreed by the Council in the areas of security sector reform, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and weapons and ammunition management. Progress on weapons management, in particular, is vital to ensure that weapons intended for the Central African Republic defence and security forces do not fall into the hands of armed groups. We encourage the Government of the Central African Republic to continue its efforts. It has our full support.
