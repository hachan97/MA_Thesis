Mr. Zlauvinen: The Director General of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),
Mr. ElBaradei, has asked me to read out the following
statement in connection with the draft resolution
contained in document S/2007/390, dated 28 June
2007:

"I recall my report to the Security Council
of 7 March 2003, in which I informed the Council
that the IAEA had found no evidence or plausible
indication of the revival of a nuclear weapons
programme in Iraq.

The detailed knowledge of Iraq's capabilities that
IAEA experts had accumulated since 1991, combined
with the rights provided under the relevant Security
Council resolutions, the active commitment by all
States to help us fulfil our mandate and an increased
level of Iraqi cooperation would have enabled the
Agency to provide the Security Council with an
objective and thorough assessment of Iraq's nuclear-
related capabilities within a few months.

"I also informed the Council at that time
that the IAEA would endeavour to evaluate Iraq's
capabilities on a continuous basis as part of our
long-term monitoring and verification
programme, in order to provide the international
community with ongoing and real-time
assurances.

"As I have reported in my consolidated
progress reports on the IAEA's verification
activities pursuant to the relevant Security
Council resolutions, the IAEA has not been able,
since 17 March 2003, to implement its Security
Council mandate in Iraq and has only been able
to verify, in accordance with Iraq's safeguards
agreement under the Treaty on the Non-
proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the remaining
nuclear material in Tuwaitha in each of the years
from 2003 to 2006.

"Once the security situation permits, with
the cooperation of the Government of Iraq and
through the full implementation of its safeguards
agreement, as well as an additional protocol
thereto that the IAEA hopes Iraq will conclude in
the near future, the Agency will be able to

provide assurances of the non-diversion of
declared nuclear material and the absence of
undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iraq.

"Finally, let me express my appreciation for
the support provided by the Council to the
Agency throughout the difficult 12 years of its
work in dismantling Iraq's clandestine nuclear
programme and in providing assurance that it was
not revived.

"I would also like to put on the record, on
behalf of all Agency staff, our gratitude for the
recognition given to the Agency and its dedicated
staff."
