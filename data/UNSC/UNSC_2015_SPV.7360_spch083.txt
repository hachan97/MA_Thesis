Mr. Nitzan (Israel): I would like to reply to the
statement made just now by the representative of
Saudi Arabia. If we are talking about the situation in
the Middle East, we cannot ignore the Saudi Wahabi
radicalism that is at the heart of Middle East terrorism.
Saudi Arabia supports, finances and supplies arms to
terrorist organizations in the region, and not only in the
region. The terrorist organizations in Africa that have
been mentioned earlier today - Al-Shabaab in Somalia
and Boko Haram - are all born and sponsored out of
Saudi radicalism.
