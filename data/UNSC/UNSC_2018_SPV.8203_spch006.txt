Mr. Ndong Mba (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in Spanish): The Republic of Equatorial Guinea has
learned of the attack involving the use a chemical nerve
agent in Salisbury, United Kingdom, and we hope that
events such as those will be duly investigated, that the
results of those investigations will be made public, and
that those responsible will face justice.

With regard to the accusations concerning the
involvement of the Russian Federation in the incident
reported by the Government of the United Kingdom,
Equatorial Guinea hopes that both parties, the
United Kingdom and the Russian Federation, will be
able to address and resolve the situation in the most
appropriate way possible through direct contact and by
fully clarifying the facts. That is why we recommend
that while the investigations are being carried out,
both parties - the Russian Federation and the United
Kingdom - demonstrate moderation. We invite both
parties to work closely on the investigations being
conducted to shed light on the situation. We thank the
United Kingdom for its initiative to invite independent
and volunteer investigators to carry out the analyses
necessary to resolve this complex situation.

In conclusion, I would like to make it clear that the
Republic of Equatorial Guinea is completely opposed
to the production, stockpiling, distribution and use of
chemical, biological, bacteriological and other similar
products on human beings, which are at variance
with the relevant international treaties. We therefore
condemn such use regardless of its perpetrators. We
wish Mr. Sergei Skripal, his daughter and others who
were affected by the incident a speedy recovery.
