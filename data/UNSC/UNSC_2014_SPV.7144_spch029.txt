Mr. Araud (France) (spoke in French): I believe that
we cannot talk nonsense here and that we cannot let the
representative ofthe Russian Federation lecture us to the
effect that Russia has made proposals intended to settle
the conflict. In reality, Russia's proposals are simple.
What is mine is mine - that is to say, Crimea - and
we can negotiate on what is yours - that is to say,
Ukrainian sovereignty. That is the Russian proposal.
The Russian keep repeating that they are ready to talk
about whatever is left of Ukraine, but Crimea is over.
We say no; let us be clear. On such bases, we cannot
have a dialogue founded on international legal order.
We did not reject the Russian proposal. Quite simply,
we rejected any proposal that boils down to forcing us
to accept the annexation of Crimea. It is simple. We
are ready to negotiate on the basis of international law.
International law means the territorial integrity of
Ukraine.
