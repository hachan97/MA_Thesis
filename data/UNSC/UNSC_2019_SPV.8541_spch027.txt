Mr. Schulz (Germany): I should just like to
comment very briefly on a statement made by our
Russian colleague. I want to register the fact that I
found his remarks on the European Union, NATO and
States that support Kosovo, as well as on the history
of the conflict in 1998 and 1999, to be unfortunate,
particularly unhelpful and partially insulting. I do not
want to descend to that level and will therefore refrain
from commenting in detail.

The meeting rose at 1.25 pm.
