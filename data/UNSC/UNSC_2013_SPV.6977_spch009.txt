The President: I thank Mr. Jallow for his briefing.

I remind Council members of the Council's
agreement in note 507 of July 2010 (S/2010/507) that
they should keep their interventions to five minutes or
less. As a number of Council and non-Council members
are participating in today's debate, I shall monitor
implementation of that agreement closely.

I shall now give the floor to members of the
Security Council.
