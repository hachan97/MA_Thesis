Mr. Traore (Guinea) (spoke in French): Like
preceding speakers, I should like to extend to the
representatives of Pakistan and Afghanistan the sincere
condolences of my delegation on the air crash that took
the life of the Afghan Minister for Mines and Industry
and a number of Pakistani officials.

I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General
Guehenno, Ambassador Nishimura of Japan and
Ambassador Braun of Germany for their very useful
briefings this morning. I especially thank Germany and
Japan, together with other countries, for their important
role in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.

I have one question for Mr. Nishimura with
regard to opium production. If I understood correctly,
opium production in 2002 amounted to $1.2 billion -
an amount equal to more than half of international aid
expected for Afghanistan. Given that that aid is slow in
coming, I want to ask Mr. Nishimura what concrete
steps he thinks must be taken to combat that scourge
effectively. If opium production is not curbed, it will
compromise the chances of getting the country on
track. Everyone is aware of the damaging
consequences of opium and other drugs in general. I
believe that it is very important to formulate measures
to curb the massive production of opium in
Afghanistan.
