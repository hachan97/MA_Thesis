The President (spoke in Russian): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Lebanon, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Salam
(Lebanon) took a seat at the Council table.

The President (spoke in Russian): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Terje Roed-
Larsen, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the
implementation of Security Council resolution 1559
(2004).

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Reed-Larsen to take a seat at the
Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2009/218, which contains the ninth semi-
annual report of the Secretary-General to the Security
Council on the implementation of Security Council
resolution 1559 (2004).

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Terje Roed-Larsen, Special Envoy for
2
the implementation of Security Council resolution
1559 (2004). I now give the floor to Mr. Roed-Larsen.
