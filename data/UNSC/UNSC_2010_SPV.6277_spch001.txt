The President (Spoke in French): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Antonio Maria
Costa, Executive Director of the United Nations Office
on Drugs and Crime.

It is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of Council
members to document S/2010/94, which contains a
letter dated 17 February 2010 from the Permanent
Representative of France addressed to the Secretary-
General, transmitting a concept paper on the item. The
presidency of the Council would like to draw the
Council's attention to this excellent document.

I welcome the presence of the Secretary-General,
His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, and invite him to
take the floor.
