I thank Special Envoy Pedersen and Ms. Wafa Mustafa for their briefings. It is positive to hear that the ceasefire in Idlib largely holds. But, like other Council members, we are concerned about the continued sporadic violence in the north-west of Syria. Only last week, we witnessed an attack on a Russian-Turkish joint patrol, as well as a car bomb explosion in Bab Al-Salam, which killed at least five people. The perpetrators of such crimes must be held accountable. Looking at the political situation, we see new setbacks. Unfortunately, the conflict of nine years is far from over. Rebuilding and unifying the country remains a challenge, as Damascus makes unilateral moves that undermine a political settlement. Over the weekend, the Syrian Government organized elections in government-controlled areas. However, Syrian citizens in opposition-held areas and abroad were unable to participate in the so-called elections. In other words, millions of Syrian citizens were denied their right to freely express their political will in fair elections. That act clearly violates the political road map set out in resolution 2254 (2015). As such, the international community will not recognize those or any other elections until a credible political transition is under way in Syria. Unfortunately, to this day, Damascus is not genuinely interested in the political process, even if there is agreement on the holding of Constitutional Committee meetings. Instead, the Syrian Government continues to use force against its own population. The torture of arbitrarily detained people is a perfect example of that brutal approach. Ms. Mustafa gave us detailed descriptions of the situation of detainees in overcrowded Syrian prisons, which further convinced us of the seriousness of the problem. Estonia demands the immediate, unilateral release of arbitrarily detained Syrians, especially women and minors.
