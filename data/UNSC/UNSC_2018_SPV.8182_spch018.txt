Mr. Zhang Dianbin (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China would like to thank Special Representative Toure
and Ambassador Vieira, Chair of the Guinea-Bissau
configuration of the Peacebuilding Commission, for
their briefings. The situation in Guinea-Bissau has
been generally stable in recent months, but it will still
require all the parties to work together to meet each
other halfway ifthey are to resolve the political impasse
peacefully and as soon as possible.

China hopes that the parties in Guinea-Bissau
will consider the country's interests, intensify their
dialogue and communication in order to bridge
differences quickly, implement the Conakry Agreement
as soon as possible, form an inclusive Government
and resume nation-building efforts. Meanwhile, the
international community should continue to follow
the situation in Guinea-Bissau. China will continue to
support the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding
Office in Guinea-Bissau in exercising its good offices
and conducting mediation efforts under Mr. Toure's
leadership, with the aim of coordinating international
support for Guinea-Bissau, promoting political
dialogue and advancing the country's economic and
social development.

The international community should continue to
support regional and subregional organizations such
as the African Union, the Economic Community
of West African States and the Community of
Portuguese-speaking Countries in their role as
mediators, while maintaining respect for the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Guinea-Bissau
and supporting the countries of the region in settling
African issues through African means.
