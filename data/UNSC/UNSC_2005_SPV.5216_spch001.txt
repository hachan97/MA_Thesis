The President (spoke in French): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Luis Moreno-
Ocampo, Prosecutor of the International Criminal
Court.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Moreno-Ocampo to take a seat at the
Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them a letter
dated 31 January 2005 from the Secretary-General
addressed to the President of the Security Council
(8/2005/60) transmitting the report of the International
Commission of Inquiry on Darfur to the Secretary-
General pursuant to resolution 1564 (2004).

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Luis Moreno-Ocampo, Prosecutor of
the International Criminal Court. I now give him the
floor.
