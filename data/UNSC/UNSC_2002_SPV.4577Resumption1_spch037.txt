The President: I think one of the things that we
in the European Union will also need to focus on is
continuing, and perhaps enhancing, the support that we
give to regional structures, and to the institutional side
of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) in particular, because they must get
resources from somewhere to build a further capacity
to be able to do the things that General Diarra was
talking about earlier. I think the European Union is a
prime partner with ECOWAS for that purpose.
