The President (spoke in French): I will now
make a statement in my capacity as Permanent
Representative of France.

France voted against the request presented by Mr.
Jovanovic', to participate in this Security Council
meeting. We believe that Mr. Jovanovie's participation
in this meeting is inappropriate. We do not dispute the
general principle of Mr. Jovanovie's having an
opportunity to participate in a Security Council
meeting. This vote is unrelated and has no effect on the
status of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the
United Nations, which is a matter of substance
governed by the relevant Security Council and General
Assembly resolutions.
I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.
