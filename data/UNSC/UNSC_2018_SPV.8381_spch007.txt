Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I would like to
make a statement on behalf of the United Kingdom,
C6te d'Ivoire, France, Kuwait, the Netherlands, Peru,
Poland, Sweden and the United States of America.

Mr. President, we have read carefully the letter
that you and other colleagues sent on 18 October
(S/2018/938). We have requested the Chair of the
United Nations fact-finding mission on Myanmar
to brief us today. The report produced by the
Mission (A/HRC/39/64) is the most authoritative and
comprehensive account of the human rights violations
that have occurred in the country since 2011. It details
in particular the events that took place in Rakhine state
on and around 25 August 2017 and led to the forcible
displacement of more than 725,000 refugees across an
international border into Bangladesh.

As we will hear, the Fact-Finding Mission's
findings are of the gravest nature. The report concludes
that "gross human rights violations" and "serious
violations of international humanitarian law" have
been committed in Myanmar since 2011 and that many
of these violations "undoubtedly amount to the gravest
crimes under international law".

It makes a specific recommendation to the Security
Council to ensure accountability for crimes under
international law committed in Myanmar. Ensuring
the prevention of such crimes - genocide, war crimes
and crimes against humanity - is one of the reasons
why the United Nations and the Security Council
were established in the first place. As members of the
Security Council, we are today faced with a situation
that clearly endangers international peace and security,
and also a specific request for the Council to act.
It is therefore absolutely without doubt the Security
Council's responsibility to hear the allegations
concerning the gravest crimes under international
law related to the situation and to deliberate on how
to proceed, and so we vote in favour of holding
this meeting.
