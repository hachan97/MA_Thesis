Mr. Monteiro (Portugal): Portugal voted in favour of
the draft resolution submitted by Egypt and Qatar.

I do not need to elaborate on the Portuguese position
on the decision of the Government of Israel to build a new
settlement in the J abal Abu Ghneim/Har Homa area of East
Jerusalem. My country co-sponsored the draft resolution
considered by the Security Council at its 3747th meeting
and the resolution adopted by the General Assembly.

We consider the Israeli decision to be illegal under
international law and a violation of the agreements reached
so far by the interested parties. Its overall effect on the
peace process is harmful.

We had hoped that this time the Council would have
been able to agree on a formula that would permit it to
assume its responsibilities and firmly to express its support
for the Middle East peace process. Unfortunately, we have
not been able to reach this stage, despite the efforts of
many delegations to achieve a consensus on this subject.

We condemn and regret the bombing attack that took
place today in Israel. Targeting innocent people is not the
right way to apply pressure or to solve disputes. The
current lack of confidence in the Middle East peace process
is being utilized by those who want to jeopardize the
achievements reached to date by the interested parties.

We urge Israel to reconsider and stop all actions that
create mistrust among the Palestinian and Arab peoples and
thereby risk alienating them from the negotiations.

On the other hand, we exhort the Palestinian people
and their leaders to continue to show restraint and not to
resort to violence. Violence serves only the interests of the
enemies of peace.

All parties concerned must realize that, ultimately,
there is no alternative to the peace process. Each party
must live up to its commitments. Each one is liable for its
actions.
