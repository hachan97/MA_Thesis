Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
should like to begin my statement by thanking the
Secretary-General for his presence and for his
statement.

China deems it regrettable that the draft
resolution on the extension of the United Nations
Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH) was
not adopted. China is in favour of the extension of
UNMIBH. We appreciate the contribution it has made
to stability and peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and
we therefore voted in favour of the draft resolution.

I listened attentively to the explanatory statement

made earlier by Ambassador Negroponte of the United
States. China understands the concerns of the American
delegation with respect to the International Criminal
Court (ICC). The Council also held several rounds of
consultations on this problem. Regrettably, however,
the parties concerned failed to reach an agreement. We
hope that the interested parties will continue their
consultations on the relevant issues, so as to ensure that
this problem will not stand in the way of United
Nations peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and
Herzegovina and other regions; that it will not
adversely affect the stability of the regions concerned;
and that it will not jeopardize the efforts made and the
achievements registered over the years by the United
Nations and by the international community at large.
