Mr. Ben Mustapha (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): I
wish at the outset to thank the delegations of France
and of the United Kingdom for having prepared the
draft resolution on which we have just noted. We also
thank you, Mr. President, for your own personal efforts
towards its unanimous adoption by the Security
Council.

Tunisia voted in favour of the draft resolution
even though some provisions do not command our
complete support. We wished, through this draft
resolution, to meet the needs of all international and
regional partners and international humanitarian
organizations, with a View to drawing attention to the
suffering of the Iraqi people and to trying to put an end
to that suffering, which has lasted far too long. That
suffering is a direct result of the sanctions that have
been imposed upon Iraq for the past 10 years.

That is why we had hoped that the draft
resolution would contain a clear and explicit request
for a focused assessment of the sanctions imposed on
the Iraqi people and of their effects. We believe that
such an assessment might have helped the Security
Council fully and completely to play its role in the
light of its own resolutions, and to ensure that those
resolutions were respected. That, however, did not
come about, which we regret.

Nonetheless, we are committed to the
continuation of the oil for food programme in order to
alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people; that is why
Tunisia did not wish to block the consensus that
emerged and that made it possible to adopt the draft
resolution.
