Mr. Eldon (United Kingdom): The Council has an
exceptionally busy agenda today and, in recognition of
that fact, I will shorten my statement, though the
Secretariat will distribute the full version. I should also
like to associate my delegation with the statement that the
Permanent Representative of Portugal will make later this
afternoon on behalf of the European Union.

We are grateful to Special Representative Petrov for
his briefing this afternoon. The road to peace in Tajikistan
has not been easy. The United Nations Mission of
Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) was forced to act in
volatile and dangerous circumstances, sadly losing six of
its staff, and the political process continues to be difficult,
with international observers declaring the recent
parliamentary elections to be deeply flawed.

We must take this opportunity to congratulate
UNMOT'S leadership and staff for their excellent work.
We should particularly remember those peacekeepers who
gave their lives to the cause of peace in Tajikistan. We
trust that the Government of Tajikistan will take steps to
ensure the safety of those personnel who are to remain in
the country.

 

We should not underestimate the task that faces the
people and leaders of Tajikistan if they are to grasp this
opportunity for lasting peace. The United Kingdom is
pleased that the Secretary-General intends to establish a
post-conflict peace-building office in Dushanbe. We hope
that the office will incorporate a significant human rights
capability. Respect for the human rights of the Tajik
people, the building of strong democratic institutions and
the enforcement of the rule of law are not optional extras.
They are key elements to the future peace and stability of
Tajikistan and their promotion should be at the core of the
new office's role.
