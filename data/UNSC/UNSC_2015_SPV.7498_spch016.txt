Mrs. Kawar (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): At the
outset, allow me to welcome the Ministers who have
come to this meeting from Malaysia, New Zealand,
Australia, the Netherlands and Ukraine. We certainly
appreciate all the efforts being made by those countries
in the independent investigation on the downing of
Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17.

One full year later, Jordan voted in favour of draft
resolution S/2015/562. We support the establishment of
an international tribunal to prosecute the perpetrators
of the downing of Flight MH-17. We believe that the
perpetrators must be held accountable. Their actions
led to the killing of 298 innocent persons. They must
be brought to justice under an independent judicial
mechanism that ensures effective, clear measures to
hold them accountable.
The importance of the draft resolution does not
just lie in holding accountable the perpetrators of such
acts, but also serves to deter any attempt to threaten
the safety and security of international civil aviation
in general. The targeting of civil aviation could stand
as a precedent unless it is uprooted and deterred. We
must prevent more such crimes and must not allow
the targeting of civilians. We must not fail to hold
perpetrators accountable.

Although the draft resolution before the Security
Council was not adopted today, efforts must continue
to reach a common understanding on the measures to
be taken and their implementation according to the
options presented by the Secretary-General. We stress
the importance of cooperation among all States in order
to achieve justice for the victims of that tragedy.
