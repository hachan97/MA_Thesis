Mr. De Loecker (Belgium) (spoke in French): I
have the honour to speak on behalf of the European
Union. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe
associated with the European Union 4 Bulgaria, the
Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland,
Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia - and the associated
countries Cyprus, Malta and Turkey, as well as the
member of the European Economic Space,
Liechtenstein, associate themselves with this statement.

The European Union would like to thank the
Under-Secretary-General, Mr. Guehenno, for having
officially confirmed the result of the election of 30
August. We have met today to welcome this moment,
which has often, and with reason, been described as
historic.

Ten days ago the East Timorese people took part
in democratic elections with great wisdom and serenity.
The European Union observer mission on the ground
reported that the elections to the Constituent Assembly
took place calmly and peacefully. We would like to
congratulate the East Timorese people and their leaders
for having successfully completed this first, but crucial,
step on the road to the establishment of democratic
political institutions in the future Timorese State. The
long independence process, which the European Union
fully supports, has today brought its reward.

We welcome particularly the significant
representation of women in the Constituent Assembly.
The European Union would also like to congratulate
the United Nations, whose Transitional Administration
has made possible the success of the electoral process,
for which they prepared with great professionalism.

The popular will freely expressed during these
elections must be followed by the representatives of the
Constituent Assembly during the three months granted
to them to discuss and draft the constitution of the
future State of East Timor. We wish them much success
in performing this important task.
