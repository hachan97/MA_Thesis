Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
has stated its principled position on the chemical
weapons attack in Syria. The draft resolution on the
establishment of a new investigative mechanism
submitted by the Russian Federation (S/2018/ 175)
condemns the chemicals weapons attack in Syria and
calls for the creation of a new investigative mechanism
to establish the facts and the truth. We can all agree on
those positive elements.

In addition, it proposes improved working methods
compared to previous investigative mechanism and
set out concrete steps to carry out a robust on-site
investigation on the ground and to ensure impartiality
in the process of collecting evidence. As a result, the
new investigative mechanism would be able to function
with greater professionalism and to reach a truly
credible conclusion. Those elements are in line with
China's principled position. We support Russia's draft
resolution. China regrets that the draft resolution was
not adopted.
