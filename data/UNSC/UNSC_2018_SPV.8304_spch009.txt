The President (spoke in Russian): I thank the
representative of Kazakhstan for the kind words
addressed to our presidency and, obviously, for wishing
our team success in the FIFA World Cup. Nonetheless,
let us make sure that every game in the World Cup is
crowned with success. May the strongest team win.
