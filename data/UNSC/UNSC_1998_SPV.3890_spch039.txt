Mr. Aass (Norway): Norway welcomes the adoption
by the Security Council of resolution 1172 (1998).

The decisions of India and Pakistan to carry out
underground nuclear tests are in clear defiance of
international norms and constitute a serious threat to the
global nuclear non-proliferation regime, as well as to
peace and stability in the entire region.

The tests underline the crucial importance of the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and
the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty for
international efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear
weapons and to achieve nuclear disarmament.
There is an urgent need to establish a channel for
constructive dialogue between the international
community and New Delhi and Islamabad, and to
convince India and Pakistan to renounce their nuclear
weapon programmes. It is vital to ensure that the situation
in South Asia does not deteriorate further to the point of
serious instability or war.

We urge India and Pakistan to immediately
announce a cessation to all further testing of nuclear
weapons and to renounce their nuclear programmes. This
is a matter of urgency and essential for generating the
confidence needed for security disputes to be resolved
through dialogue and negotiations.

India and Pakistan should commit themselves to
neither assembling nuclear devices nor deploying such
devices on delivery vehicles. India and Pakistan should
cease the development and deployment of ballistic
missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads.

We urge India and Pakistan to become Parties to the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and
the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty without
delay and without conditions. We also urge India and
Pakistan to enter into negotiations at the Conference on
Disarmament in Geneva on a treaty banning the
production of fissile material for nuclear weapons
purposes.
