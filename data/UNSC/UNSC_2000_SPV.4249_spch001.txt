The President (spoke in Russian): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Yugoslavia in which he requests
to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

On behalf of the Council, I welcome the Federal
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Yugoslavia, Mr. Goran
Svilanovic.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Svilanovic
(Yugoslavia) took a seat at the Council table.

The President (spoke in Russian): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Hedi Annabi, Assistant Secretary-
General for Peacekeeping Operations.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Annabi to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now resume its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, document
S/2000/ll96.
The Security Council will now hear a briefing by
Mr. Hedi Annabi, Assistant Secretary-General for
Peacekeeping Operations. I give him the floor.
