Mr. Hunter (United States of America): The United
States is pleased to join the consensus in support of the
mandate renewal today. I also want to commend France
for the cooperative spirit in which it led the process.

Maintaining peace and stability between Lebanon
and Israel is of paramount importance. The mandate
makes clear that the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) must have freedom ofmovement and
access to the Blue Line. The mandate also underscores
the importance of the arms embargo included in
resolution 1701 (2006). With the support of Iran,
Hizbullah has grown its arsenal in Lebanon in direct
threat to peace along the Blue Line and the stability
of all of Lebanon. In support of the Taif Accords, the
Security Council decided that all States shall prevent
the sale or supply of arms in Lebanon to any entity other
than the Government of Lebanon or UNIFIL. Twelve
years later, it is unacceptable that Hizbullah continues
to flout this embargo, Lebanon's sovereignty and the
will of the majority of the Lebanese people.

Another important component in this mandate
is the language on the Maritime Task Force. At the
inception of the Task Force, the Security Council failed
to provide a clear transition strategy and goal for the
Lebanese Navy to work towards eventually assuming
responsibilities for the Task Force. We have taken steps
to correct that oversight, and urge the international
community to support the strengthening and expansion
of Lebanese naval capabilities accordingly.

As we continue to review missions against our
peacekeeping principles, the United States will continue
to work to ensure that UNIFIL remains an effective
mission. We reiterate our commitment to supporting
the stability and peace that the people of Lebanon and
Israel have long desired.
