The President: I thank the President of the Republic
of Zimbabwe for his very important and constructive
statement and for his characteristically straight talk, which
I appreciate deeply. I also thank him for his kind words to
the American presidency.

I now give the floor to Mr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni,
President of the Republic of Uganda.
