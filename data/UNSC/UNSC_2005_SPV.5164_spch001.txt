The President (spoke in Chinese): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Ronaldo Mota
Sardenberg, head of the Security Council mission to
Haiti.

It is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

I should like to welcome the return of the
members of the Council and the Secretariat who took
part in the mission to Haiti.

I now call on Mr. Ronaldo Mota Sardenberg, head
of the Security Council mission to Haiti.
