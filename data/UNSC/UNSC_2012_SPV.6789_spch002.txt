Mr. Ladsous (Spoke in French): I should like
to thank you, Sir, for giving Council members this
opportunity to engage in an interactive dialogue with
all our Force Commanders. They have been meeting
throughout this week, as in previous years - indeed,
they have met 10 times this year - for the annual
conference of leaders of the military components of our
17 peacekeeping operations. Their week of discussion, I
believe, has been very useful. This is the third time they
have come to address the Security Council and engage
in this exchange.

I note that this year we have also invited Lieutenant
General Gutti, Commander of the African Union
Mission in Somalia. We have done so because we enjoy
very close cooperation with that African Union force.

I have nothing further to add. I believe that it
would be useful - with your agreement, Sir - for
them to introduce themselves one by one so that we
can all identify them. Four of them will be giving us
brief presentations on issues that I believe will be of
interest to the Council. Of course, when it comes to the
interactive dialogue, they will all be at the disposal of
the Council's members in order to answer any questions.
Of course, Lieutenant General Babacar Gaye, Chief
Military Adviser, needs no introduction and is known
to all.

I wish only to add that these are all exceptional
officers who are carrying out extremely sensitive
missions and enjoy my full confidence. I am proud to
work alongside them every day.
