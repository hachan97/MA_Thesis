The President (spoke in French): I thank
Mr. Egeland for his briefing.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, may I remind all speakers to
limit their statements to no more than five minutes, in
order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are

strongly urged to circulate the full text in writing and
to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.

I now give the floor to the Permanent Observer of
Palestine.
