Mr. Pankin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation found it possible to
support resolution 2146 (2014), which was prepared by
the United States, given the seriousness of the problem
faced by Libya's central Government and its appeal to
the Security Council. We agree that the illegal export of
Libyan oil threatens to further jeopardize the country's
stability, which already suffers from internal strife. At
the same time, we would like to highlight two points.

First, it is no secret to anyone that the situation that
the resolution aims at did not arise yesterday, or even
when the groups active in the eastern part of Libya
expressed ambitions. It predates that. I would like to
recall that the first delivery of oil from the eastern
part of the country made without central Government
authority took place in April 2011. Moreover, in May of
that year, an American company acquired oil in such an
unlawful manner. The State Department of the United
States, in a statement on 20 June 2011, supported those
unlawful actions. The genie was let out of the bottle,
and certain Libyan groups seemed to take a liking to
that. If it worked three years ago, why not try today?
Therefore, unfortunately not for the first time, we
are having to use emergency measures to deal with
problems that were created with the connivance and
even support of a number of Member States, including
some represented at this table.
Secondly, we assume that resolution 2146 (2014)
will not affect the regime established by the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, including
the general principle of the exclusive jurisdiction of a
flag State over its vessels on the open seas.
