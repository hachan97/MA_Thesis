The President: I thank Mr. Luis Ernesto Derbez
for his kind words on this initiative, which, in fact,
continues the excellent proposal that our Mexican
friends made. I would also like to stress the fact that
the principle of complementarity, underlined by Mr.
Derbez, is indeed a basic building block of this new
international architecture, where the global and the
regional are symbiotically interlinked.

I now call on His Excellency Mr. Said Djinnit,
Commissioner for Peace, Security and Political Affairs
of the African Union.
