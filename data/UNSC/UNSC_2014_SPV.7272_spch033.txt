The President: We recognize that Iraq is on the
front lines ofthe fight against extremism and terrorism,
and we are heartened by the numerous countries that
have pledged assistance and aid to Iraq in support of
this fight.

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Recep
Tayyip Erdogan, President of the Republic of Turkey.
Turkey, obviously, has been deeply affected by both the
flow of foreigh fighters and the displacement that has
resulted from the conflict in neighbouring States, and
so we thank the President for being here today.
