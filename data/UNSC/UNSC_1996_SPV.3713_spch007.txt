The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received letters from the representatives of
Argentina and Mali in which they request to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's
agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose,
with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Ms.
Ramirez (Argentina) and Mr. Sow (Mali) took the
seats reserved for them at the side of the Council
Chamber.

 

The President: Argentina and Mali have also joined
as sponsors of the draft resolution contained in document
S/1996/943.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements before the voting.
