Mr. Buallay (Bahrain) (interpretation from Arabic):
I should like at the outset to express our appreciation to the
Secretary-General for the comprehensive and detailed report
contained in document S/1998/148. I should also like to
thank the States participating in the Inter-African Mission
to Monitor the Implementation of the Bangui Agreements
(MISAB), as well as the Government of France, the
International Mediation Committee, the International
Monitoring Committee and United Nations programmes and
agencies for their significant efforts to achieve national
reconciliation and stability in the Central African Republic.

My delegation shares the concern of the Secretary-
General regarding the fragile political and security situation
in that country, particularly because light arms remain in
circulation and are obtainable from certain countries. This
situation is also due to the fact that some elements of the
former armed forces have fled to the south of the country,
and also to the presence of local militias to the north.
This makes it essential for the international community,
as represented by the United Nations, to be present in the
Central African Republic in order to restore stability and
security in the country.

Proceeding from the State of Bahrain's concern to
support security and stability in the Central African
Republic in particular, and in the region as a whole, as
well as our concern to see a United Nations presence in
that country, my delegation will support the draft
resolution before us, which pertains to the creation of a
United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic
(MINURCA). In this context, my delegation calls on all
parties to ensure the security, safety and freedom of
movement of the members of the Mission and the
protection of the Mission's property.
