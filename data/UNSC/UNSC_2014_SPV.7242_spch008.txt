Mr. Cherif (Chad) (spoke in French): I would
like to thank the United Kingdom for having taken
the initiative of presenting resolution 2170 (2014). We
welcome its unanimous adoption.

Chad voted in favour of the resolution and sponsored
it, because terrorism is a scourge that has neither a face
nor a border and is a threat not only to the region, but
to international peace and security. We continue to be
concerned by the flow of foreign fighters into Iraq and
Syria, as it is a clear threat to the region and a source of
concern for the rest of the world.

The resolution that we have just adopted sends a
strong message by the international community to
all terrorist groups around the world, including those
operating in other regions, such as in Africa. While
reiterating the need for a relentless campaign against
terrorism around the world, Chad reiterates its belief
that the barbarous and reprehensible acts perpetrated
by the Islamic State in the Levant, the Nusra Front and
groups associated with them cannot be attributed to one
religion, nationality or community, much less to one
civilization.

Chad welcomes the designation of Mr. Haidar
Al-Abadi as the future Prime Minister ofIraq. We hope
that the new Iraqi Government will be able to establish
the necessary conditions to maintain the cohesion,
unity, integrity and stability of the country while
respecting the diversity of Iraqi society.
