The President (spoke in Chinese): I believe that
the President for the month of June will take note of
the request made by the representative of the
Netherlands.

Let me take this opportunity to thank
representatives for the kind words they addressed to me
in the course of their statements.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 6p.m.
