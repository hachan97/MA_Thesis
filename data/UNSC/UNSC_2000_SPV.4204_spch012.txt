Mr. van Walsum (Netherlands): It is good to see
you in the chair again, Mr. President, for the first time
since August 1999.

Let me also pay tribute to Ambassador Ouane,
who so ably chaired our Council during the difficult
millennium month of September.

My delegation's contribution to this debate is
somewhat different from what I would have said if this
meeting had been held yesterday. Our sorrow at all the
tragic loss of life and large-scale human suffering, our
consternation at the excessive violence used by the
Israeli forces and our anger at Mr. Sharon's
irresponsible visit to the steps of the ancient shrines in
the Old City are not any less intense today. But today,
we are meeting on the eve of the Paris summit, at
which the parties will try to salvage the Middle East
peace process and resuscitate the efforts to reach a
lasting settlement.

In that light, it would seem more appropriate for
us to express our gratitude for the fact that, in spite of
everything that has happened, both sides seem to be
beginning to bring the situation under control, thus
setting the tone for tomorrow's meeting in Paris.

Against the background of the events of the past
six days, it is not easy to be optimistic, but it may just
be possible that these events have at last convinced
everyone of the urgency of a negotiated, lasting
settlement.
