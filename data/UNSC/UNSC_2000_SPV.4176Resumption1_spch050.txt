Mr. Otunnu: I wish to thank very much all of the
members of the Council as well as the broad
membership of the United Nations, especially those
that participated in this open debate. My colleagues
and I have taken very careful note of all the
observations and critiques that have been made. We
will do our best, together with the Council, to
incorporate them into the development of the mandate
of the Special Representative. I very much look
forward to continuing to work closely with the Council
and to the outcome of this debate and of the report
before the Council.

Allow me one other comment. I wish very
sincerely to congratulate my very good friend
Ambassador Kamalesh Sharma of India for a
characteristically rigorous and brilliant critique of the
mandate of the Special Representative and of the report
before the Security Council. He will be happy to hear
that I do not wish that the Massacre of the Innocents
had taken place around the time of his birth. On the
contrary, the United Nations would be so much poorer
without the systematic and serious perspectives that the
delegation of India brings to our discussions and
dialogue. I very much regret that due to the constraint
of time we cannot have a constructive dialogue on the
issues he raised, but I am sure that he and I and others
will find opportunities outside this Chamber to
continue this dialogue.
