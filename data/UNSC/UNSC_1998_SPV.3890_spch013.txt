Mr. Buallay (Bahrain) (interpretation from Arabic):
At the outset, I wish to express the gratitude and
appreciation of my country's delegations to the delegations
of Japan, Sweden, Slovenia and Costa Rica for their
commendable efforts to achieve a consensus formula on the
draft resolution before us today.

Bahrain, which is committed to international peace and
security, has on several occasions called on the international
community to strive for nuclear non-proliferation and the
complete banning of tests. We are convinced that these
destructive weapons, which could destroy all mankind, must
be banished from our world.

On this basis, Bahrain invites the two neighbouring
countries, Pakistan and India, with which we are friends, to
demonstrate the utmost possible restraint and to take the
steps necessary to reduce and eliminate the causes of
tension between them through dialogue. In this way, they
may find solutions to the problems that hamper relations of
good-neighbourliness between them.

My country welcomes the efforts of the Secretary-
General in this respect. We are convinced that dialogue
between the two countries is the best way to ease tensions
in South Asia.

Having raised the issue of peace and stability in
South Asia, we are prompted to raise that of peace and
stability in a neighbouring region of no less importance:
the Middle East. My country has constantly called for its
establishment as a nuclear-weapon-free zone and a zone
free of all weapons of mass destruction. We are
convinced that peace and security must be achieved in
that region and that nuclear war and its potential effects
on property and human beings must be avoided there.
