The President (spoke in French): We appreciate
France's support for the subject proposed by Romania,
as well as the individual contribution made in support
of projects aimed at developing regional and
subregional capacities for post-conflict stabilization
and reconstruction, in particular regarding the African
continent. I would like to assure the representative of
France that we intend to submit the results, which
could be useful in terms of achieving what he
mentioned earlier - a Security Council that is not only
realistic but also effective.

I invite the representative of the Chair of the
African Union, Mr. Aminu Bashir Wali, to take the
floor.
