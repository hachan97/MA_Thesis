Mr. Moura (Brazil): First, I wish to associate
myself and my delegation with the previous expressions
of appreciation to you, Mr. President, and your
delegation.

We support the draft resolution before us. We
believe this initiative will assure the continuation and the
expansion of the United Nations presence in Sierra Leone.
However, while taking fully into account the political
intricacies involved in achieving the Peace Agreement, I
wish to put on record that we do not associate ourselves
with the expressions of commendation directed to the
leadership of the Revolutionary United Front.

We commend the democratically elected
Government of President Kabbah, the Parliament and the
people of Sierra Leone for concluding the Peace
Agreement, as well as the countries of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for
fostering it. In this regard, we stress the role played by
Nigeria and Togo in particular.

We concur with the views expressed in paragraph 54
of the Secretary-Generals report (S/1999/836) before us.
We also encourage him to present in a timely way his
proposal for a new mandate and concept of operation for
an extended United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra
Leone (UNOMSIL).

We believe that if we do not want to fail our
collective responsibility to the people of Sierra Leone, we
will have to assure a robust and a multidisciplinary
medium-term presence of the United Nations. This will
help a great deal in assuring that the heinous acts against
the human rights of the people of Sierra Leone will not
be repeated and that true reconciliation will take place.
