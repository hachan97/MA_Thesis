Mr. Smirnov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Our delegation too is grateful to Ambassador
Sinclair for his thorough briefing. We thank the
representative of Papua New Guinea for further
clarifications on the peace process. We support the
efforts of the parties in implementing the Bougainville
Peace Agreement and we welcome the commitment of
the Papua New Guinea Government and the
Bougainville communities to a peaceful settlement.

We note with satisfaction the positive progress in
the peace process and the constitutional stage that it
has entered as a result of the successful completion of
stage II of weapons disposal. This was possible on the
basis of broad-based consultations and the confidence
that was placed in the United Nations Political Office
in Bougainville (UNPOB). We also highly commend
the work of UNPOB, headed by Mr. Sinclair, in
moving forward and achieving results in the peace
process. Much work remains to be done, and there are
concerns that not all parties concerned are involved in
the peace process. We believe that the political efforts
of UNPOB and the Papua New Guinea Government
must be continued, and we fully support these efforts.
We believe that the UNPOB mandate will be
successfully completed within the established time
frame.

We greatly welcome the regional efforts made,
including the activities of the Political Monitoring
Group, which completed its work on 30 June. We hope
that the Bougainville Transition Team, comprising
Australia, Fiji, New Zealand and Vanuatu, will
accomplish its mission and contribute to the successful
implementation of the peace process. We believe it is
important to continue and intensify cooperation
between the United Nations Development Programme
and other bodies of the United Nations in supporting
regional organizations and the post-conflict
reconstruction and peace-building processes in
Bougainville.
