Mr. Zhang Dianbin (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China listened closely to the briefing by the
representative of the United Kingdom.

China categorically opposes the use of chemical
weapons by any State, organization or individual,
regardless of the circumstances or purposes. China
supports the comprehensive, objective and fair
investigation of the alleged use of a chemical weapon,
which, based on solid evidence, should lead to
findings that are factual. That has been our clear and
consistent position.

We have followed developments following the
Salisbury incident in March. We believe that relevant
issues should be addressed in accordance with the rules
and procedures of the Chemical Weapons Convention
and within the framework of the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

We note the letter dated 5 September 2018 from
the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom
addressed to the President of the Security Council. We
also note that the parties concerned have not reached
conclusions acceptable to all parties on issues including
who should be held responsible for the incident. In that
regard, parties should work on the basis of mutual
respect and equal consultation and resolve the issue
through dialogue.

At a time when the international community
continues to face many challenges, parties should work
with, instead of against, each other, It is important to
maintain focus on the merits of the incident and avoid
politicization and moves that could fuel tensions.
Members of the Security Council should remain united
in a common effort to fulfil their duty to maintain
international peace and security.
