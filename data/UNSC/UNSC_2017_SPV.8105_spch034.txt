Mr. Aboulatta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I did not
intend to take the floor again, but I must express my
deepest regret about what has transpired in the Council
today and about how it has been transformed from an
organ responsible for maintaining international peace
and security into a media show.
I reiterate that we abstained in the voting on both
draft resolutions only after we made strenuous efforts
to bring differing positions closer together and to renew
and enhance the performance of the Organization for
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations
Joint Investigative Mechanism without compromising
its independence. We saw room for consensus and
tried to build on it. However, this opportunity was not
seized and the polarization continued until we reached
today's outcome.

I reaffirm that consensus is possible. There is
room for consensus if we have enough willpower.
We are prepared to pursue our efforts to preserve the
Mechanism and its independence.
