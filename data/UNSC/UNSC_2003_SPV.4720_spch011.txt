The President (spoke in French): I thank the
Regional Director of the Programme for Coordination
and Assistance for Security and Development
(PCASED) in Africa for his kind words addressed to
my country.

Following this important and interesting
statement by the Director of PCASED, I would like to
remind the Council that our meeting today is a
workshop and, as such, it is interactive. The groups of
speakers, if they wish, will be able to ask questions.
Since we have the opportunity of having with us this
morning the leadership of the African Union, the
Economic Community of West African States and
PCASED, they would certainly be glad to answer any
questions that might be raised.

The next speaker is Mr. Baboucarr-Blaise Ismaila
Jagne, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the
Gambia. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table
and to make his statement.
