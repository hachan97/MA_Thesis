The President (spoke in Russian): I thank the
Minister for Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
for his kind words addressed to my country.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/2000/1182) before it, as orally revised in its
provisional form. Unless I hear any objection, I shall
put the draft resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, China, France,
Jamaica, Malaysia, Mali, Namibia, Netherlands,
Russian Federation, Tunisia, Ukraine, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America.
