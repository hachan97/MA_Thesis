Mr. Mantovani (Italy): I wish first of all to
reconfirm our full confidence in the impartiality and
objectivity of the Secretariat and to express our thanks
to Under-Secretary-General Pascoe and Assistant
Secretary-General Mulet for their valuable briefings.

While we have clarified our position in all the
previous open meetings and consultations of the
Security Council, three or four times already, I would
like again to add our voice to support the unconditional
restoration of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Georgia, as a first step. I would like also to call for the
immediate cessation of hostilities and the restoration of
the situation prevailing prior to 6 August. I would thus
like to call for an immediate end to all ground, air and
sea operations in the area.

From that perspective, we wish to express support
for the joint mediation efforts of the European Union
and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe and for the specific ideas outlined by the
French presidency of the European Union. We believe
that the extension of the hostilities to Abkhazia is a
further source of deep concern and that all parties must
immediately comply with resolution 1808 (2008) in all
its aspects.

We welcome the opening of a humanitarian area
to protect civilians from the consequences of these
events and to ease suffering in this very difficult
situation.

Finally, we believe that the gravity of the
situation requires immediate action by the Security
Council.
