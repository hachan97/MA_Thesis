Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
orderly withdrawal of the United Nations Stabilization
Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) and the concurrent
step-up of a smaller successor peacekeeping mission,
on the basis of ensuring overall stability in Haiti,
is a consensus reached by all Council members and
is called for by the current situation. It meets the
expectations of all parties. Today's decision can help
the Haitian Government to assume its responsibility
for maintaining national security and stability. In the
light of those considerations, China voted in favour of
resolution 2350 (2017).

Meanwhile, we believe that the underlying tenet of
Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations is the
maintenance of international peace and security, which
does not involve human rights. We hope that Council
members will stay united in supporting MINUSTAH's
orderly withdrawal and continue to promote stability
and development in Haiti. MINUSTAH has played an
important role in maintaining security and stability
in Haiti since 2004. China highly commends this
development and progress.

As we speak, the situation in Haiti is largely
stable. New development opportunities have emerged.
We hope that all parties in Haiti will pull together to
preserve the current positive momentum and maintain
national stability and development. We hope that the
new Haitian Government will identify a development
path suited and tailored to national conditions without
delay, and that the international community, including
countries ofthe region, will continue to contribute to an
improved situation in Haiti.
