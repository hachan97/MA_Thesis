The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of
the members of the Security Council, I should like to
thank the Minister for External Relations of the
Republic of Angola, Mr. Joao Bernardo de Miranda. I
would kindly ask him to convey our appreciation to the
Government of Angola for its efforts to restore peace
and stability in that country.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Burkina Faso. I invite him to take a
seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
