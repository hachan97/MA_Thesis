Mr. Rugunda (Uganda): Uganda voted in favour
of resolution 1907 (2009). Uganda is interested in and
committed to playing a constructive role in the
prevention, mediation and resolution of conflicts in
Africa.

In its decision taken at the thirteenth summit held
in Sirte, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, from 1 to 3 July
2009, the African Union called upon the Security
Council to:

"impose sanctions against all those foreign
actors, both within and outside the region,
especially Eritrea, providing support to the armed
groups engaged in destabilization activities in
Somalia [and] undermining the peace and
reconciliation efforts and regional stability."

We commend the Security Council for positively
responding to the call by the African Union in the
search for peace and stability in Somalia and in the
region. We appreciate the overwhelming support of
Council members. The resolution is a clear
manifestation of the cooperation that exists between
the United Nations and the African Union in efforts
aimed at resolving conflicts and for the maintenance of
peace and security in Africa.

The measures imposed by this resolution are not
comprehensive but targeted and corrective. It is my
delegation's hope that Eritrea will take the necessary
09-66454
action to enable the Council to make a positive review
of the measures it has imposed today.
