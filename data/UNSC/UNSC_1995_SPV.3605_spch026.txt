Mr. Bakuramutsa (Rwanda) (interpretation from French): My delegation does not wish to engage in
polemics, since we have great respect for the French
delegationHowever, since we are called upon to furnish
some explanation here, I should like to state the position of
the Government of Rwanda in this respect.

 

First, with regard to Operation Turquoise, it is our
View that it came too late. It may very well have been
done with good will, but it was too late: a million
Rwandans had already been exterminated. In any event,
we do thank its participants for having come.

Secondly, as for its being a multinational force, I
should like to make a correction. The multinational part
of the force was symbolic. The force was made up of
people from one country only and its other members were
symbols to lend it an international flavour.

Thirdly, I should like to say that as for calling it a
humanitarian operation, that was not at all the case,
especially if one considers the materiel utilized by the
force upon its arrival. That materiel was far more military
than it was humanitarian.

Fourthly, I should like to point out that, whether
purposely or not - and again, I do not want to enter into
polemics - the zone created, known as Zone Turquoise,
was one in which all the criminals who had been unable
to cross the frontier came to take refuge. Their last
chance was the camp at Kibeho, where all their arms
were stockpiled - and everyone knows what happened
when they tried to get them out.
