Mr. Hunter (United States of America): I thank all the members of the Security Council for their support for this incredibly important mandate. As the world continues to grapple with the coronavirus disease, we express our thanks to all Council members for demonstrating their ongoing support for the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA). We would also like to extend particular thanks to Ethiopia for its contributions to UNISFA. The people of Abyei deserve to live in peace without fear of violence. They also deserve a functioning Administration that can offer security and the rule of law. We must not lose sight of those goals. In resolution 2550 (2020), the Security Council welcomes and encourages continued engagement between the Sudan and South Sudan to resolve the Abyei dispute. The commitments to addressing border issues and reviewing barriers to the full implementation of UNISFA's mandate, as agreed during the October meeting of the Joint Political and Security Mechanism, are very welcome developments. The parties should maintain that momentum moving forward. We look forward to the outcomes of the Secretary- General's joint consultation with the Sudan, South Sudan and Ethiopia on UNISFA's exit strategy, which the Security Council has requested in the resolution. Given the warming relations between the Sudan and South Sudan, a responsible exit strategy should be developed, and it must account for the continued security needs of the people of Abyei. We urge the African Union to play a key role in that consultation and to support the parties to achieve further political progress, especially as they take their own steps to resolve the Abyei dispute and address border issues. The United States remains committed to supporting peace and security in Abyei and in the Sudan and South Sudan.
