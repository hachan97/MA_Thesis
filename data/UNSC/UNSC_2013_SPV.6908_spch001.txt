The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them document
S/2013/48, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by France, the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of
America.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2013/7, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the United Nations Operation in
Cyprus.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.

I should like to inform the Council that the presidency
of the Council has met with the representatives of
the parties, who have confirmed that they maintain
their well-known positions vis-a-vis the item on the
Council's agenda. On the basis of those meetings,
with the consent of the members of the Council, the
presidency has drawn the conclusion that the Council
can proceed to take a decision on the draft resolution
before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by Show ofhands.

In favour:
Argentina, Australia, China, France, Guatemala,
Luxembourg, Morocco, Pakistan, Republic of
Korea, Russian Federation, Rwanda, Togo, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and United States of America

Abstaining:
Azerbaijan

The President: There were 14 votes in favour, none
against and one abstention. The draft resolution has
been adopted as resolution 2089 (2013).

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements after the voting.
