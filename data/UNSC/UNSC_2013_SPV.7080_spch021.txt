Ms. Bensouda: The Government of the Sudan's
representative speaks of the willingness and ability of
the Sudan to investigate and prosecute. The Security
Council is not the forum for addressing willingness
and ability. It is the responsibility of the judges of
the International Criminal Court (ICC) to assess
willingness and ability on a case-by-case basis.
The Government of the Sudan's representative has
stated plainly that he does not respect the decision
of the Council to mandate the Court and my Office
to investigate and prosecute the most serious crimes
committed in Darfur. The Government of the Sudan
has been aware of the alleged crimes committed by Ali
Kushayb, Ahmed Haroun, Abdelrahim Hussein and
Mr. Omer Al-Bashir. The nature of those crimes has
been made public for nearly nine years. Yet nothing on
those cases has been done. I invite the Government of
the Sudan to bring proof of that willingness and ability
to the judges of the ICC. I agree that the Court and the
Council have separate, although interrelated, mandates.
However, the Government of the Sudan's refusal to
challenge the admissibility of the cases before the ICC
or to arrest and surrender the individuals concerned is a
challenge - not only for my office but for the Council.
We cannot afford to ignore that challege any longer.
