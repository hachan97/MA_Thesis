The President (spoke in French): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of France.

France voted in favour of the draft resolution
submitted by Algeria because we believe that the
Security Council should send a strong and clear
message to the parties in the present context of
extremely heightened tensions in the region.
The text was considerably amended and improved
during the negotiations over the last 48 hours. The text
ultimately reproduces the balance of the declaration of
the Ministers of the European Union and condemns the
killing of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin as an extrajudicial
execution which is a practice that France has always
opposed as contravening international law. The text
also condemns all terrorist acts against civilians.
France has systematically condemned terrorist acts,
those heinous acts which have killed hundreds of
Israelis since September 2000.

Finally, we appeal to the parties to respect
international law and fulfil their obligations within the
framework of the road map. The road map is the only
possible path. Violence is not an option and must
cease.

I regret that it has not been possible to achieve
consensus. France finds it particularly regrettable that
the Council, once again, finds itself paralysed
regarding this pivotal issue for stability and for
international peace.

I now resume my function as President of the
Council.

The Permanent Observer of Palestine has asked
for the floor. I now give him the floor.
