Mr. Hume (United States of America): One stark
set of facts hangs over the otherwise credible performance
of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia
(UNOMIG) and the peace-keeping force of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). We have
witnessed the almost total absence of progress towards a
political settlement of this conflict or towards the
expeditious return of the tens of thousands of refugees
and displaced persons to their homes in Abkhazia in
safety and in dignity.

The Council has asked the Secretary-General to
report twice in the short period of four months on the
status of the political process and on the return of
refugees and displaced persons. When the Council comes
to consider the future of UNOMIG in May, we, and I
trust other Council members will look closely and

 

seriously at the entire situation to determine whether
continuation of this Mission is justified.

The United States delegation hopes that the Secretary-
General's reports will give the Council reason to act
favourably in this regard, but we must be realistic. Recent
history does not paint an optimistic picture. The Abkhaz
party bears a strong burden of responsibility for the absence
of progress. By declaring themselves a sovereign nation,
Abkhaz leaders have violated their commitment to reaching
a mutually acceptable settlement with the Government of
Georgia. The Council has rightly expressed its deep concern
about this act and indicated that that declaration has no
standing.

By establishing UN OMIG, the Security Council
showed that it was prepared to help those who are helping
themselves. Since then the process has reached a stalemate.
The message of this renewal resolution is clear: now is the
time for the parties to return to the table and to achieve real
progress toward a political settlement and the return of
refugees and displaced persons in secure and safe
conditions.
