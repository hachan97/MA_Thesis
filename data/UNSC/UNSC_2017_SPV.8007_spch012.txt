The President (China) (spoke in Chinese): I shall
now make a statement in my national capacity.

China welcomes the unanimous adoption by the
Council of resolution 2368 (2017). Terrorism is the
common enemy of humankind. China supports the
international community in coordinating its activities
and in adopting to an integrated and effective approach
to enhance cooperation against terrorism, especially
the use of the Internet by terrorists to spread, incite and
organize terrorist activities, terrorist financing and the
return of terrorist fighters.

In the realm of counter-terrorism, we must
adhere to uniform standards, fully leverage the
leading role of the United Nations and the Security
Council and enhance international coordination
effectively. The Committee established pursuant to
resolutions 1267 (1999), 1989 (2011) and 2253 (2015)
concerning ISIL (Da'esh), Al-Qaida,and associated
individuals, groups, undertakings and entities is an
important counter-terrorism mechanism of the United
Nations and the Security Council. China supports the
Committee in enhancing communications with the
countries concerned and in strengthening cooperation
with regional and subregional counter-terrorism
mechanisms, in accordance with the mandate given
to it by the Council. The Committee must constantly
improve its work effectiveness so that it can make
a greater contribution to advancing the counter-
terrorism cause.

We also hope that Member States and the Secretariat
will strictly comply with the relevant resolution and the
Committee's rules ofprocedure, and continue to support
and cooperate with the Committee in its work so that,
together, we can defend the authority and effectiveness
of the sanctions regime.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

There are no more names inscribed on the list
of speakers.
