Mr. Abarry (Niger) (spoke in French): Through you, Mr. President, I would like to thank the Secretary- General for his introductory remarks and Ms. DiCarlo for her briefing, which, unfortunately, describe the serious situation currently in the Syrian Arab Republic. The conflict has changed not only in nature but also in intensity, as the Secretary-General rightly said. On behalf of the Niger, we call on Russia and Turkey to continue the dialogue. We trust in their ability to find a compromise so as to stop the current escalation, for, otherwise, even the slight hard-won gains in humanitarian terms will be jeopardized. While the Syrian Government has the right to fight terrorists, whose presence on its territory no one doubts, that must be done in compliance with international humanitarian law. We deplore the loss of lives in recent days and extend our deepest condolences to the grieving families. Yesterday, in this very Chamber, the Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and the Executive Director of UNICEF, supported by United States Ambassador Craft, spoke from a mother's heart about the tragedy in Syria, the victims of which are women and children (S/PV.8734). We must listento their poignant call to put an end to this tragedy unfolding in Syria before our very eyes. It is time to do something; it is time to act. In that regard, we support the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General and of certain countries to stop the dangerous deterioration that has been taking place in Syria in recent days.
