The President (spoke in Chinese): I would like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Lebanon, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In accordance with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration without the right to vote in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Salam
(Lebanon) took a seat at the Council table.

The President (spoke in Chinese): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Terje Roed-Larsen,
Special Envoy for the Implementation of Security
Council Resolution 1559 (2004).

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Roed-Larsen to take a seat at the
Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document 5/2008/654, which contains the eighth
semi-annual report of the Secretary-General to the
Security Council on the implementation of Security
Council resolution 1559 (2004).

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Terje Roed-Larsen, Special Envoy for
the Implementation of Security Council Resolution
1559 (2004). I now give the floor to Mr. Roed-Larsen.
