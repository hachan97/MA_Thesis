The President: There are no other speakers on my
list.

I believe that we have had a very useful debate on
this subject. We very much appreciate the briefing and
update given by Mr. Annabi on the report of the
Secretary-General. A few points emerged quite
prominently from the debate.

Council members welcome the report of the Bosnia
Joint Presidency concerning the implementation of the
New York Declaration of 16 November 1999 and urge all
parties to redouble their efforts to implement the
outstanding commitments that remain to be fulfilled.

The members also urge those concerned to ensure
without further delay the integration of the Ministry of
Interior as well as the integration of the chain of
command and communication systems of the police
throughout the Federation and in particular in Mostar. The
Council members look forward to a report from the
United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina
(UNMIBH) on compliance with these requirements as
soon as possible.

Council members also urge all parties, in particular
the Republika Srpska authorities, to increase the number
of minority police officers, in accordance with their
obligations.

These are the points which I believe came out
prominently in the discussion today.

Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 2.10 p.m.
