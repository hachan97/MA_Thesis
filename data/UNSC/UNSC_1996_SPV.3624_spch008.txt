Mr. Martinez Blanco (Honduras) (interpretation from Spanish): My delegation wishes at the outset to
welcome the Member of the Collective Presidency of the
Liberian National Transitional Government and to thank
him for participating in the work of the Security Council
today.

As it did at the Security Council's meeting to
consider the fifteenth report of the Secretary-General on
the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia
(UNOMIL), my delegation wishes to express its concern
at the recent incidents in Liberia - cease-fire violations
and attacks against personnel of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) - and at delays in the
process of disengagement and disarmament of Liberian
forces, which affect the international community's efforts
to restore peace, security and stability in that country.

We regret also that those incidents are also having
an effect on the fulfilment of the commitments undertaken
in the Abuja Agreement, the implementation of which is
critical for the future of Liberia. We believe that the
leaders of the Liberian factions should demonstrate the
political will to support the peace process; they cannot
expect ECOWAS and the international community to
support the Liberian peace process indefinitely.

The recent armed attack against ECOMOG
contingents in the town of Tubmanburg was a serious
setback for the peace process and will delay the
deployment of ECOMOG and UNOMIL forces, for which
there are now no guarantees of safety. My delegation
believes that the security situation in Liberia will improve
only if the factions respect the cease-fire; make clear
progress in the disengagement of forces; withdraw from
checkpoints; permit the community of humanitarian-aid
donors to carry out its work freely; cooperate with
ECOMOG and UNOMIL in the work of disarmament and
demobilization; and strictly respect the status of
ECOMOG and UNOMIL personnel.

We hope that the Liberian factions will fulfil all
those commitments. It is in that hope that my delegation
will vote in favour of the draft resolution before the
Council.
