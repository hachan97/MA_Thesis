Mr. Beyle (Somalia): I should like briefly to
thank the members of the Security Council and the
international community very much for the great
assistance that they have given my country. I should
like to report that Somalia is much better today than
it was even a few days ago, and that it is getting
better every day. That is because of the assistance of
the international community, especially the Security
Council and the United Nations. We wish to thank the
international community very much.

I would also like to convey to the Council the
greetings of Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, President
of the Federal Republic of Somalia. We are a country
in a serious war against terrorists who do not observe
the embargo. As the Council is very well aware, just a
few weeks ago, our President was almost assassinated.
The attackers came all the way down to Villa Somalia.
That shows how strong that group is and how weak our
forces are.

I take note of the adoption of resolution 2142 (2014).
The reality is that we have to redouble our efforts
to closely and diligently work with the Monitoring
Group and the Council to do better next time. I hereby
convey to the Council our serious commitment to doing
so - we are very serious about that. Next time I come
here, I hope that we will have done everything possible
on our side to see the sanctions/embargo lifted.

I would like to conclude by thanking the Council
once again. We very much appreciate what has been
done and what is being done for my country.
