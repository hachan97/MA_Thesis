Ms. Loj (Denmark): I, too, would like to
welcome the statement by the Chairman-in-Office of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE), the Foreign Minister of Belgium. As a
member State of the OSCE, we welcome and endorse
the priorities for the Belgian chairmanship in 2006. I
particularly welcome the Minister's stress on the
continued close cooperation with the United Nations in
implementing priorities and, in particular, cooperation
in the fight against terrorism.

I have the honour of chairing the Security
Council's Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). In that
capacity, I welcome the intention of the Chairman-in-
Office to ensure continued and deepened cooperation
between the OSCE and the CTC in the fight against
terrorism. The cooperation between the OSCE and the
CTC is, indeed, a model for the cooperation that the
Committee is striving to establish with regional
organizations in other areas of the world.

In conclusion, I welcome the enhanced focus of
the Belgian chairmanship of the OSCE on the
economic dimension. As the Minister and Chairman-
in-Office knows, the United Nations has recently
decided to establish a Peacebuilding Commission. I am
confident that, in getting the work of the Peacebuilding
Commission under way, the United Nations could be
inspired by the work already undertaken by the OSCE
in ensuring stabilization, democratization and
development as the bases for sustainable peace. I
therefore look forward to intensified cooperation
between the OSCE and the United Nations.
