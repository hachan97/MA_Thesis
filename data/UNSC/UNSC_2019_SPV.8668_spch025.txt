Mr. Repkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): As I understand it, these questions are
addressed personally to Mr. Dmitry Polyanskiy, who is
at an event with the Secretary-General at the moment.
He will undoubtedly respond to them. I do not want
to turn the important subject of national reconciliation
into what is frankly an effort to dig up the past. In any
event, we will respond to him bilaterally.
