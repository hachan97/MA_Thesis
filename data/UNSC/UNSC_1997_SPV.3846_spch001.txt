Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Cyprus, documents 8/1997/962 and addendum 1, and the

which contains the text of a draft resolution prepared in
the course of the Council's prior consultations.

It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before
it. If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft resolution to
the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:

Bissau, Japan, Kenya, Poland, Portugal, Republic of
Korea, Russian Federation, Sweden, United

were 15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 1146 (1997).

stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.
