The President: I wish to inform all concerned
that we will be carrying on today's open debate right
through the lunch hour, as we have a large number of
speakers. I would also remind all speakers to limit their
statements to no more than four minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to circulate their texts in writing and deliver
a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.

I now give the floor to the representative of the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
