The President: I thank the representative of the
Republic of Korea for his kind words addressed to my
delegation.

I now give the floor to Mr. J ean-Marie Guehenno,
who has patiently sat through our extensive debate, and
request him to offer his comments on the various issues
raised in this discussion.
