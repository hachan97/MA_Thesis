The President: I thank the representative of
Costa Rica for his kind words addressed to me.

There are no further speakers on my list. On
behalf of the entire Security Council, I thank those who
have been closely involved with this agenda item -
the Ambassador of Mexico, Ms. Coomaraswamy, and
the staff and leadership of UNICEF - for their
important work on this dossier.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
