The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank the
representative of Morocco for the kind words he
addressed to me.

There are a number of speakers remaining on my
list. Given the lateness of the hour, and with the
consent of the Council, I intend to suspend the
meeting. The Security Council will continue its
consideration of the item on its agenda following the
adjournment of the private meeting between the
members of the Security Council and the countries
contributing troops to the United Nations Mission in
Bosnia and Herzegovina, scheduled for 3.30 p.m. today
in Conference Room 4.

The meeting was suspended at 1.25 p.m.
