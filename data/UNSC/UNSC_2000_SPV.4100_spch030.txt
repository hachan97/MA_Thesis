Mr. van Walsum (Netherlands): My delegation, like
those of France and the United Kingdom, endorses the
statement that will be made by the representative of
Portugal on behalf of the European Union.

The protection of United Nations, associated and
humanitarian personnel is a subject of high priority for the
delegation of the Netherlands, and we are grateful to the
Argentine presidency for having convened this open
meeting on the subject. We owe it to your delegation's
initiative, Sir, that this morning we had the benefit of
hearing the Executive Director of the World Food
Programme, Ms. Bertini, describe the enormous risks to
which humanitarian workers are exposed. My delegation
was touched by the warm words she devoted to Ms. Saskia
van Meijenfeldt, who was shot, execution-style, in Burundi.

We agree with all speakers who have pointed out that
atrocities of this nature will continue to occur as long as
they can be committed with impunity. Accordingly, we
reiterate our call that all such incidents must be properly
investigated not only so that those responsible may be
brought to justice, but also so that, within the United
Nations system, maximum benefit may be drawn from
lessons learned. We were struck by Ms. Bertini's
description of the dilemma which arises when risks
approach a threshold at which they become unacceptable,
while, on the other hand, calling off the operation would
mean that innocent civilians would die. We are acutely
aware of this dilemma and of the phenomenon that, as a
result of protracted exposure to danger, this threshold tends
to creep upwards. In speaking of lessons learned, we
particularly call on those concerned to focus on this
problem. It is our impression that the threshold problem
was a factor in Saskia van Meijenfeldt's death.

I would again like to refer to the statement to be
made by the representative of Portugal.
