The President (spoke in Chinese): Under rule 39
of the Council's rules of procedure, I invite Mr. Abou
Moussa, Special Representative of the Secretary-
General and Head of the United Nations Regional
Office for Central Africa, to participate in this meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2013/67l, which contains the report of
the Secretary-General on the activities of the United
Nations Regional Office for Central Africa and on
areas affected by the Lord's Resistance Army.

I now give the floor to Mr. Moussa.
