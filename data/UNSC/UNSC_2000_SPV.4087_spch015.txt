The President: I would like to thank Mr. Wolfensohn
once again for joining us for the first time in the history of
the Security Council and the World Bank. I hope that the
Security Council will invite him to join us again. On behalf
of the entire Security Council, we thank him for his
important statement today and for his contribution to the
important effort that we are discussing.
