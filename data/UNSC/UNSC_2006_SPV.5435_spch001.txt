Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior

the report of the Monitoring Group on Somalia.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2006/287, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft

There being no objection, it is so decided.

unanimously as resolution 1676 (2006).
