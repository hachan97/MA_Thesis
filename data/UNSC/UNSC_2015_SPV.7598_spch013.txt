The President: I take this opportunity to wish
Ambassador Dabbashi, his delegation and the Libyan
people peace over the next weeks as we head into the
New Year.

Again, I underscore what we said yesterday, when
we thought we were speaking for the last time, about
how invaluable the contributions our colleagues who
are leaving the Council have been. However, they are
not going far, and we know they will be a critical part of
maintaining peace and security and advancing United
Nations values more broadly. We have been so lucky to
work together.
The meeting rose at 3.50 pm.
