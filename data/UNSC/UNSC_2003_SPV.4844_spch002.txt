The Secretary-General: May I commend the
members of the Security Council for having reached
this significant agreement on what, obviously, is a
particularly important resolution to address the
complex situation in Iraq. The process has been
difficult. But the outcome is a clear demonstration of
the will of all the members of the Security Council to
place the interests of the Iraqi people above all other
considerations.

Our common objective is to restore peace and
stability to a sovereign, democratic and independent
Iraq as quickly as possible. It is critical to the Iraqi
people, the region and the entire international
community that we succeed in reaching the goal of an
Iraq that is at peace with itself and with its neighbours,
and is contributing to stability in the region.

As Secretary-General, I shall do my utmost to
implement the mandate established by the Security
Council, bearing in mind the constraints on building up
the required capacity and my obligation to care for the
safety and security of United Nations staff. I am
grateful to the Council for the flexibility that the new
resolution gives me in this respect.

Although at this moment the United Nations has
only a skeletal presence on the ground, we are
determined to continue helping the Iraqi people as best
we can, from both inside and outside the country,
primarily in providing humanitarian assistance.

As circumstances permit, I plan to proceed with
the other tasks indicated in the resolution. I have no
doubt that we all look forward to the earliest possible
establishment of an elected Government that will return
Iraq to full sovereignty.
