The President: The Security Council will now
proceed to the consideration of its annual report to the
General Assembly, for the period from 1 August 2010
to 31 July 2011.

Members of the Council have before them the
draft report. The introduction to the draft report was
prepared by the delegation of Germany, as President of
the Council in July 2011, with the participation of the
other members of the Council. The body of the report
was prepared by the Secretariat. I should like to
express appreciation to Germany and the Secretariat
for their respective contributions.

I should like to point out that the draft report was
prepared in accordance with the note by the President
of 26 July 2010 (S/2010/507).

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Peter
Wittig, Permanent Representative of Germany, in his
capacity as head of the delegation responsible for
drafting the introduction to this year's annual report.
