The President (spoke in Arabic): Since I have no
other speakers on my list, the Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.

However, allow me at the end of this important
meeting to express once again to His Excellency
President Kabila the thanks of the members of the
Security Council for his initiative of coming to meet
with us and exchange views on the situation. The
members of the Council have listened with great
attention to President Kabila's important statement - a
very clear message concerning his view of the future of
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and ways and
means of re-establishing peace and security in the
Great Lakes region. The Security Council will be
following this matter with a great deal of attention
during the course ofthe month.

The meeting rose at 5.25 pm.
