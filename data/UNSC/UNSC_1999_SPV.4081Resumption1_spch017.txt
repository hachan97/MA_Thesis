Mr. Sharma (India): My delegation welcomes this
interactive session on the United Nations partnership with
Africa, and I am very happy to see you, Sir, presiding
over it.

In September our Minister of State spoke in the
Council when it last discussed Africa. We do not know to
what use the Council put the views and ideas expressed
at that meeting, but we hope that it will take seriously
into account the views of States that are not its members.
As merely symbolic gestures, such discussions will serve
little purpose.

Respecting the time limit indicated by you, Sir, I
wish to touch upon only some aspects of the questions
you have posed.

Regarding how to improve cooperation between the
Council and the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
we feel that African countries are better placed to speak.
However, as a general principle, whenever a conflict
breaks out, or before it, when tensions rise, peace or calm
can be restored only if the parties themselves are willing
to resolve their differences. The first and paramount need,
therefore, is for the countries most affected to show the
political will to settle their problems peacefully.

The record in Africa is impressive. On almost every
major conflict, Africans themselves have found, or are
trying to reach, diplomatic solutions, as in Liberia,
Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of
Congo, Burundi and Ethiopia-Eritrea. Once a framework
has been drawn up for a peaceful settlement, international
support often becomes essential, and the role of the
Security Council then becomes crucial. The Council has
several roles to play: in putting its political weight behind
an agreement, in mounting peacekeeping operations and
in monitoring implementation. Here, regrettably,
experience has shown that Africa's efforts have often
been stymied or undermined by the lack of support from
the Council. The solution for this lies in the Council
alone. In the name of supporting African initiatives, the
Council should not abdicate its responsibilities under the
Charter.
On the question of meeting more effectively the
African needs for peacekeeping, we welcome international
efforts to strengthen Africa's capacity for peacekeeping
and are happy to note that the Secretariat has been paying

 

greater attention to this requirement, as detailed by the
Secretary-General in his reports, including A/54/63 issued
in February 1999. The Secretary-General notes that
peacekeeping remains a vital United Nations instrument,
and he has suggested additional steps through which
incremental progress may be made to enhance African
peacekeeping capacities. We are encouraged that some of
his recommendations are being acted upon.

As the Secretary-General has said in one of his
reports, despite the successes of the international
community's action in Mozambique and elsewhere, the
experience of Somalia still seems to haunt some members
of the Council. However, the arguments of the high cost of
operations or lack of resources or risk to peacekeepers are
not tenable. A tardy and insufficient response by the United
Nations only serves to send wrong signals to the parties and
strengthens the View that Africa is being neglected.

A large number of speakers before us have spoken
about the need for expeditious action in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo. The South African Ambassador said
earlier today that the Democratic Republic of the Congo
was the litmus test. We support the call for speedy action
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The United Nations Trust Fund for Improving
Preparedness for Conflict Prevention and Peacekeeping in
Africa, which has been used to support training activities in
some countries in Africa, has received contributions from
only one country. I am happy to say that this is your
country, Mr. President. No further comment is needed.

On the question of additional instruments, we do not
think that we need to look for new instruments to resolve
conflicts in Africa. Existing instruments - if applied
sincerely, impartially and in a transparent manner - are
adequate. The problem has been that instruments at hand
have not been used at all or have not been used well. An
example of this is the fact that even though an arms
embargo has been imposed against UNITA in Angola, it
has no paucity of arms or other resources acquired through
connivance or complicity. The Council must, therefore, pay
greater attention to prompt and full implementation of its
own decisions.

We have welcomed and actively participated in the
Council's debates on Africa. However, the solutions to
Africa's complex problems require a multidisciplinary
approach with a strong economic- and social-development
component. Such an approach is outside the mandate of the
Council, and the nodal bodies for it are the General
Assembly, the United Nations specialized agencies and
the international financial institutions. While the Council
must be more active on Africa, it should abjure the
temptation to encroach on areas beyond its mandate.

In conclusion, let me say that India is proud of its
long-standing links with Africa and its participation in
almost every United Nations peacekeeping operation in
the continent, starting with the complex and difficult
operations in the Congo. Currently Indian troops and
civilian police personnel are participating in three out of
the four United Nations peacekeeping missions in Africa.
Even as we discuss efforts to enhance the United Nations
partnership with Africa, around 1,700 Indian peacekeepers
are on their way to Sierra Leone to join the United
Nations mission there. The international conference on
United Nations peacekeeping, which we hosted in New
Delhi in March this year, placed major emphasis on
peacekeeping in Africa, with case studies undertaken on
United Nations operations in Somalia, Rwanda and
Angola. We made special efforts to ensure wide
participation from Africa.

This, perhaps, is an area that the Council needs to
look into. African States have developed expertise in
peacemaking and peacekeeping which we need to draw
upon. The Council and the Secretariat will find that it will
repay them to listen closely to, and build upon, African
experience.
