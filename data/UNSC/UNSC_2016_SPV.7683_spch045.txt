Mr. Prystaiko (Ukraine): Ipromise, Mr. President,
that this will be my last statement. The Russian
representative was recalling yet another detail of our
long and bloody conflict. The so-called agreements of
21 February- which he just cited-were made possible
with help of the four parties. But the representative of
the Russian Federation has chosen not to remember the
fourth party - Russia was at the table. Although three
members of the international negotiating team helped
Ukraine, the opposition and the President to sign the
agreement, the Russian representative was the only
party who did not sign the document. Obviously, he was
not happy with the agreement between the opposition
and then President, Mr. Yanukovych.

In that regard, I have to remind the Council that
the official medal that was produced by the Russian
Federation for the so-called return of Crimea has the
dates on it, starting with 20 February, which is the
day before that agreement was brought to the attention
of the Security Council by the representative of the
Russian Federation. Therefore, the Russian Federation
started - not just planned, but started - the annexation
of Crimea the day before we reached the first agreement
and while President Yanukovych was still in power.
