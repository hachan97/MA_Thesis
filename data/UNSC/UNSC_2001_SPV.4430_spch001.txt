The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Belgium and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia in which they request to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Sahovic'
(Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) took a seat at
the Council table; Mr. De Loecker (Belgium) took
the seat reserved for him at the side of the
Council Chamber

The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Hedi Annabi, Assistant Secretary-
General for Peacekeeping Operations.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Annabi to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now resume its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

The Security Council will now hear a briefing by
Mr. Hedi Annabi, Assistant Secretary-General for
Peacekeeping Operations.

I give the floor to Mr. Annabi.
