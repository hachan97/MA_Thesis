Mr. Cabactulan (Philippines): I thank you,
Mr. President, for calling this emergency meeting.

It is with great sadness that the Philippines
received confirmation that Malaysia Airlines Flight 17
had crashed in eastern Ukraine yesterday, 17 July. The
downing of MH-l7 is a most shocking and confounding
event. Aboard that flight were 298 irreplaceable lives.
Today we are united in grief. The Philippines conveys
its most heartfelt condolences to the families and to
the Governments and the peoples who lost their lives
in the incident. Today we are united in denouncing
this regrettable incident. The Philippines condemns in
the strongest possible terms the downing of Malaysia
Airlines Flight 17.

This incident is revolting, in particular in view of
troubling and disconcerting reports that the crash was
occasioned by a targeted move. The Philippines joins
the call to immediately secure the area of the crash site,
to launch an independent, transparent and international
investigation into the incident and to provide full and
safe access to investigators to the scene of the crash
to enable them to swiftly conclude and report on the
results of the investigation.
