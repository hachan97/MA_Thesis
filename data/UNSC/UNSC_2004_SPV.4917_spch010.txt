Mr. Thomson (United Kingdom): We welcome
this opportunity to discuss the deeply troubling
situation in Haiti with the representative of Haiti and
with important regional actors, and with the
participation of the Secretary-General. We recognize
and understand the regional concerns about the
situation.

The United Kingdom fully supports the statement
that will be made by the Irish presidency on behalf of
the European Union shortly, so I will confine myself to
just one or two points.

The United Kingdom believes a resolution to the
current political crisis can still be obtained by peaceful
means through negotiation. In this context, we fully
support the plan of action put forward by the Caribbean
Community and the Organization of American States.
It is an important basis for a solution to the crisis.

We urgently call on all parties in Haiti to exercise
restraint, to contribute to the restoration of law and
order, to make the well-being of the civilian population
their priority, to observe human rights scrupulously and
to respect the international humanitarian personnel and
facilities in Haiti. We urge the Government and
opposition to re-enter negotiations in the interests of
the Haitian people.

The United Kingdom continues to support the
efforts of those working to find a peaceful solution to
the crisis. We acknowledge the call for international
involvement in Haiti, and we are ready to consider
carefully and quickly proposals for the international
community to contribute to the stabilization of the
situation and to its durable, long-term improvement.
