Mr. Inchauste Jordan (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): We have taken note of the
information we received today about the events that
took place on 4 March. Bolivia would once again like to
express its firm and absolute condemnation of the use
of chemicals as weapons, which is an unjustifiable and
criminal act, regardless of where, when or by whom it is
committed. This is a serious violation of international
law and international peace and security, and we hope
that it will be investigated by the appropriate bodies
methodically, technically, thoroughly, conclusively and
without politicization.
