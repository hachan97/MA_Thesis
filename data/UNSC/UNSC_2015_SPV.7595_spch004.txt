Mr. Delattre (France) (spoke in French): I thank
the three authors of the important resolution 2258
(2015): Jordan, New Zealand and Spain. The resolution
represents a genuine step forward, as it seeks to facilitate
access for humanitarian agencies across borders and
front lines within Syria so as to deliver humanitarian
assistance to the Syrian population. The United Nations
Verification and Inspection Mission, provided for
under resolution 2165 (2014), allows United Nations
humanitarian convoys to cross borders and front lines
so as to continue to delivery assistance to millions of
Syrians in need. There are growing numbers of Syrian
isolated in hard-to-reach areas. The mechanism is
therefore more critical than ever, and it was crucial to
extend and strengthen it.
Having said that, I recalled in our consultations
yesterday that humanitarian access is not enough.
Ongoing violations of international humanitarian
law, in particular indiscriminate attacks on
civilians - including with barrel bombs - and the
use of hunger as a weapon of war against civilians, are
unacceptable and should be condemned as forcefully as
possible. The Council should remain more active than
ever on this topic.
