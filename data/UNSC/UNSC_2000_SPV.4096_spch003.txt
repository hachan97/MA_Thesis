The President: I am very touched by the Deputy
Secretary-General's remarks; she captured the essence of
what the presidency tried to do this month. I would only
stress that the extraordinary unanimous support of all the
other 14 members of the Security Council was critical to
this, in its every aspect. And I underline the point that the
test is in one word: follow-up.

Let me bring to the Council's attention that we are
graced again this morning by the presence of President
Clinton's Special Envoy for the Great Lakes area,
Ambassador Howard Wolpe, who is well known to most
members as the most senior person in the United States
Government who has spent his career in Africa.

I am also very pleased to acknowledge that we have
been joined by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of
Namibia and President of the General Assembly - and,
as it also turns out, a part-time North Carolina
constituent - His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab. We
welcome him and look forward to hearing his statement.

I call next on His Excellency Mr. Frederick J .T.
Chiluba, President of the Republic of Zambia. I thank him
for remaining in New York over the weekend to give us
a farewell charge on behalf of himself and of his great
country, and in his extraordinarily important capacity as
the leader of the Lusaka process. I welcome him to the
Security Council for the second time in a week.
