The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Sierra Leone, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I understand - and this is a bit unusual - that
the representative of Sierra Leone has been delayed
because of problems caused by the transit strike. I
would be grateful if the secretariat could take him to
his seat at the Council table when he arrives.

In accordance with the understanding reached in
the Council's prior consultations, I shall take it that the
Security Council agrees to extend an invitation under
rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure to
Mr. Daudi Mwakawago, Special Representative of the
Secretary-General for Sierra Leone.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Mwakawago to take a seat at the
Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2005/777, which contains the twenty-
seventh report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Mission in Sierra Leone.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing from the Special Representative. I now give
the floor to Mr. Mwakawago, Special Representative of
the Secretary-General for Sierra Leone.
