The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Iraq, in which he requests that the
Committee of Financial Experts of Iraq be invited to
participate in the consideration of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite Mr. Abdul Basit Turky Saed, head of that
Committee, to participate in the consideration of the
item, without the right to vote, in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Abdul Basit
Turky Saed (Iraq) took a seat at the Council
table.

The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Jun Yamazaki,
Controller of the United Nations.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Yamazaki to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of Council
members to document S/2010/563, containing the third
report of the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 3
2
of resolution 1905 (2009), and document S/2010/567,
containing a note verbale dated 28 October 2010 from
the Permanent Mission of Iraq to the United Nations
addressed to the President of the Security Council and
its enclosures.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear
briefings by Mr. Jun Yamazaki and Mr. Abdul Basit
Turky Saed.

I now give the floor to Mr. Yamazaki.
