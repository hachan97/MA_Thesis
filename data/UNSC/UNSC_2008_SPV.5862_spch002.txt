Mr. Annabi: I am very pleased to be back in the
Security Council today and to have the opportunity to
update members of the Council on the work of the
United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti
(MINUSTAH) in accordance with the mandate
entrusted to it under resolution 1780 (2007), which was
adopted last October.

In Haiti today we face a time of opportunity,
which is also a time of risk. As reflected in the report
(S/2008/202) before the Council, we are encouraged by
the political, security and institution-building progress
to date and by initial signs of improvement in the
socio-economic situation. Those gains are real and
significant, but we must also recognize that they are
only a first step, that that progress remains
extraordinarily fragile and subject to swift reversal and
that we have far to go before it can be considered to be
durable and sustainable. As an introduction to this
morning's discussion, it may be useful to share with
the Council our thinking on the way forward.

The foundation of any durable progress in Haiti
will remain the existence of a minimal level of political
consensus in the country. To date, the current
Government, which came to office in June 2006
through an electoral process that was strongly
supported by MINUSTAH, has sought to promote such
a consensus, and it generally continues to enjoy
legitimacy in the eyes of the public. It has relied on
that legitimacy to begin to address a number of key
issues, including the strengthening of State institutions
and the fight against corruption and impunity.
President Rene Preval and Prime Minister Jacques
Edouard Alexis have taken a very clear stand in that
regard.

While this political consensus remains vital, it is
also extremely fragile. There are clear and continuing
08-29739
threats that democratic debate could relapse into
political infighting and instability and that that could in
turn generate violence. Over the past six months,
tensions between individual political actors and among
the various branches of the Government have at times
threatened to escalate and to undermine public
confidence. The potential for a deterioration in
relations was made clear by the interpellation - the
summoning - of the Prime Minister before the
Chamber of Deputies in late February. While the
majority of deputies voted in support of the Prime
Minister, that process was a clear reminder of the
degree to which collaboration remains fragile.

Still more recently, we saw a dramatic indication
of the potential for problems, when a shooting took
place in parliament during a debate related to
investigations into alleged spending irregularities by
legislators. Further problems may lie ahead, related,
inter alia, to continuing inquiries over the possession of
double nationality by legislators and Government
officials, over the question of constitutional reform and
over the preparation of elections for one third of the
Senate. Furthermore, the current unrest that we are
seeing in various parts of the country, which is
frequently presented as demonstrations against la vie
chere - the high cost of living - also appear to have
a political dimension, in addition to expressing
mounting frustrations about the rising cost of basic
food commodities.

MINUSTAH will continue to do what it can to
promote constructive dialogue, but it is also incumbent
upon the wider international community to actively
encourage a responsible approach by all political
actors. Ultimately, political progress will depend upon
the Haitians themselves. While moments of tension
will be inevitable, it is crucial that political leaders and
opinion makers rise to the occasion and show restraint
and a genuine desire for collaboration and dialogue.

Overall, the country's democratic structures must
be strengthened and nurtured, in order to favour a
greater institutionalization of dialogue and to help
break a tradition of politically motivated violence. It is
also essential that the country's basic administrative
capacities be enhanced, so that essential services can
be provided to the population. MINUSTAH can
provide a small portion of the assistance that is
required, and it will continue to support the local
authorities. It will also continue to work towards the
strengthening of national capabilities in such key areas
as border management. But coordinated bilateral aid
will remain vital to enable real and durable progress.
08-29739

In the area of security there have also been
important gains over the reporting period, alongside
warning signs that the situation remains fragile and that
further efforts are required. The sustained security
operations conducted by MINUSTAH in the first part
of last year against gangs in Port-au-Prince and
Gonaives in support of the Haitian authorities continue
to bear fruit today. The overall security situation in the
country remains far better than it was, but we have also
seen a resurgence of kidnapping in the past few
months. An average of about 30 kidnappings has been
registered per month during the period from December
2007 to the end of March 2008.

Those numbers are becoming a political liability
for both the Government and MINUSTAH. There are
also recurrent indications that gangs may be trying to
reorganize themselves. Those kinds of threats, which
appear essentially criminal in nature, may be - and
often are - manipulated for political purposes.

At the same time, we have seen a rise in anti-
Government demonstrations, with a particular focus on
the recent dramatic increase in the cost of living, as I
mentioned earlier. The potential security implications
of such unrest were made clear last week, when such
demonstrations required the evacuation of our offices
in Les Cayes, in the south of the country. Similar
demonstrations, albeit less violent, also took place last
week in Gonaives, Port-au-Prince and a few other
locations.

Because of the Violence that has occurred in the
past, the Haitian public is particularly sensitive to
threats of instability. A firm and visible response is
essential and can only be achieved through
collaboration between the Haitian authorities and
MINUSTAH, whose military and police are playing a
critical role.

In order to combat the threat of criminality and
violence, we have reinforced our collaboration with the
Haitian authorities and enhanced sharing of
information. We have stepped up the presence of
checkpoints throughout Port-au-Prince, where most of
the kidnappings have taken place, and we are working
to enhance the investigative and response capabilities
of our police, an area where we will need the continued
help of police-contributing countries to obtain the
necessary skills that MINUSTAH currently lacks. At
the same time, our formed police units are working
closely with their Haitian counterparts to respond to
incidents of civil unrest.

The Mission is also reinforcing its presence along
the land and maritime borders of Haiti, as mandated
under resolution 1780 (2007). Our objective is to
support the extension of State authority in the area and
to help the Government to deter smuggling or illicit
trafficking in drugs and arms that could have
implications for the security of the country. As
reflected in the report, we are now deployed at the four
main crossing points along the land border and are
undertaking regular land patrols on the coastline and
joint maritime patrols aboard Haitian coast guard
vessels, pending deployment of our own maritime
capabilities. However, real effectiveness in this area
will necessarily depend on complementary bilateral
assistance to the Haitian authorities from Member
States in the region and beyond.

Alongside their role in responding to threats, our
military and police have also provided assistance in
times of urgent humanitarian crises. Their
resourcefulness and dedication have made a crucial
difference in that regard.

We have also launched a series of innovative
community violence reduction projects that we believe
can make a genuine difference on the ground. By
providing immediate employment through small-scale
projects, those efforts can breathe some desperately
needed hope into troubled areas and help diminish the
economic pressures that fuel constant cycles of
violence. They support the reintegration of some of
those who have been involved in lesser criminal
activities by including them in the workforce. They
also help generate some tangible improvements in the
daily lives of communities at risk. I personally visited
six of those projects last month in Cite Soleil and
Martissant and was encouraged to see that, after some
delays, that community violence reduction programme
is now on track.

The consolidation of security will require, of
course, the creation of viable Haitian rule-of-law
structures that can progressively assume more
responsibilities as their capacity increases. Over the
past six months, some progress has taken place, but
much more remains to be done to reach the
benchmarks noted in the report.

MINUSTAH has been working closely with the
Haitian authorities to implement the Haitian National
Police reform plan. Some 8,450 officers are now in
service, approximately 1,000 of whom are undertaking
functions other than policing, such as those of
corrections personnel, the coast guard and the fire
brigade. While that represents a substantial step
forward, it is far short of the minimum of 14,000
officers who are required to ensure basic policing
functions, according to the Haitian National Police reform
plan. MINUSTAH will continue its efforts to assist in the
professionalization of the police and its institutional
development, but complementary bilateral support will
obviously remain indispensable to meeting the
outstanding needs of the police, including in key areas
such as infrastructure, transport, telecommunications
and other equipment.

Similarly, the adoption last December of three
critical laws on the independence of the judiciary and
of national reform plans for the justice and penal
systems, drawing on strong support from MINUSTAH,
can pave the way for progress. But continued,
coordinated efforts will be essential to turning those
blueprints into reality. Sustained engagement by the
Haitian political leadership will be necessary to put in
place the Superior Council of the Judiciary and the
School for Magistrates, which are of key importance.
Priority must also be given to short- and medium-term
steps to address the situation in the prison system,
which is unacceptable from both a security and human
rights perspective. Here again, bilateral assistance is
indispensable to providing the additional resources,
skills and equipment that are required for even basic
effectiveness.

Finally, the socio-economic situation also
presents a mixed picture. While such problems do not
fall directly within the mandated responsibilities of
MINUSTAH, it is clear that stability and development
are inextricably linked.

Haiti has made significant progress in stabilizing
the economy, and real gross domestic product (GDP)
growth is estimated to have risen to 3.2 per cent in 2007,
which brings Haiti, in terms of overall level of the GDP,
back to the level of 1991. The annual inflation rate
declined to about 8 per cent last year, down from 30 to 40
per cent a few years earlier, and the currency has
remained stable. The Government has prepared a national
growth and poverty reduction strategy paper which
embodies Haiti's development priorities and should form
the basis for future assistance strategies, starting with the
discussions that are expected to take place on 24 and
25 April 2008 in Port-au-Prince.

All of that is encouraging, but it has not yet
brought about any immediate improvement in the
difficult living conditions of the vast majority of the
population, who have in fact experienced additional
hardship as a result of the significant increases in prices
of a number of staple commodities over recent months.
That has generated growing public discontent over what
is called in Haiti "la vie chere", which has a clear
potential to undermine all of our stabilization efforts.

In that context, it is urgent that donor countries,
the international financial institutions and the private
sector, including Haitians living abroad, work with the
Haitian authorities to find creative ways to generate
what I call a stability dividend - in other words, an
immediate and tangible improvement in socio-
economic conditions that can allow the stabilization
process to advance.

I would like to conclude by reiterating that we still
have far to go in Haiti. As noted in the report, the Haitian
authorities have primary responsibility for the
stabilization process. However, it is equally obvious -
and the Haitian authorities themselves are very clear on
this point - that they cannot do it alone. They will
continue to need substantial external assistance. Similarly,
the continued presence of a peacekeeping operation is
indispensable, and it must be supplemented by the
sustained and coordinated efforts of bilateral donors and
the wider international community.

Our common objective must be one of crossing a
definitive threshold of stability that would obviate the
need for a future peacekeeping operation in Haiti. In
line with the Security Council request made in
paragraph 22 of resolution 1780 (2007), the present
report provides some initial proposals on benchmarks
by which consolidation of the stabilization process
might be measured in each of the key areas of our
mandate. We have identified five such benchmarks.

First, the area of political progress could include
the completion of the new electoral cycle, which begins
this year with the senatorial elections and should
culminate in a peaceful transition to a democratically
elected president and parliament in 2011.

Secondly, a sustainable security structure should
be created, one capable of responding to threats while
respecting professional standards.

Thirdly, key elements of an independent and
credible judicial and penal system that upholds human
rights standards should be established.

Fourthly and more generally, the establishment
throughout the country of a functioning administration
that can deliver basic services, including an effective
border management strategy, is essential.

Finally, palpable improvements in the living
conditions of the general population and positive
growth in gross domestic product for a number of
years, as well as a significant rise in employment and
in the level of investments, are key indicators that, we
believe, the Security Council should keep in mind as it
takes decisions regarding the future of its involvement
in Haiti.

In a rapidly changing and often difficult
environment, it is important to avoid the trap of
premature optimism or, alternatively, disproportionate
discouragement in the face of inevitable setbacks. I
believe that we must stay the course and stay focused
on the reality that this is probably an exceptional
moment of opportunity for Haiti to escape the
destructive cycles of the past. We need to work
together to ensure that this opportunity is seized, that
the country's emerging stability is consolidated and
that firm foundations are laid for a better future.

Let me thank you, Mr. President, and the other
members of the Council for your strong support for
Haiti. Your support will remain key to MINUSTAH's
success as we continue our work on the challenging
road ahead of us.
