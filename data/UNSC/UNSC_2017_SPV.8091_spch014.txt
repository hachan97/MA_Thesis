Mr. Cheng Lie (China) (spoke in Chinese): I thank
Ms. Bensouda for her briefing. China has been closely
following the situation in Libya and its development.
It also supports all efforts conducive to stabilizing the
situation in the country and promoting the political
process. The international community should respect
Libya's sovereignty, independence and territorial
integrity, remain committed to advancing a Libyan-
led and Libyan-owned political process through the
good offices of the United Nations, and support the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General for
Libya, Mr. Ghassan Salame, in his efforts to promote
the United Nations action plan for the resumption of
an inclusive Libyan-owned political process under the
facilitation and leadership of the United Nations.

We hope that all parties in Libya will be able to
settle their differences through inclusive political
dialogue, on the basis ofthe Libyan Political Agreement,
arrive at a solution that can accommodate the concerns
of all parties, promote national reconciliation,
restore State governance and strive to achieve peace,
stability and development as soon as possible. That
is a major prerequisite and basis for justice in Libya.
The international community should join forces to
provide concrete and effective assistance to the Libyan
peace process.

China's position on the International Criminal
Court remains unchanged.
