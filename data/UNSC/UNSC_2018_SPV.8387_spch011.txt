Mr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish):
We wish to express our satisfaction at the adoption of
resolution 2440 (2018), renewing the mandate of the
United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara. We voted in favour of the resolution, as we
consider it necessary to support the political process
aimed at resolving the issue of Western Sahara and to
meet the humanitarian needs of the Sahrawi people. In
that regard, we consider it urgent to resume the political
process, under the auspices of the United Nations and the
Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Western
Sahara, Mr. Horst Kohler, without preconditions and in
good faith. We reiterate our full support in that regard.

We hope that a just, lasting and mutually acceptable
political solution can be achieved between the parties on
the basis of international law and the relevant resolutions
of the Council, leading to the self-determination of
the people of Western Sahara. In that regard, we look
forward to the holding of the round table in Geneva on
5 and 6 December, and encourage the participants to
take advantage of that important opportunity to move
towards a solution to this long-standing question.
