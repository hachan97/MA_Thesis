The President: There are no further speakers for
this meeting. I should like once again to thank Sir
Jeremy Greenstock for his briefing today. This has
been a most useful meeting.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 6.35 pm.
