Mr. Kafando (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French): I
will be brief. First of all, I wish to thank my neighbour
at the Council table and my friend, Johan Verbeke, for
having presented the 90-day report of the Security
Council Committee established pursuant to resolution
1737 (2006), which he has delivered in the clearest
possible manner. In its capacity as a Vice-Chairman of
that important Committee, my delegation of course
assures him of our fullest cooperation.

We have noted certain points from his statement
upon which we would like to comment. We should like
to comment on the preparation of national reports,
clarification requests by Member States and the
Committee's taking into account of resolution 1803
(2008).

With regard to national reporting on
implementation of resolutions 1737 (2006) and 1747
3

(2007), we note that work remains to be done. We
believe that the Committee should consider creating
frameworks for writing such reports to assist Member
States. Such frameworks could, for example, take the
form of questionnaires. That would facilitate diligent
reporting by Member States, in accordance with
paragraph 19 of resolution 1737 (2006) and paragraph
8 of resolution 1747 (2007), and would make it easier
for the Committee to use the reports.

Concerning requests for clarification about
certain aspects of the sanctions regime against the
Islamic Republic of Iran, the 1737 Committee should,
to the extent possible and within the framework of its
mandate, have a proactive information strategy
regarding the experience it has gained. That would
mean providing States with the answers to questions
repeatedly asked in clarification requests. In our view,
such a strategy would make it possible to raise States'
awareness about effective sanctions implementation.

As regards resolution 1803 (2008), adopted by
the Security Council on 3 March 2008, we believe it is
important that the Committee take into account the
additional competences entrusted to it by that new
resolution. We welcome the changes that the
Committee plans to make to its guidelines to adapt
them to the resolution.
