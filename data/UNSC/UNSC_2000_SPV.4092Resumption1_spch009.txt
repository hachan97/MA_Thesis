The President: I would like to mention now that I
will forego our space in the speakers order and not
deliver a national statement today in the interests of time
and to allow more people to speak. I would also like to
note the return to the Chamber of President Mugabe of
Zimbabwe - we welcome you back - and the
Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity,
His Excellency Salim Salim. We are delighted that you
were able to return.

I now call on the Minister of the Armed Forces of
Mali, Mohamed Salia Sokona.
