Mr. Gombo (Chad) (spoke in French): I too would
like to thank the Chair of the Committee established
pursuant to resolution 1737 (2006), Ambassador Gary
Quinlan of Australia, for his very detailed quarterly
report on the activities of the Committee for the period
of 20 March to 24 June of 2014.

Chad takes note of the report of the Panel of
Experts (S/2014/394, annex), created under resolution
1929 (2010) and which supports the work of the 1737
Committee, and the recommendations contained in the
report. We encourage the members of the Committee to
continue their discussions on those recommendations.
We also take note ofthe efforts aimed at a rapprochement
between Iran and the International Atomic Energy
Agency. We welcome the bilateral discussions between
Iran and certain countries, as well as the holding of two
rounds ofhigh-level negotiations on nuclear issues, from
14 to 16 May and from 16 to 20 June in Vienna, in the
framework of the joint plan of action adopted in Geneva
on 24 November 2013 between Iran and its partners and
the P5+1 aimed at reaching a final agreement on the
Tehran nuclear programme before 20 July 2014.

Nevertheless, there have been constant violations
on the part of Iran, which Chad deplores. Iran and its
partners are at a crucial phase in their negotiations and
we hope that they will reach a negotiated settlement on
their differences for the good of international peace and
security.

In conclusion, we need to recognize that sanctions
need to evolve to reflect the situation on the ground.
That is why we think that there should be an alleviation
of sanctions to bring the Iranians to the negotiating
table.
