The President: I thank the representative of Nigeria
for his kind words addressed to me.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution (S/1996/162)
before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:

Botswana, Chile, China, Egypt, France, Germany,
Guinea-Bissau, Honduras, Indonesia, Italy, Poland,
Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America

The President: There were 15 votes in favour. The

draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as resolution
1049 (1996).

The representative of Burundi has asked to speak once
again, and I now call on him.
