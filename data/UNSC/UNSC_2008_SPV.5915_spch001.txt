The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

At this meeting, the Council will hear briefings
by the four ambassadors who led the Security Council
mission to Africa: His Excellency Mr. Dumisani

and His Excellency Sir John Sawers, Permanent
Representative of the United Kingdom, who together
led the mission to Djibouti in connection with the
situation in Somalia, and to the Sudan; His Excellency
Mr. Jean-Maurice Ripert, Permanent Representative of
France, who led the mission to Chad and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo; and His Excellency
Mr. Michel Kafando, Permanent Representative of

I would like to welcome the return of the
members of the Council and of the Secretariat who
took part in the mission to Africa.

joint leaders of the mission on Somalia.
