Mr. Prins: The Secretariat is encouraged by
today's rich and constructive debate and by the
Council's commitment to take further action in the
field of small arms. The urgency of the issue was
highlighted once again with the just-released news
message from the World Food Programme (WFP)
stating that in Darfur, in 2008 alone, 60 WFP trucks
have been hijacked, with 39 trucks still missing - and,
most horrifyingly, with 26 drivers unaccounted for.
Small arms always play a central role as enablers of
such violence.

For the Secretary-General's recommendations to
be followed up, it will be important that all continue to
pay close attention to the issue. It is up to Member
States whether, for instance, they want to establish an
ad hoc working group to examine those
recommendations, as was suggested this morning, or to
agree on a presidential statement, or to take other
action. The debate shows clearly the importance of
consistently including the small arms situation in
almost any other debate the Council holds.

For its part, the Secretariat will work actively on
integrated and coordinated measures stemming the
excessive accumulation and universal availability of
small arms.
