Mr. Dah (Cote d'Ivoire) (spoke in French): My
delegation thanks the United Kingdom for having
initiated this briefing on the letter (8/2018/218) of
13 March from Mrs. Theresa May, Prime Minister of
the United Kingdom, following the events that took
place in Salisbury on 4 March. We also thank Ms. Izumi
Nakamitsu, High Representative for Disarmament
Affairs, for her briefing.

Cote d'Ivoire takes note of the findings of the
report of the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons (OPCW) confirming the identity
of the nerve agent used in Salisbury on 4 March,
which led to the poisoning and hospitalization of three
people. It welcomes the British authorities' request to
the OPCW to share the report with all States parties
to the Chemical Weapons Convention and to make its
summary public.

My country is paying particular attention to the
follow-up to the investigation conducted by the British
authorities with a view to conclusively shedding light
on that incident. We call on the various stakeholders
to exercise restraint and to cooperate with the
investigation, in accordance with their international
obligations. My country reaffirms its principled
position condemning any use of chemical weapons,
regardless of the perpetrators, in times of both peace
and war.

In conclusion, Cote d'Ivoire welcomes the collective
efforts under way to establish an accountability
mechanism with regard to the use of chemical
weapons. The international community's commitment
to combating impunity remains fundamental to
ensuring respect for the non-proliferation regime
and for our shared commitment to achieving a world
free of chemical weapons and all other weapons of
mass destruction.
