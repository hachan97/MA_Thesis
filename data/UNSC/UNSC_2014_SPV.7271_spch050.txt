The President: I appreciate that and look forward
to continuing to work with Qatar in the days ahead.
This week will be important as we develop some of our
efforts.

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Yousef
Bin Al-Alawi Bin Abdulla, Minister for Foreign
Affairs of Oman, to whom and through whom I offer
my profound thanks to His Highness the Sultan and
to himself with respect to a number of initiatives, but
most recently their generous support for the Palestinian
economic initiative.
