Mr. Vilovic' (Croatia): As other delegations have
done, I would like to thank the Chairman-in-Office of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE), Foreign Minister Stubb, for his
briefing today, and also for all the skill and effort he
has put into chairing that organization. We note the
complementarity of the OSCE mandate with that of the
United Nations and the partnership that has been
developed. We also note with pleasure the
revitalization of the organization under the Finnish
chairmanship.

Three regional crises have been mentioned today,
and we commend the OSCE for its engagement in
Georgia, Kosovo and Afghanistan. We particularly note
the efforts dedicated to and the results achieved in the
OSCE engagement in Georgia.

The Chairman-in-Office was rather modest in
enumerating the achievements thus far. We know that
there are results that the OSCE has achieved in the
context of the Forum for Security Cooperation and the
Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights,
particularly in Kosovo, with respect to minority rights -
and not only in the monitoring of elections but also, as
was mentioned by the Italian delegation, in the field of
the fight against terrorism.

We were particularly glad to hear the approach to
the "frozen conflicts" today. We think it is a good way
to solve the problems that exist and not sweep them
under the carpet.

Finally, I would like to extend our best wishes for
the upcoming ministerial meeting in December in
Helsinki and pledge the full and continued cooperation
of my country with the efforts of the OSCE.
