The President: I thank the Special Envoy for his
statement and for his repeated affirmation of
willingness to cooperate with the Panel in the future.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. I want to thank the Ministers, the Panel
Chairperson, and the Panel members for their work and
their contribution to this phase of our discussion. I
think the discussion, as the Special Envoy just said, has
been illuminating in many respects. There are
differences in perspective, of course, but there seems to
be some grounds for hope that progress can be made in
addressing and resolving the concerns that were raised
and explored today.

I would express my own hope that in the future
discussions in this Chamber on this subject and others
we could avoid excessive rhetoric that does not
contribute to the purposes of this Council.

The Council's own view of this phase of our
discussions on the Democratic Republic of the Congo
will be set out in a statement that I will make on behalf
of the Council in the near future, that is, in the next
five minutes.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Council will remain seized of the matter.

This meeting is adjourned, to be followed by the
next session of the Council in five minutes.

The meeting rose at 5.50 pm.
