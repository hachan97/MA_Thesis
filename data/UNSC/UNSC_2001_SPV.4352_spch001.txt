The President (spoke in Chinese): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2001/511, containing a letter dated 21 May
2001 from the Secretary-General addressed to the
President of the Security Council, transmitting the
report of the Committee of Experts appointed pursuant
to Security Council 1333 (2000) regarding the
monitoring of the arms embargo against the Taliban
and the closure of the terrorist training camps in the
Taliban-held areas of Afghanistan. Members of the
Security Council also have before them document
S/200l/74l, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by Colombia.

I should like to point to an error in the draft
resolution. In operative paragraph 5, the word "Teams"
should read "Team". The text will be amended
following the adoption of the draft resolution.

It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/2001/74l) before it. IfI hear no objection, I shall
now put the draft resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by Show ofhands.

In favour:
Bangladesh, China, Colombia, France, Ireland,
Jamaica, Mali, Mauritius, Norway, Russian
Federation, Singapore, Tunisia, Ukraine, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America.

The President (Spoke in Chinese): There were
15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 1363 (2001).

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 6.20pm.
