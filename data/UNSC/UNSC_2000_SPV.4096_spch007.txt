The President: I thank the Foreign Minister of
Namibia for his extremely important statement and for his
kind words addressed to Ambassador Wolpe, to me and to
the American presidency. I would simply like to make one
comment: as President of the General Assembly, he will
officially be receiving a letter from some of the members
of the Security Council proposing that the General
Assembly, too, consider the question of AIDS. That letter
will reach him later in the day; I want everyone here to
know that it is on its way. The lead has been taken by three
members of the Security Council, who will probably
mention the matter later.

It is now my great privilege to call on the Foreign
Minister of South Africa, Ms. Dlamini-Zuma. I again
welcome her to the Security Council; we await her
statement with great interest.
