Mr. Gasana (Rwanda) (spoke in French): A
moment ago, the Permanent Representative of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo made an attempt to
confuse the members of the Council. Fortunately,
absurdity never killed anybody. The representative of
the Democratic Republic of the Congo sought to sully
and to tarnish Rwanda's image by saying that Rwanda
had sent 20,000 prisoners to the Democratic Republic
of the Congo. I would like to say to the Council that
that was a lie, pure and simple. I would ask everyone
present here not to take the representative of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo seriously. The
Security Council should not be a forum for insults.
