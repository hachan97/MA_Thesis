The President: I shall now make a statement in
my capacity as the representative of Portugal.

I wish once again to express Portugal's deep
appreciation to Ambassador ngu and her team for the
very skilful and efficient way she conducted the
Council's business during the month of October. I
wish, of course, to thank my colleagues for their kind
words of support in connection with our tenure in the
presidency.

I thank the Prosecutor of the International
Criminal Court, Mr. Moreno-Ocampo, for his report
and comprehensive briefing today. I also want to
commend him for the investigative work under way,
for the efforts that his Office is undertaking and for the
information provided on the recent mission to Libya
and its contacts with the National Transitional Council.

We welcome Libya's announcement to submit to
an Independent Commission of Inquiry into the
circumstances surrounding the death of Muammar
Al-Qadhafi. We are concerned by reports concerning
violent acts of retaliation, persecution and revenge in
recent days in different parts of the country. We
strongly believe that accountability for all violations of
human rights must be ensured. In that context, we must
stress the need to protect migrants, in particular from
the sub-Saharan region, from violence and persecution.

We express our full support to the Office of the
Prosecutor for the continuation of the investigation
efforts, and we commend the support by States and
organizations in those endeavours to assist the
Prosecution.

Finally, we look forward to the report to be
presented early next year by the United Nations
International Commission of Inquiry established by the
Human Rights Council. We expect that the Office of
the Prosecutor will continue to closely liaise with the
Commission.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Libya.
