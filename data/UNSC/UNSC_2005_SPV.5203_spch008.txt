Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
wish at the outset to thank the Minister of Justice of
Burundi for his statement. I should like also to thank
Assistant Secretary-General Zacklin for his briefing.

We are very pleased to see that in recent months
the political process in Burundi has been making
consistent positive progress. That is a result of the joint
efforts of the Government of Burundi and the entire
international community. China considers that the
establishment of an international judicial commission
of inquiry for Burundi would be consistent with the
wishes of the Burundian people and would help the
further development of the political process in that
country.

China supports the recommendations set out in
the report transmitted by the Secretary-General
(S/2005/ 158): the establishment of a national truth and
reconciliation commission and the establishment of a
special chamber within the court system of Burundi to
bring to justice those responsible for committing
crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war
crimes. China supports the Security Council
authorizing the Secretary-General to hold talks with the
Government of Burundi and the other parties in the
country with a view to implementing those
recommendations.
