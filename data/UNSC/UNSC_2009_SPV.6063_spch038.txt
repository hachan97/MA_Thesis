Ms. Shalev (Israel): In 2005, when Israel left
Gaza, we hoped that we would never have to return.
But eight years of continuous rocket attacks by the
Hamas terrorist organization, Hamas' refusal to extend
the period of calm and its smuggling of weapons
during that period left Israel with no choice but to act
in self-defence.

Responsibility for the current hostilities lies
squarely with Hamas. The international community
must focus its attention on the cessation of Hamas'
terrorist activity and make it clear that a terrorist
organization can never be a legitimate leadership.

The past eight years of terror and the period of
so-called calm have taught us that any arrangement
must be fully respected and secured, including the total
cessation of rocket fire and smuggling, in order to be
durable and to allow the possibility of lasting peace.
