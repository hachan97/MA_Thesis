Mr. Auvaart (Estonia): We welcome the adoption of resolution 2507 (2020). We would like to thank the penholder, France. It is regrettable that we are not unanimous regarding this resolution, whose sole purpose is to curtail the hostile actions of armed groups that seek to undermine peace and security in the Central African Republic. We should not be divided on the issue of restricting the illegal flow of weapons to a country that is suffering from warfare and violence, but should instead unite in finding ways to assist the Central African Republic in stopping massacres such as the one in Bria just this week. We extend our condolences to the delegation of the Central African Republic. We should join together in helping the Central African Republic to counter the spread of measles, which was declared a national epidemic three days ago, and assist the country in its disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and security sector reform processes. Turning to positive developments, we welcome the commitment of the Government of the Central African Republic and the progress made on the five benchmarks agreed by the Council. We believe that it is our common goal to restrict the flow of weapons into hands that would use them to further destabilize the vulnerable situation in the Central African Republic.
