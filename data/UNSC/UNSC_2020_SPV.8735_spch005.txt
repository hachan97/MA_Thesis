Mr. Ben Lagha (Tunisia): I deliver this statement on behalf of the three African members of the Security Council - the Niger, South Africa and Tunisia - as well as Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. At the outset, we would like to express our thanks to the Chair of the Security Council Committee pursuant to resolution 751 (1992), concerning Somalia, for his briefing on the work of the Sanctions Committee and on the recent field visit he undertook to Somalia in January. That visit clearly demonstrates the determination of the international community and the United Nations to continue to support Somalia to achieve stability and development and engage in the reconstruction phase. Our delegations believe that sanctions are not an end in themselves and that they should constitute a tool to assist and support the Somalia Government in its stabilization efforts. We would like to take this opportunity to commend the Somali Federal Government for its determination to hold elections within the established timeline. We would therefore like to appeal to all Somali parties to put the national interests above any other considerations and to fully engage in a constructive dialogue to promote genuine consensus on building an inclusive Somali State. We call on the international community to continue to provide all support to the Federal Government of Somalia with a view to enabling it to hold the elections within its set timeline, which would open up new prospects for the Somali people to lay the foundation for stability and reconstruction.
