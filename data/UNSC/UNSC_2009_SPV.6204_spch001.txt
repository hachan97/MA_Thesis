The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Council agrees to
extend an invitation under rule 39 of its provisional

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Mulet to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Council will now begin its consideration of
the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
