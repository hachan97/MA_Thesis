Mr. Loulichki (Morocco) (spoke in French): I
would like to thank you, Mr. President, for delivering
that important statement at the enf of our debate. I also
thank you for your patience and perseverance in pursuit
of ensuring the text's adoption.

The presidential statement (S/PRST/2012/20)
constitutes a plus for the United Nations and for the
League of Arab States. Given the unprecedented efforts
that have characterized the actions of the League of
Arab States over the past few months, this statement
is certainly well-deserved. But it is also something
that the United Nations wanted. It serves as a further
milestone in strengthening relations between the United
Nations and the League of Arab States. We would like
to express our great satisfaction at the fact that the
statement's last paragraph leaves the door open to even
greater cooperation and strengthening of institutional
relations.
