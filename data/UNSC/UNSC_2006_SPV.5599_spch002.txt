Mrs. Collet (France) (spoke in French): France
welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 1730
(2006), which is the result of the reaching of fresh
insights and of a collective effort pursued, in particular,
within the Security Council Committee established
pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999) concerning
Al-Qaida and the Taliban. It is a meaningful
contribution to improving delisting procedures for
sanctions committee lists.

With the development of sanctions regimes aimed
at individuals or entities, rather than at countries, the
2
inadequacy of delisting procedures has gradually
become apparent. There has been a widespread sense
that, once a name has been added to a list, it is difficult
to delist it and to plead one's case, since the procedure
has been so opaque and inaccessible. That has affected
the efficacy of sanctions.

The procedure we have just adopted, which
complements that for States' submission of requests,
enables individuals and entities that have been listed to
present their petitions for delisting directly to a focal
point created to that end within the Secretariat. As in
the various sanctions committees, the new mechanism
will make the procedure more accessible, clearer and
standardized. It will also ensure that all submissions
will be considered by the sanctions committees within
a reasonable delay. It therefore represents considerable
progress in terms of equity and transparency.

My country expresses the hope that, by thus
facilitating requests for delisting, the new procedure
will strengthen the support of States for the sanctions
regimes. France is convinced that such support will
guarantee the effectiveness of targeted sanctions, an
important instrument in the maintenance of
international peace and security.
