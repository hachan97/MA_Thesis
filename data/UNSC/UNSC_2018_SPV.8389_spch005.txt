Mr. Cohen (United States of America): Today's
vote to renew the mandate authorizing Security Council
sanctions on illicit petroleum exports from Libya
and asset freezes and travel bans on Libyan political
spoilers should have been unanimous. It should have
sent a clear message to the Libyan people that we are
united behind them and that we on the Security Council
will hold Libyan spoilers to account for their actions.

The Security Council unanimously agreed to list
six migrant smugglers earlier this year for their abuses
in Libya, marking the very first time that we have
ever used sanctions to respond to migrant trafficking.
These criminal gangs cannot operate with impunity,
and we remain deeply concerned about the welfare of
the migrants they seek to exploit. We also unanimously
agreed in September to list Libyan militia leader Ibrahim
Jadhran for attacking Libya's oil facilities earlier this
summer. That should be a warning to others who may
try to seize Libya's resources for themselves, and this
mandate clearly authorizes the Security Council to act
in the future.

One key factor that has not changed in Libya is the
potential of the Libyan people and their desire to create
a better country for themselves. The Security Council
must continue to do its part.
