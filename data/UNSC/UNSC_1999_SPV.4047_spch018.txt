The President: I thank President Chiluba for the
clarifications he has provided in response to the questions
put to him by members of the Council. I do not believe
that we are going to make him work overtime.
I see that there are no further speakers inscribed on
my list.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 5.30 p.m.
