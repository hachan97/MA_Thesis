The President: I thank the representative of New
Zealand for the kind words he addressed to me, which
were somewhat outside the newly agreed upon practice.
Since we are outside that practice, let me add that I
understand that the representative of New Zealand is
leaving New York for good. We wish him well.

The next speaker is the representative of Ireland. I
invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make
his statement.
