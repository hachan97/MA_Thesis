The President: I thank the representative of
Germany for his comments on cooperative and
effective multilateralism. That should, indeed, be the
guiding principle in addressing threats to international
peace and security, as well as in achieving greater
coherence and, eventually, a structured approach to
cooperation between the United Nations and regional
organizations.
