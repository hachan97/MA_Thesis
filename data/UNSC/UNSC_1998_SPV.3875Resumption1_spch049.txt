The President: I thank the representative of
Lebanon for his kind words addressed to me and to my
predecessor.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the Most
Reverend Secretary for Relations with States of the Holy
See, Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran. In accordance with
the decision taken earlier in the meeting, I welcome the
Most Reverend Secretary for Relations with States of the
Holy See and invite him to take a seat at the Council
table and to make his statement.
