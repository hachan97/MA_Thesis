The President: Cooperation between the United
Nations and regional organizations, as well as among
regional and subregional organizations, should be
further encouraged. Romania takes seriously the
commitment to continue this important debate, which
began in the past with our Mexican friends and will
continue with other members of the Council in future
years. I am very encouraged by the statement by the
representative of the Philippines.

I now invite the Deputy Executive Secretary of
the Commonwealth of Independent States, His
Excellency Mr. Dimitry Boulakhov, to take the floor.
