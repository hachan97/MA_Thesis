Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
wish to thank Under-Secretary-General Lacroix and
Ms. Bachelet, United Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights, for their briefings. We listened very
carefully to the intervention of Ms. Viaud. I welcome
the presence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Haiti
in the Chamber today.

The recent political situation in Haiti remains
complex, with challenging economic and humanitarian
situations. China hopes that the Haitian Government
can assume responsibility for maintaining the country's
stability and development, enhance its development
capacity, strengthen the rule of law, conduct a
constructive nation-wide dialogue and properly
resolve differences through consultations so that the
overall security and development of the country can be
achieved as soon as possible and the people of Haiti can
live and work in peace. The United Nations Mission
for Justice Support in Haiti (MINUJUSTH) and
Special Representative La Lime have made significant
efforts to maintain stability in Haiti and to promote
the capacity-building of relevant departments of the
Haitian Government. China commends them for that.

The Mission will conclude its work in October
of this year. China supports the Secretary-General's
road map for drawdown and exit. The Mission should
continue to transfer responsibility to the Haitian
Government in a steady and orderly manner and
complete the drawdown and exit on schedule. With
regard to the transition to a special political mission
following MINUJUSTH, the members of the Security
Council, the Secretariat, the Haitian Government and
other stakeholders should fully discuss the relevant
issues. The Haitian Government should continue to
strengthen its coordination and collaboration with the
United Nations to ensure a smooth transition.
