The President (interpretation from Spanish): I should

the representatives of Afghanistan, Algeria, Colombia,
Cuba, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait,
Lebanon, the Libyan Arab J amahiriya, Malaysia, Morocco,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia,
Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, in which they
request to be invited to participate in the discussion of the
item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the discussion,
without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Yaacobi (Israel)
and Mr. Moubarak (Lebanon) took seats at the
Council table; Mr. Farhadi (Afghanistan),

Chamber.

The President (interpretation from Spanish): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
response to the request contained in a letter dated 13 April
1996 from the Permanent Representative of Lebanon to the
United Nations addressed to the President of the Security
Council (5/1996/280).

The first speaker is the representative of Lebanon,
on whom I now call.
