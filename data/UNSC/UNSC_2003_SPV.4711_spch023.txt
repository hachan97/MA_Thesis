Mr. Vassilev (Bulgaria): First of all, I would like
to thank you, Sir, for organizing this important meeting
on the security situation in Afghanistan and for giving
us the chance to listen to such excellent briefings by
Ambassador Nishimura, Ambassador Braun and
Mr. Guehenno. We do appreciate the work done and
coordinated by Ambassador Nishimura and
Ambassador Braun.

In that context, let me just join previous speakers
in expressing our condolences over the tragic incident
in which Pakistani and Afghan officials were killed in
an air crash.

Let me inform the Council that, on 20 February,
the third rotation of the Bulgarian contingent in the
International Security Assistance Force took place in
accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security
Council.

Because many questions have already been asked,
I feel that it will be quite difficult for the briefers to
answer all of them. Would it simply be possible for
them to share with us some preliminary views on the
efficiency of the measures taken up to now by the
international community and the respective lead
countries?
