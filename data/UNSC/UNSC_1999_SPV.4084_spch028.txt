Mr. Hasmy (Malaysia): I would just like to remind
the representative of the Netherlands that, in addition to
China, France and the Russian Federation, Malaysia too
abstained in the vote on the resolution just adopted by the
Council. My delegation would like to stress that while
Malaysia is not a permanent member, it is nevertheless a
full, functioning and voting member of the Council, and
has just exercised its right to vote on a draft resolution,
on which it abstained for reasons my delegation made
clear in its earlier statement.

On the process that led to this vote, my delegation
is of the View that if the issue had been properly
discussed and negotiated among all 15 permanent and
non-permanent members at every stage of the
consultations and negotiations, the outcome might well
have been quite different.
