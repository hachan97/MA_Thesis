The President: I thank Mr. De Gucht for the
clarifications he has provided.

Once again, I thank the Minister for Foreign
Affairs of Belgium for having come to brief the
Security Council this morning.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 11.35 am.
