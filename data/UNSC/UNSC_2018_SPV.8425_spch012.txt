Mr. Kuzmin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We have studied the twenty-eighth report
of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court
(ICC) on the investigation of the situation in Darfur.
We discovered two lines in paragraph 22 with a
puzzling sentence about some apparently significant
progress in the investigation. That was all there was
about the investigation. For the remainder of the report,
the Office of the Prosecutor busied itself tracking the
international visits of President Omar Al-Bashir of
the Sudan.

As I understand it, we are seeing the emergence
of a new and fascinating topic, which is holding States
accountable for violating their obligations to cooperate
with the ICC. That is undoubtedly less time-consuming
and costly than the scrupulous gathering of evidence of
the crimes committed by all the parties to a conflict - I
repeat, by all the parties to a conflict - interviewing
victims and witnesses and so forth. Am I right?

Meanwhile, the President of the Sudan, like
any other president, enjoys immunity from foreign
criminal jurisdiction. That immunity continues to be
in effect after a situation is referred to the ICC. In not
cooperating with the ICC, States, including parties to
the Rome Statute, are acting in accordance with their
international legal obligations, and our position on the
issue has not changed. We urge the ICC to focus on
its main functions and to finally begin an objective,
comprehensive investigation of the situation in Darfur.
