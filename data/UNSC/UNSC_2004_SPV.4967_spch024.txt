Mr. Hannesson (Iceland): Iceland, as a member
of the European Economic Area, aligns itself fully with
the statement just made by Ambassador Richard Ryan
on behalf of the European Union, including its
welcome to Mr. Harri Holkeri and its strong support
for his work and that of the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the
Kosovo Force (KFOR). I would also like, as others
have done, to state our appreciation to the Minister for
Foreign Affairs of Serbia and Montenegro for his
participation here today.

Iceland recognizes, along with its partners, the
need for long-term practical commitment to the
rebuilding of the western Balkan region. In that spirit,
at the request of the Secretary-General of NATO,
Iceland took over the running of the Pristina airport in
March 2003; the personnel included some 200 persons
from 13 countries. Iceland provided both air traffic
controllers and firefighting personnel. During that
period the management of the airport has been
upgraded to full International Civil Aviation
Organization standards. In looking to future
sustainability, Iceland has emphasized the preparation
of local operatives. Some 50 firefighters and 20 air
traffic controllers have received training. UNMIK has
now taken over control of the airport but will continue
to be assisted by the Icelandic Civil Aviation
Administration on a contractual basis.

We emphasize the need for continuation of the
peaceful economic and social reconstruction of
Kosovo, including a constructive confidence-building
dialogue between the communities. We urge the parties
concerned to cooperate fully with UNMIK and KFOR
and to renounce violence, and thereby to facilitate the
political process designed to determine Kosovo's
future based on Security Council resolution 1244
(1999).
