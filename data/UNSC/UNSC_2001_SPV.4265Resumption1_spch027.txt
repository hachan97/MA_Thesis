The President: I thank the representative of Fiji
for the kind words he addressed to me.

Before I give the floor to the next speaker, I
would like to note here that Jose' Ramos-Horta has
asked to say a few words. He has to catch a plane this
evening, and as we all know, getting to Kennedy
Airport on Friday evening can be very, very difficult.
So I will give him a chance to speak before leaving for
the airport.
