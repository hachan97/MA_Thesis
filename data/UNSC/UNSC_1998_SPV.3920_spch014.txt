Mr. Dangue Rewaka (Gabon) (interpretation from French): The decision of the American and British
Governments to agree to have the two Libyans suspected of
carrying out the attacks against UTA flight 772 and Pan
Am flight 103 tried in the Netherlands by Scottish judges
in accordance with Scottish law responds to one of the
proposals made on several occasions by both the
Organization of African Unity and the League of Arab
States. We can only welcome this decision.

In fact, this decision may make possible a resolution
of this dispute, which has lasted for 10 years and which has
threatened to affect international relations.

Similarly, it gives hope to the families of Victims, who
have waited for so long for justice to be done, and to the
Libyan people, who have suffered so much from the
negative effects of sanctions.

For our part, we are convinced that the parties will do
their utmost to ensure that a solution is found to the
technical issues inherent in the specific nature of the court
provided for in paragraph 2 of the draft resolution before us

 

which will lead the Council to lift the measures taken in
accordance with resolutions 748 (1992) of 31 March 1992
and 883 (1993) of 8 November 1993.

Finally, we request the Secretary-General to ensure
that all security conditions will be guaranteed for the two
accused upon their arrival in the Netherlands and
throughout the trial. It is in this spirit that my delegation
will vote in favour of the draft resolution before us.
