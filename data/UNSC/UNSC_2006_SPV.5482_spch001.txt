The President (spoke in French): As this is the
first meeting of the Security Council for the month of
July, I should like to take this opportunity to pay
tribute, on behalf of the Council, to our colleague Her
Excellency Ms. Ellen Margrethe Loj, Permanent
Representative of Denmark to the United Nations, for
her service as President of the Security Council for the
month of June 2006. I am sure I speak for all members
of the Security Council in expressing my deep
appreciation to Ambassador Loj for the great
diplomatic skill with which she conducted the
Council's business last month.
