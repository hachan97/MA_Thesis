Mr. Wehbe (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): I would not have wanted to intervene at this
point in the meeting, but since this will be the last
Council meeting I shall attend, I would like, Sir, at this
very first meeting of your presidency to begin by
congratulating you. I am confident that you will lead
the Council's deliberations this month with your well-
known wisdom and diplomatic expertise. We know that
you will lead the Council to success. This month is full
of events, notably a meeting at the level of Foreign
Ministers, who will be here in New York for the
opening of the fifty-eighth session of the General
Assembly.

I would like to thank you wholeheartedly, Sir, for
the kind words you addressed to me. I also take this
occasion to thank all the Permanent Representatives on
the Security Council, and the members of their
delegations, for the cooperation and assistance they
extended to me, as well as for the coordination they all
undertook to ensure international peace and security. I
wish each and every one of them success in their
endeavours.
