Mr. De Riviere (France) (spoke in French): France welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 2536 (2020), which renews the sanctions regime concerning the Central African Republic for one year. In that regard, I would like to highlight three points.First of all, I would like to express our satisfaction that the Security Council is demonstrating its unity onthe Central African Republic issue. That unity is crucial to the support that we are providing to the Central African Republic at a time marked by the implementation of the peace agreement, preparations for the presidential and legislative elections in 2020 and 2021 and the fight against the coronavirus disease pandemic. From the beginning of the negotiations, we therefore chose to adopt a pragmatic approach and strived throughout to play the role of constructive facilitator. As such, I would therefore like to thank all the members of the Security Council for their flexibility. Next, I would like to reaffirm the fact that the Security Council remains fully attentive to the legitimate concerns of the Central African authorities regarding the security of their country. That is why, from the outset of the negotiations, we took the lead in proposing to the members of the Security Council to work towards a further, limited easing of the arms embargo. Our objective was to meet a specific need of the Central African security forces based on a realistic analysis of the security situation in the country. To facilitate the equipping of those forces, the Security Council will therefore have authorized three relaxations of the arms embargo in almost a year. The Central African authorities also continue to benefit from the exemption procedures provided for and regularly granted by the sanctions committee.
