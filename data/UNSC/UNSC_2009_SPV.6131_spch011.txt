The President (spoke in Russian): As President
of the Council, I am obliged to note the following. First
of all, Ambassador Urbina felt it necessary to interpret
in his own way the results of the discussion of this
issue that took place very briefly during the Council's
consultations. At that time, Ambassador Urbina agreed
to my conclusion that this issue needed to be discussed
further in preparing for forthcoming missions of the
Security Council.

Secondly, as President of the Council, I am
compelled to point out that the preparations for this
meeting did not involve an understanding that we
would discuss procedural issues for preparing Security
Council missions in a formal meeting of the Security
Council.

Thirdly, as President of the Security Council and
as the Permanent Representative of a permanent
member of the Council, I am compelled to express
regret that, in his remarks, Ambassador Urbina sought
to introduce some sort of artificial dividing line
between permanent members of the Security Council
and the elected members of the Security Council, and
between Member States and the Secretariat, with which
we cooperate very closely in preparing for missions of
the Security Council.

The meeting rose at 3.45 p.m.
