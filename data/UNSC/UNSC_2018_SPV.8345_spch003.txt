The President: I thank Mr. De Mistura for
his briefing.

During this presidency, we are holding all meetings
in the open. We want to hear from Mr. De Mistura
what the civilians have to say and what they think. We
would appreciate it if he would say that publicly and
let us know what he thinks. If he has any additional
comments after we are done, we are more than happy to
hear those, if he is comfortable with that being public.

I once again give the floor to Mr. De Mistura.
