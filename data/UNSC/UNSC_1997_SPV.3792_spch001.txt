The President (interpretation from Russian): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of item
2 of the agenda. The Security Council is meeting today in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them document
S/1997/479, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by Chile, Costa Rica, Japan, Poland, Portugal,
Sweden, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland and the United States of America. The Republic of
Korea has also become one of the sponsors of the draft
resolution.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to the following other documents: S/ 1997/462,
S/1997/465, S/1997/473 and S/1997/481, letters from the
Permanent Representative of Iraq to the United Nations
dated 14, 16, 18 and 20 June 1997, respectively, addressed
to the President of the Security Council; and documents
S/1997/474 and S/1997/475, letters from the Executive
Chairman of the Special Commission established by the
Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 9 (b) (i) of
Security Council resolution 687 (1991) dated 12 and 19
June 1997, respectively, addressed to the President of the
Security Council.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless
I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the
vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the voting.
