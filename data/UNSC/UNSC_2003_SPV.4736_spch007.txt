Mr. Schumacher (Germany): I thank Mr. Morris
very much for a superb presentation and, in particular,
for his continuous efforts to brief the Council. I would
like to challenge somewhat one of the initial
observations that he made in saying that we routinely
accept a situation in Africa that we would not
otherwise accept in other parts of the world. Are we
really routinely accepting such a situation in Africa? Is
it not more something like, may I say, donor fatigue?

I recall correctly that some 10 years ago, there
was another serious food crisis in Southern Africa, and
the international community responded very efficiently
to the call of the WFP and others to cope with that
crisis. Now, we are again faced with the same situation.

Mr. Morris mentioned that there are two
intertwined problems - the scourge of HIV/AIDS and
the food crisis - and he and others have vaguely
referred to man-made problems. Are there not three
intertwined elements that create the deadly brew that
makes it almost impossible to cope with these sorts of
problems worldwide? Is not the combination of bad
governance, HIV/AIDS and the food crisis the problem
that we are facing today?

In that context, my question is the following.
Would Mr. Morris agree that, without a sound approach
to the establishment of good governance worldwide,
any isolated effort to come to grips with HIV/AIDS or
the food crisis would remain a piecemeal approach? I
should like to recall that good governance is an
important element and an important objective in the
Millennium Declaration, which was adopted by our
heads of State three years ago. Unfortunately, it does
not fall under the heading of "Millennium
Development Goals". I very much hope that, when
Millennium Development Goals are mentioned in
future discussions of this issue as a justified appeal to
donors to help us cope with these problems, this third
element of good governance also becomes an important
objective.
