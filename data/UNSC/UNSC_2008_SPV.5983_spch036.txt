Mr. Arias (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): Panama
recognizes the importance of this meeting, which was
convened at the request of Saudi Arabia with the aim
of briefing the Security Council on the extension and
consequences of the occupation of Palestinian
territories by Israel.

In that regard, Panama is aware that the situation
in the Middle East is too complex to focus merely on
one aspect of the conflict. At the same time, Panama
reiterates that the occupation of Palestinian territory by
Israel, besides being illegal and in violation of the
human rights of the Palestinian people, is a significant
obstacle to progress in the peace process and the early
establishment of two States, Israel and Palestine, living
in peace and harmony between themselves and with
their neighbours. We therefore echo the resounding call
of the international community for Israel to
immediately cease the construction of settlements in
Palestinian territories.
