The President: There are no further speakers on
my list. It is my understanding that the Council is
ready to proceed to the adoption of its annual report.

May I take it that the draft report is adopted by
the Council?

There being no objection, it is so decided.
09-58302
This decision will be reflected in a note by the
President of the Security Council to be issued as
document S/2009/559.

The Security Council has thus concluded its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

As this may be, and hopefully is, the last Council
meeting under the presidency of Viet Nam, I wish to
09-58302

take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to
all of my colleagues in the Council, who have extended
most valuable cooperation to my delegation. I also
wish to thank the Council Secretariat team for its
continued support throughout the month and all those
in the Secretariat staff who have worked behind the
scenes in supporting the work of the presidency.

The meeting rose at 12.10p.m.
