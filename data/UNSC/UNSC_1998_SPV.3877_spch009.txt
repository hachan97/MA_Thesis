Mr. Amorim (Brazil): The genocide in Rwanda is
one of the most tragic events of the last decades. There is
a prevailing feeling that the international community
could have done better and that steps could have been
taken to avoid the massacres. Given the difficulties faced
by the Rwandan judiciary system, the International
Tribunal has become an increasingly relevant tool for
ensuring the fair trial of those involved in the genocide,
thus contributing to peace and reconciliation in Rwanda.

The increase in the number of indicted persons
justifies the addition of a third Trial Chamber. The
decision the Council is about to take, which we support,
takes into account the political factors involved and is a
signal to the Rwandan people that the international
community is ready to assume its share in the process of
healing the wounds of the terrible events of 1994.

The clear commitment of the Tribunal to enhance its
efficiency and improve its administrative practices was
yet another key element that made consensus on this issue
possible.

In view of the well-known positions of Brazil on
human rights in general and on the death penalty in
particular, let me state that it is our hope that an
expanded and more efficient International Tribunal for
Rwanda may render executions such as the ones we have
witnessed recently less likely in the future.
