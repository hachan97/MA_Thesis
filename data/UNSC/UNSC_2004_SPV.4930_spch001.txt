The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them a letter
dated 18 March 2004 from the Secretary-General
addressed to the President of the Security Council,
which is contained in document S/2004/225.

After consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council.

"The Security Council welcomes the
Secretary-General's letter dated 18 March and the
exchange of letters with Dr. Bahr Al-Uloom,
Interim President of the Iraqi Governing Council
for the month of March 2004, and Ambassador
L. Paul Bremer III, Administrator of the Coalition
Provisional Authority.

"The Security Council also welcomes and
strongly supports the Secretary-General's
decision to dispatch to Iraq his Special Adviser,
Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, and his team, as well as an
electoral assistance team, as soon as possible, in
order to lend assistance and advice to the Iraqi
people on the formation of an interim Iraqi
Government to which sovereignty will be
transferred on 30 June 2004, as well as on the
preparations for direct elections to be held before
the end of January 2005.

"The Security Council calls on all parties in
Iraq to cooperate fully with these United Nations
teams, and welcomes the security and other
support provided to them by the Iraqi Governing
Council and the Coalition Provisional Authority."

This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2004/6.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
