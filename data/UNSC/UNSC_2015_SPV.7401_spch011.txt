Ms. Power (United States of America): I will be
extremely brief. I would just refer Council members and
anybody watching this meeting to the reports that have
been prepared by the experts of the fact-finding mission
of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons. I would not myself deign to weigh in at the
level of detail as somebody who is a diplomat and not a
chemical weapons expert. I would note, however, that
the Council, in the wake of the monstrous attack in
August 2013, came together and did decide, very much
with the Russian Federation's support and partnership,
to take away one party's chemical weapons. It is a little
strange to take away one party's entire stockpile of
chemical weapons in the wake of a monstrous attack
and then later claim that the party whose chemical
weapons one has taken away is not implicated in that
attack.
