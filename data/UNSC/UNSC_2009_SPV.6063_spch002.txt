The Secretary-General: For the past two weeks,
people around the world have observed with grief and
horror the escalating violence and suffering in Gaza
and southern Israel and have looked to the United
Nations to put an end to the fighting. I am heartened
and relieved at the adoption by the Council today of a
resolution to bring an end to that tragic situation. The
Council's decision signals the will of the international
community. It must be fully respected by all parties to
this conflict.

The resolution calls for an immediate and durable
ceasefire in and from Gaza. That will open the way for
09-20414
the United Nations to resume urgently the delivery of
humanitarian aid, food and medical supplies. All
parties in Israel and Gaza will need to respect that
humanitarian effort.

We also need to turn quickly to the process of
rebuilding what has been destroyed in the fighting. The
United Nations stands ready to assist in and support
that process.

An immediate and durable ceasefire is the first
step. However, we also all know that more will be
needed and that a political way forward is required to
deliver long-term security and peace.

My visit to the region next week will focus on
helping to ensure that the ceasefire is implemented and
that urgent humanitarian assistance reaches those in
need and on encouraging the diplomatic efforts
currently under way.
