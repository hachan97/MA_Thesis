The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank
the representative of Guinea-Bissau for the kind words he
addressed to Costa Rica and to Ambassador Berrocal
Soto.

I should like to inform the Council that I have
received a letter from the representative of Argentina, in
which he requests to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to

 

participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Petrella
(Argentina) took the seat reserved for him at the side
of the Council Chamber.

The President (interpretation from Spanish): The next
speaker is the representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina, on
whom I now call.
