Mr. Kasse (Mali) (spoke in French): We too
thank Mr. Annabi for his comprehensive briefing on
the matter before the Council today. We reaffirm our
full support for the United Nations Transitional
Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), which has
done outstanding work in implementing its mandate.
As Mr. Annabi has said, the way to independence is
now open. We believe that, at this very delicate stage
and more than ever before, UNTAET needs the full
support of the international community and of donors.

We applaud recent decisions taken by the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sergio
Vieira de Mello. In that connection, my delegation
earnestly hopes that the elections scheduled for this
summer will be well organized, free, transparent and,
above all, inclusive. We echo the comments made
today by the representative of Ireland about women and
by the representative of Tunisia about cooperation with
Indonesia on security matters.

At this stage, many of my questions have already
been asked and Mr. Annabi has already answered most
of them. But, without being pessimistic, I would note
that the timeframe for the elections is very short, as Mr.
Annabi has told us. Could the date of the elections be
flexible, to make it possible for all refugees to return
and to participate in the electoral process?
