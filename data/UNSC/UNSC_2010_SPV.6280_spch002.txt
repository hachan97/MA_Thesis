Mr. Takasu (Japan): I would like to congratulate
you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the
Council for this month. I add my voice to yours in
thanking Ambassador Araud and the French delegation
for their excellent work during the month of February.

I have the honour to present the report of the
1737 Committee here today. This is the thirteenth
90-day report to the Security Council in accordance
with paragraph 18 (h) of resolution 1737 (2006). The
report covers the period from ll December 2009 to 4
March 2010, during which time the Committee held no
meetings but conducted its work using the silence
procedure.

In the previous report, I informed the Council
that the Committee had received two reports of
violations of paragraph 5 of resolution 1747 (2007),
2

which imposed an export ban on arms and related
materiel on the Islamic Republic of Iran. I also
informed the Council that the Committee had
dispatched letters to the two States involved in the
transfer of the arms-related materiel from Iran found
onboard the M/V Hansa India and the M/V Francop,
respectively, inviting them to provide an explanation
for the transactions as well as additional relevant
information about the origin, final destination and
ownership of the goods. During the current reporting
period, the Committee received a response from one of
those States: the State of destination identified in the
Hansa India bill of lading.

The State asserted that it had found no record
indicating that the Hansa India was destined for one of
its ports and that it was conducting investigations, the
results of which it would share with the Committee.
The Committee has not yet received any further
information from this State on this matter.

Subsequently, the same State, which was also
mentioned as the State of destination in the Francop
bill of lading, wrote to the Committee on that latter
case, though not in direct response to the Committee's
letter. The State asserted that the allegations made
against it were false, and that the F rancop had not been
carrying any materiel that pertained to it. To date, there
has been no response from the reported State of origin.

On 20 January 2010, the Committee approved a
second implementation assistance notice containing
information that might prove to be useful to Member
States in implementing their obligations under
resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007) and 1803 (2008).
The notice provided a summary of the facts involved in
the Hansa India incident and urged all Member States
to be especially alert for additional violations involving
similar circumstances. The Committee also highlighted
paragraph 7 of resolution 1803 (2008), in which the
Council decided that the targeted financial measures
shall also apply to

"persons and entities determined by the Council
or the Committee to have assisted designated
persons or entities in evading sanctions of, or in
violating the provisions of, [the relevant
resolutions]".

Members will recall that the first implementation
assistance notice of 24 July 2009 contained an incident
report and conclusions concerning the arms-related
materiel found on board the M/V Monchegorsk and the
10-25834
involvement of the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping
Lines (IRISL). Similarly, this second notice addressed
the arms-related materiel found on board the Hansa
India, also highlighted the repeated involvement of
IRISL and noted the similar circumstances of the two
cases, namely the same destination and originating
States. Both notices are available on the Committee's
website. In line with its mandate, the Committee will
continue to explore options for responding effectively
to this pattern of repeated sanctions violations.

During the reporting period, the Committee
received three notifications from a Member State with
reference to paragraph 5 of resolution 1737 (2006),
concerning the delivery of items for use in the nuclear
power plant in Bushehr, Iran. The Committee also
received one notification pursuant to paragraph 15 of
resolution 1737 (2006), in connection with the
unfreezing of funds to make payments for contracts
entered into prior to the listing of two entities. In
addition, the Committee received, and responded to, a
written query from a Member State concerning certain
aspects of the sanctions regime.

Finally, with regard to reporting by States on the
implementation of all relevant measures set out in
resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007) and 1803 (2008),
the figures remain as follows: 91 reports under
resolution 1737 (2006), 78 reports under resolution
1747 (2007) and 67 reports under resolution 1803
(2008).
