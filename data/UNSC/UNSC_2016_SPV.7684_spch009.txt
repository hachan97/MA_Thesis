Mr. Ibrahim (Malaysia): I thank the Permanent
Mission of the United States for preparing the text of
resolution 2285 (2016), given the delicate circumstances
involved. Malaysia voted in favour of the resolution,
which renews the mandate of the United Nations Mission
for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO)
for another year and emphasizes the urgent need for
MINURSO to return to full functionality, as we are
mindful of the importance of preserving the integrity
and ability of MINURSO to fulfil its mandate as
stipulated in the Council's resolutions.

The ongoing operation of MINURSO is
indispensable to stability and security in Western
Sahara. We reiterate Malaysia's principal positions on
the need to resolve conflicts through peaceful means,
as well as our firm commitment and support for United
Nations peacekeeping operations as a tool for the
maintenance of international peace and security. We
would like to underscore Malaysia's continued support
for the efforts of MINURSO, as well as that of the
Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy, Ambassador
Christopher Ross, to achieve ajust, lasting and mutually
acceptable political solution, which will provide for the
self-determination of the people of Western Sahara,
based on the relevant Security Council resolutions, as
well as on respect for the principles and purposes of the
Charter of the United Nations and international law. In
that regard, we would like to emphasize the importance
of full cooperation by all parties with the efforts of
the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General and with
MINURSO in order to enable them to perform the tasks
mandated by the Council.

Lastly, we would have hoped for a broad,
inclusive and transparent consultation process on
draft resolutions that would take into consideration the
legitimate concerns and views of all Council members.
Sufficient time for consultations would enable us to seek
clarity on the issues at hand, consider sensible options
and determine the guiding principles for consensus-
building measures.
