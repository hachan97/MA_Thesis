Mr. Choat (South Sudan): I would like to express
my appreciation to the Republic of South Africa for
convening this meeting and to you, Madam President,
for presiding over the discussion.

The Republic of South Sudan is concerned about
the security situation in Darfur. We believe that
insecurity in any part of our region, including in the
Republic of the Sudan, has the potential to affect the
security situation in our country. It is our view that the
Darfur crisis needs to be resolved through negotiation
and a political settlement. We encourage all parties to
enter rapidly into political negotiations in a spirit of
goodwill and compromise.

The Republic of South Sudan notes that the
situation in Darfur is not entirely isolated from the
other challenges facing the two Sudans. We
respectfully invite members of the Council to take the
wider political and security context into consideration
during its discussions. For example, the ongoing
situation in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states
could have an effect on the dynamics of the situation in
Darfur. We encourage the international community to
consider the challenges of the region in a broad
manner, as that will be the most effective way to
maintain and strengthen peace and security in the long
term.

The Republic of South Sudan remains fully
committed to resolving all outstanding issues between
Sudan and South Sudan in a full and comprehensive
manner. We hope that progress made in the
negotiations between our two countries might also
positively influence the chances for progress in Darfur
and in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states, so that
all of the peoples of the Sudan can enjoy the lasting
and permanent peace that they deserve.
