The President: I thank Ms. Raemer for her briefing.

I would like to draw the attention of speakers to
paragraph 22 of presidential note S/2017/507, which
encourages all participants in Council meetings to
deliver their statements in five minutes or less, in line
with the Security Council's commitment to making
more effective use of open meetings.

I now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements.
