Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
welcomes the Security Council's unanimous adoption
today of resolution 2261 (2016), on the establishment
of a United Nations mission in Colombia. I would also
like to welcome the Foreign Minister of Uruguay as he
presides over today's meeting, as well as Ms. Holguin
Cuellar, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Colombia.
Colombia's peace process has recently made major
progress. The Government and the Fuerzas Armadas
Revolucionarias de Colombia are expected to sign a
peace agreement that marks the end of a civil war that
has lasted approximately half a century. That will not
only help to achieve peace and stability in Colombia
soon, it will contribute greatly to the promotion of
stability and development in the region. It will also serve
as an important example for finding solutions to other
hotspot issues. China welcomes this development and
commends the efforts of the Colombian Government
and the relevant parties to conduct a dialogue for peace.
We also greatly appreciate the important role that
Ms. Holguin Cuellar played in the process.

China hopes that the Security Council's unanimous
adoption of resolution 2261 (2016) will help to
encourage the signing and full implementation of
a final peace agreement by all the parties involved
as soon as possible. We support the United Nations,
on the basis of respect for Colombia's sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity, in accordance
with the needs of the Colombian Government, in its
work to prepare to speedily deploy a mission aimed at
providing constructive assistance to the peace process.
China is ready to engage with Council members and
the international community to work tirelessly to
achieve peace, stability, development and prosperity in
Colombia and the entire region as soon as possible.
