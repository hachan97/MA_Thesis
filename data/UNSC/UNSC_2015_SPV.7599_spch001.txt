The President: The Security Council will now

begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

After consultations among Council members, I

have been authorized to make the following statement
on their behalf:

"The Security Council recalls the issue of
consultations between the Security Council,
troop- and police-contributing countries and the
Secretariat - triangular consultations - and the
report of its Working Group on United Nations
Peacekeeping Operations on the enhancement of
cooperation with troop-contributing countries,
police-contributing countries and other
stakeholders of 17 December 2009 (S/2009/659),
its resolutions 1353 (2001) and 2086 (2013), the
notes by its President of 26 July 2010 (S/2010/507)
and 28 October 2013 (S/2013/630), and the
statement by its President of 25 November 2015
(S/PRST/2015/22).

"The Security Council takes note of the
recommendations of the Secretary-General's
report entitled 'The future of United Nations
peace operations: implementation of the
recommendations of the High-Level Independent
Panel on Peace Operations' (S/2015/682) and of
the recommendations of the report of the High-
level Independent Panel on Peace Operations
(S/2015/446), with respect to consultations between
the Security Council, troop- and police-contributing
countries and the Secretariat. The Security Council
notes in particular the View of the High-Level
Independent Panel and the Secretary-General that
the lack of effective dialogue through consultations
between these three stakeholders has generated
frustration on all sides and has undermined
mandate implementation.

"The Security Council takes note of the Views
expressed at the ninth meeting ofits Working Group
on the theme 'Towards a strategic dialogue between
the Security Council, troop- and police-contributing

countries and the Secretariat', held on 11 December
2015 under Chad's chairmanship.

"The Security Council recognizes that
sustained consultations with the Secretariat and
troop- and police-contributing countries are
essential for a shared understanding of appropriate
responses and their implications for the mandate
and conduct of an operation. In this regard, the
Security Council recalls the many mechanisms that
exist to facilitate consultations among the Security
Council, troop- and police-contributing countries
and the Secretariat, particularly the Working Group,
formal and informal consultations with troop- and
police-contributing countries, as well as the role
of the General Assembly's Special Committee on
Peacekeeping Operations and the Military Staff
Committee. The Security Council recognizes that,
despite the existence of these mechanisms, current
consultations among these three stakeholders do
not meet their expectations and have yet to reach
their full potential.

"The Security Council recognizes that the
experience and expertise of troop- and police-
contributing countries in theatres of operation
can greatly assist the planning of operations.
The Security Council stresses the importance
of substantive, representative and meaningful
exchanges and underscores the importance of
full participation by the three stakeholders, so
that meetings are useful and productive. The
Security Council acknowledges the importance
of effective consultations among the Security
Council, troop- and police-contributing countries
and the Secretariat, and that these consultations
must extend beyond the issue of mandates of
operations and to areas such as safety and security
ofpeacekeepers, strategic force generation, gender,
conduct and discipline, including allegations of
sexual exploitation and abuse, implementation
of protection of civilian mandates, capability,
performance, equipment and national caveats.

"The Security Council recalls its presidential
statement of 31 January 2001 (S/PRST/2001/3),
by which it established its Working Group to,
where appropriate, seek the views of troop- and
police-contributing countries, including through
meetings between the Working Group and troop-
and police-contributing countries, with their views
being taken into account by the Security Council.

The Security Council stresses the usefulness of
full and comprehensive briefings by the Secretariat
at private meetings and the importance of full
participation by all those involved, including
troop- and police-contributing countries taking
the initiative to call for meaningful exchanges
of information. The Security Council views
consultations with troop- and police-contributing
countries as an opportunity to set expectations for
the required capabilities, performance standards and
timelines, as well as to understand the limitations of
troop- and police-contributing countries. Recalling
operative paragraph 7 of resolution 2242 (2015),
the Security Council underlines that such briefings
must include the appropriate information in order
to ensure that a gender perspective is taken into
account in the planning of new missions and the
review of existing ones.

"The Security Council encourages the
Secretariat to further provide to relevant troop-
and police-contributing countries, information, as
appropriate and in a timely manner, in particular
related to critical security incidents within missions.
The Security Council welcomes developments in
the informal approach to consultations between the
three stakeholders, as reflected in the report on the
activities of its Working Group on Peacekeeping
Operations for the period 1 January to 31 December
2015. The Security Council strongly encourages
its members to continue to hold and further
develop such informal, interactive and focused
consultations with the Secretariat and troop- and
police-contributing countries.

"The Security Council underscores that
sustained consultations with potential troop-
and police-contributing countries prior to the
establishment and during the lifecycle of a mission
are important for a shared understanding of the
mandates and a common commitment to their
implementation,recognizingthat such consultations
should not delay the establishment of a mission.
The Security Council emphasizes the importance
of holding inclusive and meaningful consultations
on a regular basis with the Secretariat and troop-
and police-contributing countries at senior levels,
including with specialized personnel, experts and
high-level military officials, as needed, the aim of
which should be to ensure a shared understanding
among the Secretariat and potential contributors on

required capabilities, resulting in commitments to
deliver on the mandate and concept of operations.

"The Security Council invites the Secretariat
to brief potential troop- and police-contributing
countries, as needed, together with Security
Council members, on its assessment of a conflict
and potential mandate options before an operation is
authorized, with aview to allowing the consideration
of capabilities required and giving the Council an
opportunity to obtain insights on the challenges
and opportunities involved in mandating certain
tasks and in generating the required capabilities
under specific time frames. The Security Council
also invites the Secretariat to regularly brief troop-
and police-contributing countries, through existing
mechanisms when appropriate, and emphasizes
the importance of a full exchange of views on
the operational challenges being faced by troop-
and police-contributing countries. The Security
Council welcomes in this regard the establishment
of the Strategic Force Generation and Capability
Planning Cell. The Security Council requests
the Secretariat to regularly brief troop- and
police-contributing countries, together with the
Security Council, and seek their views, including of
their uniformed personnel deployed on the ground,
in assessing progress once the mandate of a peace
operation is established.

"The Security Council recognizes that
the success of peacekeeping operations will
increasingly require strong collaboration between
the United Nations and regional and subregional
organizations from the outset and in this regard
encourages the Secretariat, and expresses its
readiness, as appropriate, to consult with relevant
regional organizations, particularly the African
Union, especially if transitioning from a regional
to a United Nations peacekeeping operation. The
Security Council strongly encouragesthe Secretariat
to consult with troop- and police-contributing
countries in a timely manner when planning any
change in military tasks, mission-specific rules of
engagement, concepts of operations or command-
and-control structure or early peacebuilding that
would have an impact on the personnel, equipment,
training and logistics requirements, so as to
enable troop- and police-contributing countries to
contribute their advice during the planning process
and to ensure that their personnel have the capacity
to meet the new demands. The Security Council
calls on the Secretary-General to ensure that
heads of mission, force commanders and police
commissioners engage early with senior civilian
and military staff of the mission on changes to
a mandate in advance of the issuance of a new
concept of operations and directives, to ensure
unity of understanding of mandate changes and
better mandate implementation across the mission
and to ensure that operational commanders' views
are considered during the process.

"The Security Council takes note ofthe intention
of the Secretary-General to provide briefings to
the Security Council on conduct, discipline and
performance issues that undermine implementation
of the mandate, including failure of troop- and
police-contributing countries to implement the
mandated tasks and on implementation of protection
of civilians' mandates and allegations of sexual
exploitation and abuse as well as the Secretary-
General's intention to inform the Security Council
appropriately and notes the importance of these
issues for triangular consultations. The Security
Council also notes the importance of the issues
of capabilities and performance requirements
for triangular consultations, through a thorough
common understanding of the tasks to be performed
by missions and in that regard calls on the
Secretariat to assist troop- and police-contributing
countries by clarifying these requirements and
welcomes ongoing support by Member States
to troop- and police-contributing countries in
meeting these requirements. The Security Council
encourages troop- and police-contributing
countries to communicate during negotiations in
respect of possible deployment, national caveats
regarding the use of military or police contingents
and emphasizes that these caveats will be taken
into account in the decision-making process when
selecting forces, including whether to proceed with
deployment.

"The Security Council, including through its
Working Group, remains committed to further
discussions to enhance triangular consultations,
particularly its partnership with troop- and
police-contributing countries, and to take forward
the undertakings of this presidential statement.
Recalling its resolution 1353 (2001) and related
presidential statements, the Security Council
expresses its readiness to further develop the
process of informal consultation sessions with
troop- and police-contributing countries on an
ongoing basis and in advance of mandate renewals
and urges troop- and police-contributing countries
to provide their views on this issue by 31 March
2016, including through its Working Group."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2015/26.

I wish members of the Council a happy new year.

The meeting rose at 11.25 am.
