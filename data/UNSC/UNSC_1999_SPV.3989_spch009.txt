Mr. Dejammet (France) (spoke in French): During
the formal meeting held by the Security Council on 24
March 1999, my delegation laid out the reasons for
France's involvement in the actions under way in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

The Security Council adopted resolutions 1160 (1998),
1199 (1998) and 1203 (1998) under Chapter VII of the
United Nations Charter. In resolutions 1199 (1998) and
1203 (1998), the Security Council affirmed that the
deterioration of the situation in Kosovo constituted a threat
to peace and security in the region. In resolution 1199
(1998), the Security Council made a certain number of
demands addressed, in particular, to the Belgrade
authorities.

In its resolution 1203 (1998), the Security Council
endorsed and supported the agreements concluded
between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, on
the one hand, and between the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
on the other. The Security Council demanded the full and
prompt implementation of these agreements by the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. These agreements
involved specific obligations and commitments on the part
of the Yugoslav Government.

These obligations have not been respected by
Belgrade. Meanwhile, tension, confrontation and the threat
of violent repression have increased. The actions decided
upon respond to Belgrade's violation of its international
obligations under the resolutions which the Security
Council has adopted under Chapter VII of the United
Nations Charter.

The draft resolution that was submitted to us runs
directly counter to our judgement. That is why France
voted against it.
