Mr. De La Sabliere (France) (spoke in French):
By adopting resolution 1718 (2006) today, the Security
Council has responded firmly to last Monday's
announcement of a nuclear test by the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea. This firm response voices
universal condemnation of that extremely serious act
and the international community's determination with
respect to the behaviour of Pyongyang.

This resolution, under Chapter VII of the Charter,
sets out a number of strong measures regarding the
military programmes of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, in particular those related to
missiles and weapons of mass destruction. It was
necessary in particular to put an end to the importing
and exporting by the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea of material associated with those programmes. It
was necessary also to ensure the effectiveness of these
measures through cooperation by States, acting in
conformity with international law, in the inspection of
cargo to and from the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea.

Given the challenge posed by North Korea and in
a context in which we must confront other proliferation
crises, it was essential for the international community
to be united and extremely firm. Through its
unanimous decision, the Security Council has clearly
demonstrated that North Korea's conduct will not be
tolerated.

We understand that the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea's full compliance with this
resolution and the successful resumption of the Six-
Party Talks would prompt the Council to act to lift the
measures imposed by the resolution.
