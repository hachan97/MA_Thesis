The President (spoke in French): At the very
outset, on behalf of the entire Security Council, I wish
to convey to the representative of the United States,
Ambassador Jim Cunningham, and to the entire United
States delegation our feelings of distress and deep
solidarity and our condolences on behalf of all
members of the Council.

I now invite members of the Council and all those
present in the Chamber to observe a minute of silence
in memory of all the victims of the terrorist acts that
struck New York and the United States yesterday.

The members of the Security Council observed a
minute ofsilence.

Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.

Threats to international peace and security
caused by terrorist acts

The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them a draft
resolution, contained in document S/2001/86l, which
has been prepared in the course of prior consultations.

Members of the Council who wish to speak are
invited to so inform the Secretariat. I would point out
to the many delegations present that are not members
of the Council that, in the course of consultations, in
view of the fact that the General Assembly will hold a
meeting on the same subject this afternoon at 3 p.m., it
was deemed preferable to limit the list of speakers to
the 15 members of the Council. However, those
delegations wishing to have their planned statements
included in the official records of the Council are urged
to transmit those statements to the Secretariat so that
they might be fully reflected in the official record.

I thank the Secretary-General for his presence
here today and invite him to make his statement.
