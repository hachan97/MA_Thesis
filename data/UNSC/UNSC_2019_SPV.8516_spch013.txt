Mrs. Tshabalala (South Africa): We note that
today's discussion is taking place as requested by
Ukraine in its letter dated 24 April 2019.

At the outset we wish to thank the briefers for their
briefings on the current situation in eastern Ukraine.

It is clear from the briefings and recent
developments that there remains an urgent need for the
immediate cessation of hostilities in eastern Ukraine.
The ongoing tensions and conflict will continue to
exacerbate the humanitarian conditions on the ground.
In that regard, it is important that the parties ensure
that there is an urgent de-escalation of tensions to allow
for a situation that is conducive to the alleviation of the
humanitarian crisis.

In order to make meaningful progress, it remains
necessary that all the parties fully implement all
of their respective commitments under the Minsk
agreements. At this point, the Minsk agreements,
including the package of measures agreed under the
Minsk II agreements, provide the most promising road
map for the peaceful settlement of the hostilities in
eastern Ukraine.

South Africa notes the recent tensions between
the parties. It is of critical importance that the parties
refrain from actions that could escalate tensions
and further destabilize the situation on the ground.
Furthermore, the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe's Special Monitoring Mission
to Ukraine has played a critical role in the region. It
therefore remains important that the Mission continue
its work with unhindered access to monitor and verify
compliance with the Minsk agreements in line with
its mandate. South Africa encourages all the parties
to strengthen all diplomatic efforts to produce an
inclusive, sustainable and peaceful solution based on
cooperation and dialogue.
