The President: May I respectfully remind
everyone present that mobile phones are equipped with
a silent mode. I understand that it is not very easy for
all of us to use that modern technology, but I can assure
everyone that it is not that difficult, and, if they do so,
they will still be in a position to communicate with the
real world outside this Chamber while at the same time
showing respect for their colleagues.

(spoke in Russian)

We have heard the last speaker inscribed on my
list under rule 37.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2003/630, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the
voting.
