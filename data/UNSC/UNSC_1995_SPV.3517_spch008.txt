Mrs. Albright (United States of America): The United
States is deeply concerned about the absence of progress
towards peace in Liberia. The cease-fire begun on
December 28 has largely broken down. There are new
reports of massacres and atrocities against civilians and new
movements of displaced persons towards Buchanan and
across the Ghanaian and Ivoirian borders.

Primary responsibility for the continued bloodshed lies
with the armed factions that have proved unwilling thus far
to implement the Akosombo and Accra Agreements. We
strongly urge that the cease-fire be restored promptly, and
that the factions act quickly to resolve their differences over
the Council of State and to implement the accords.

The United States continues to support fully the efforts
of the Chairman of the Economic Community of West
African States, President Rawlings of Ghana, to bring about
a summit meeting of the concerned States in the region,
together with the faction leaders. This meeting is now
scheduled for 17 May in Abuja, Nigeria. We strongly urge
all invited Heads of State to attend the summit in the
interest of harmonizing their policies on Liberia, and
particularly to halt the flow of arms into Liberia, thereby
facilitating an end to the war.

The United States believes that the United Nations
Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) has a key role to
play in monitoring implementation of the peace process and
protecting civilians from the fighting. Unfortunately, it has
been unable thus far to carry out its mandate because of
continuing hostilities. The United States supports this
limited extension of the UNOMIL mandate in the hope that
the regional summit meeting on 17 May will give real
impetus to peace. We must say, however, that technical
roll-overs are not a solution and that the patience of the
international community is not endless.
