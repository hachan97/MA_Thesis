The President: I thank the representative of
Croatia for delivering the shortest speech of the day; he
spoke for an average of 40 seconds per European Union
country. If everybody could speak for only 40 seconds,
we would be finished before 4 p.m.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Viet Nam.
