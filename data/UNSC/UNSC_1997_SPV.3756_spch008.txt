Mr. Ladsous (France) (interpretation from French):
The French delegation worked with others to find a
consensus solution, so that we could issue a unanimous
decision on a situation which, in everyone's View,
warranted a reaction by the Security Council. It was not
possible to achieve that consensus, which we regret.

We consider that the Security Council ought to be able
to carry out its responsibilities in respect of decisions that
endanger the Middle East peace process and that have
aroused the disapproval of the entire international
community, including the co-sponsors of the process.

France calls upon the parties to the peace process to
persist in the endeavour they have undertaken, and we
urge the Israeli authorities to consider the consequences
for the peace process of each of their decisions.

France solemnly reaffirms previous resolutions, some
of them adopted unanimously, relating to the territories
occupied by Israel since 1967, including Jerusalem. The
settlements run counter to international law, including the
Fourth Geneva Convention. They are also at variance with
the spirit of the peace agreements and constitute a serious
obstacle to the process. This is particularly true when the
settlements are in the Jerusalem area and thus prejudge
the final status of that city.

France is concerned at the resumption of violence.
This violence has been deadly: last week in the Jordan
Valley and today in Tel Aviv. The French Government
has expressed its revulsion and consternation at these
attacks and its sympathy with the families of the victims.
France has also indicated its feelings with respect to the
serious incidents at Jerusalem and at Hebron. We appeal
for reason to prevail over emotion, and for avoidance of
any action, any measure, any statement that could
exacerbate the situation and heighten tension. The logic of
peace and dialogue can prevail and should prevail.
