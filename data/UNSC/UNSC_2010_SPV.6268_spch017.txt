Mr. Salam (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): I would
like first to add my voice to those of my colleagues in
welcoming His Excellency Mr. Saudabayev, and to
thank him for his presence in our midst and for his
important briefing. Allow me to make five observations.

Our meeting today is a model for enhancing the
important relationship between the United Nations and
the regional and subregional organizations, particularly
in light of the objective discussion held in this
Chamber last month emphasizing the aspects of
complementarity between these organizations.
Secondly, we salute the role played by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) in the field of preventive diplomacy and in
containing conflicts and preventing their proliferation,
which adds to the comparative advantage and value of
the regional and subregional organizations. Thirdly, we
welcome the role undertaken by the OSCE in helping
to address various crises, and in particular in
supporting stabilization in Afghanistan and other areas.
Fourthly, we call for dialogue and cooperation between
the OSCE and its regional counterparts and subregional
organizations, on the one hand, and between those
organizations and the United Nations, particularly the
Security Council, on the other.

Fifthly and lastly, I stress the need to improve
such dialogue so that we can not only address the
spread of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism,
but also promote human rights and the rule of law and
enhance dialogue among civilizations and religions, as
we shall at the high-level conference to be held in
Astana, Kazakhstan, on 28 and 29 June. We stress the
need to focus on education and on a framework for
addressing the root causes of crises. In conclusion, I
would like to reaffirm our confidence in the leadership
role of Kazakhstan in all these areas.
