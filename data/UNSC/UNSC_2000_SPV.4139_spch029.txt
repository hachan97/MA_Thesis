Mr. Satoh (Japan): Japan has requested this
opportunity to participate in this meeting because of its
deep concern over the deteriorating situation in Sierra
Leone. My delegation joins the previous speakers in
condemning the violence by the Revolutionary United Front
(RUF), particularly its brutal attacks against unarmed
civilians and United Nations peacekeepers. We demand that
the RUF stop its hostile actions and that it release
unharmed the hundreds of peacekeepers it has taken
hostage.

The danger that the hostilities could escalate once
again into a full-blown civil war is very real. J apan's
concern is further compounded by the fact that the situation
in Sierra Leone could have grave implications for the future
of United Nations peacekeeping operations as a whole, and
particularly for those in Africa.

It is therefore imperative that the international
community respond quickly and effectively. The actions it
takes must be determined by decisions of the Security
Council, as prescribed by the United Nations Charter.

Whether to expand the mandate of the United Nations
Mission in Sierra Leone to include the task of peace
enforcement by incorporating the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group
(ECOMOG) into the United Nations mission, or whether to
entrust peace enforcement to ECOMOG itself, is for the
Council to decide. What is most important is for the
Security Council to respond promptly, before the situation
deteriorates further.

I can assure you, Mr. President, that Japan will
continue to support the decisions of the Security Council
on this issue.
