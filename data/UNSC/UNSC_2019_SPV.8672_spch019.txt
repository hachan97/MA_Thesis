Mr. Pecsteen de Buytswerve (Belgium) (spoke in French): I would like to thank Special Envoy Martin
Griffiths and Assistant Secretary-General Ursula
Mueller for their briefings.

I, too, would like to welcome the signing of
the Riyadh agreement between the Government of
Yemen and the Southern Transitional Council. We
commend Saudi Arabia for its mediation efforts and its
leadership. We hope that this positive momentum can
be maintained during the next stages in the political
process, which must be inclusive, with the meaningful
participation of women and young people, and reflect
the ethnic, geographical, social and political diversity
of the Yemeni population.

We welcome the de-escalation efforts, although the
civilian population is still suffering disproportionately.
We encourage the continuation of those efforts to
achieve a cessation of hostilities throughout the country.

Humanitarian access remains very difficult,
as Ms. Mueller told us. It is essential that all parties
facilitate access for humanitarian assistance and respect
international humanitarian law. In particular, we call
on the parties to lift all restrictions on humanitarian
access and commercial imports. We encourage the
Government of Yemen to suspend the implementation
of Decree 49 until a lasting solution to the oil crisis
is found. We encourage the Houthis to provide access
to the FSO SAFER tanker in order to facilitate an
assessment of the situation and to prevent a potential
environmental disaster.

In parallel, we continue to call on all parties to
fully implement the Stockholm Agreement, including
the Al-Hudaydah Agreement, the agreement on
the exchange of prisoners and the statement of
understanding on Taiz.

Finally, the parties must respect their obligations
and commitments under international humanitarian
law and international human rights law.
