Mr. La Yifan (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
Chinese delegation thanks you, Sir, for convening this
urgent meeting at the request of the delegation of
Libya. We listened carefully to the statements made by
the representatives of Libya and Israel and the observer
of Palestine, whom I wish to thank.

China is deeply concerned about developments
since yesterday surrounding the Libyan ship Al-Marwa.
We regret that the delivery of humanitarian supplies
has once again been blocked. The current humanitarian
situation in Gaza is grave. The population of Gaza is in
urgent need of food, medicine and other emergency
items. In such circumstances, Israel's siege of Gaza
and its obstruction of humanitarian assistance will not
only further exacerbate the plight of the Palestinian
population, but will also poison the atmosphere in
which both sides must conduct political dialogue and
negotiations.

In our view, no issue can be used to justify the
collective punishment of the people of Gaza. As the
occupying Power, Israel is obligated under
international law to respect and guarantee the
satisfaction of the basic humanitarian needs of the
people of Palestine. We again urge Israel to respond to
the appeals of the international community by fully
lifting the siege of Gaza and permitting the delivery of
humanitarian assistance by the United Nations and the
international community.
