The President: After consultations among
members of the Security Council, I have been
authorized to make the following statement on behalf
of the Council:

"The Security Council affirms its
determination to promote increased multilateral
cooperation as an important means of enhancing
States' implementation of resolution 1540 (2004).
"The Security Council recalls its resolution
1540 (2004) of 28 April 2004 and resolution 1673
(2006) of 27 April 2006 and stresses the
importance of compliance with resolution 1540
(2004) through the achievement of the
implementation of its requirements.

"The Security Council acknowledges with
appreciation the activities of international
organizations with expertise in the field of non-
proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons and their means of delivery covered by
resolution 1540 (2004), in particular the
International Atomic Energy Agency and the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons, especially in providing assistance in
the implementation of that resolution, without
altering their mandates and responsibilities.

"The Security Council takes note of the
relevant activities of the World Customs
Organization (WCO) and the relevant
international arrangements. The Security Council
also notes with appreciation the seminars and
workshops that have been held with countries and
regional and subregional organizations in order to
promote experience-sharing and the full
implementation of resolution 1540 (2004).

"The Security Council is mindful of the
need further to explore with international,
regional and subregional organizations
experience-sharing and lessons learned in the
07-24825
areas covered by resolution 1540 (2004), and the
availability of programmes which might facilitate
implementation of the resolution.

"The Security Council reiterates its
determination to enhance its cooperation with
international organizations and to develop
preferred mechanisms for cooperating with those
organizations on a case-by-case basis, reflecting
the variation in each organization's capacity and
mandate, including in assisting States in
providing the Committee with information it still
encourages on the ongoing process of
implementation of resolution 1540 (2004), as set
out in the Committee's report of 25 April 2006, as
well as assisting Member States in their capacity-
building and planning of the process of
implementation of resolution 1540 (2004), in
accordance with provisions of operative
paragraph 7 of resolution 1540 (2004) and
paragraph 5 of resolution 1673 (2006)."

This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2007/4.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 4.50 pm.
