Mr. Kleib (Indonesia): First of all, I would like to
join others in welcoming the Secretary-General and
thanking him for his statement.

After years of hardship, including living under
harsh sanctions, the Iraqi people deserve peace,
stability and progress. My delegation therefore believes
that the Government of Iraq, in cooperation with the
international community, should redouble its efforts to
find a viable solution that will ensure stability and
security in the country.

The current security conditions in Iraq have also
had serious humanitarian consequences. The problem
of Iraqi refugees and internally displaced persons has
become one of the world's largest and fastest-growing,
but least known, humanitarian crises.

While restoring security is a matter of urgency, it
is also critical to address friction based on ethnicity
and religion. Unity is vital to achieving a peaceful Iraq.
We therefore believe that Iraqis must stand shoulder to
shoulder at all levels, put aside all their differences and
work together to respond to the challenges that
continue to confront the country.

Iraq cannot go it alone in embracing
transformation to meet the innumerable challenges
ahead; it needs partnership and support from various
quarters. Therefore, the role and the contributions of
the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq
(UNAMI) are essential in helping the Iraqis to achieve
their goals. My delegation thus supports the extension
of its mandate and the addition of new responsibilities
to its tasks. That is why we voted in favour of
resolution 1770 (2007).
