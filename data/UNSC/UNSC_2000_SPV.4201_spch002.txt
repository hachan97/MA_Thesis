The Secretary-General: I would like to thank
the Security Council for holding this meeting, which is
very timely. Most of all I want to express my deep
appreciation to President Mandela for travelling all the
way to New York to brief the Council on the current
phase of his peace efforts in Burundi. Thanks to
President Mandela's work, the peace process has
moved forward significantly. The signing of the Arusha
agreement on 28 August, followed by the agreement on
20 September in Nairobi on the participation of the
remaining three parties, is surely a very important
milestone in Burundi's long and painful road to peace.

Let me reiterate our gratitude to President
Mandela for the invaluable contribution he has made.
As you know, the Arusha agreement is a
comprehensive blueprint for the reform of Burundian
society. It addresses the root causes of the conflict,
such as exclusion and genocide, as well as the tragic
consequences of the war, including the plight of
hundreds of thousands of refugees and internally
displaced people.

However, before this ambitious programme can
be fully implemented, a number of obstacles must still
be overcome, to which the Facilitator is now dedicating
his time and effort.

The United Nations is ready and willing to make
its contribution to the success of these efforts - for the
sake of the people of Burundi, but also for the stability
and prosperity of a troubled region, which could find a
source of inspiration in a successful peace process in
Burundi for the negotiated settlement of its wider
conflicts.

I am grateful that Madiba is here with us today.
Let us listen to his assessment, and let us give him our
unstinting support.
