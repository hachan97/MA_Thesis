Mr. Rapp: I wish to join President Winter in
thanking the Council for convening this meeting and
you, Sir, for presiding over it. I should also like to
thank Council members for their presentations on
behalf of member States, and particularly for their
commendation of and praise for the work of the
Special Court. I think I speak for the staff of the
Special Court, and in particular the staff of the Office
of the Prosecutor, in saying that those who are working
in this endeavour will continue until our mandate is
complete to work in such a way that we are worthy of
the support that the Security Council has provided.
