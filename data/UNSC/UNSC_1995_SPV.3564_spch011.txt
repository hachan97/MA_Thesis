Mr. Ladsous (France) (interpretation from French):
The operation that the Bosnian Serbs have mounted against
the safe areas of Srebrenica and Zepa is in itself
particularly grave - something that was made clear in
the case of Srebrenica, in resolution 1004 (1995), whose
adoption my delegation helped to secure.

The latest resolution, which the Council has just
adopted, addresses a specific problem stemming from the
Bosnian Serb attacks on those areas. I am referring to the
treatment meted out to the displaced persons from among
the civilian population, as well as to the soldiers who
were taken prisoner in these attacks.

With respect to the displaced persons, we still have
no news concerning thousands of people who were taken
away from Srebrenica and to whom no humanitarian
organization has been able to gain access. Such access
must be granted immediately, and as long as these
civilians, held illegally, have not been released, the forces
detaining them are wholly responsible for their safety.

As to the soldiers taken prisoner, it would appear
that the International Committee of the Red Cross has not
yet been authorized - in violation of humanitarian law
- to visit them or enabled to register them.

This situation, which involves criminal liability for
those responsible for it, must come to an end
immediately. The Council requests the Secretary-General
to report to it before the end of the month concerning
measures taken to end this situation. It is, moreover,
possible that before that date it will have to take action
again on this question, which involves the fate of
thousands of civilians subjected to vile and barbaric
treatment. We owe it to ourselves, where they are
concerned, to remain especially vigilant on this matter.
