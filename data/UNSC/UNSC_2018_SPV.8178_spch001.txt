The President: In accordance with rule 39 of
the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite
Mr. Vladimir Voronkov, Under-Secretary-General,
United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism, to
participate in this meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document 8/2018/80, which contains the sixth report
of the Secretary-General on the threat posed by the
Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) (Da'esh)
to international peace and security and the range of
United Nations efforts in support of Member States in
countering that threat.

I now give the floor to Mr. Voronkov.
