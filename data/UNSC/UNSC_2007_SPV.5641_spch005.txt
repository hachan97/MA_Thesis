The President: I thank Mr. Costa for his briefing.
Before opening the floor, I wish to request all
participants to limit their statements to no more than
five minutes in order to enable the Council to work
efficiently within its timetable. I thank participants for
their understanding and cooperation.

I now give the floor to the representative of Italy.
On behalf of the Security Council, I extend a warm
welcome to His Excellency Mr. Massimo D'Alema,
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign
Affairs of Italy.
