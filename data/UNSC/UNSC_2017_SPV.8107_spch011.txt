Mr. Bermudez Alvarez (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): Uruguay voted in favour of draft
resolution S/2017/970, introduced by Japan for the
following reasons.
First, the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative
Mechanism (JIM) was established by resolution 2235
(2015). It is our Mechanism.

Secondly, if the JIM. were allowed to pursue its
work on the use of chemical weapons on a regular
basis, it would identify those responsible for the use
of those banned weapons, which constitutes atrocious
crimes directed against innocent civilians. The JIM. is
crucial for combating impunity.

Thirdly, based on my second point, the work of the
JIM. could be a deterrent to the use of those weapons in
other conflicts.

Fourthly, in such a long-standing and complex
conflict as that in Syria, whose political and
humanitarian dimensions we assess every week in the
Security Council, along with the chemical weapons
dossier, it is best to have a dedicated mechanism like
the JIM. to address it.

Fifthly, as we said yesterday (see S/PV.8105),
it is paradoxical that the Security Council, which
established the JIM. in the first place, has decided to
sign its death warrant.

In conclusion, we call once again for an end to
the current polarization and impasse in the Security
Council, and for the time necessary to be set aside to
save the Mechanism. To that end, we echo the request
made by the representative of Sweden.
