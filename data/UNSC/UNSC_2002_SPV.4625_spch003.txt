The President (spoke in French): I wish to
inform members of the Council that I intend to suspend
the meeting at 1 p.m. and to resume punctually at
3 p.m. I also wish to point out that at this meeting the
Council will first hear from non-members of the
Council.

The first speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of South Africa. I invite him to take a
seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
