The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Austria, Chad, Egypt, Norway and
the Sudan in which they request to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, the
representatives of the aforementioned countries
took the seats reservedfor them at the side of the
Council Chamber.

The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2006/433, which contains the report of the
Security Council mission to the Sudan and Chad, from
4 to 10 June 2006.

I now give the floor to the representative of the
United Kingdom, His Excellency Sir Emyr Jones Parry,
in his capacity as head of the Security Council mission
to the Sudan and Chad.
