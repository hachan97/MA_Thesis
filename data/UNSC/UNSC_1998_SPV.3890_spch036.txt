The President: I thank the representative of Ukraine
for the kind words he addressed to me.

As I stated previously after the intervention of the
Ambassador of Canada, States members of the Security
Council certainly have taken note of the remarks made by
other Member States.

The next speaker on my list is the representative of
Argentina. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table
and to make his statement.
