Mr. Bessho (Japan): Japan welcomes the unanimous
adoption of resolution 2337 (2017). Japan strongly
condemns the refusal by Mr. Jammeh to transfer power
to President Barrow, against the will of the Gambian

people, which was demonstrated in the presidential
election last December. Japan highly commends the
strenuous mediation efforts undertaken by subregional
and regional actors, including the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African
Union to bring about a peaceful and smooth transition
of power to avoid a crisis.

By unanimously adopting resolution 2337 (2017)
today, the Security Council is sending a clear message
to Mr. Jammeh to carry out a peaceful and orderly
transition of power to President Barrow. He should
do so immediately. The Council should work together
with ECOWAS and the African Union to prevent any
aggravation of the situation.
