The President: I believe we have had an
extremely interesting debate on East Timor today at an
important moment in its transition to independence. I
am particularly pleased that Special Representative
Vieira de Mello and Mr. Alkatiri, as well as Ms. Borges
and Mr. de Araujo, were here to hear in person the
strong messages of support for the continued
involvement of the United Nations in that process. As
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ireland, a country with
close links with East Timor, I feel privileged to have
presided over such a positive meeting at the
culmination of weeks of discussions and to deliver the
presidential statement in the next meeting.

May I say also how appreciative I am to hear the
compliments and the kind words that were directed to
Ireland, to our delegation here, to our Permanent
Representative, Richard Ryan, and to his staff for the
way they have presided over the Security Council
proceedings during the course of this month. We, too,
are very proud of them. They have excelled themselves
and have kept to the finest traditions of our public
service. We are very grateful for the outstanding work
that they have done during this month and, indeed,
throughout our membership of this body. We look
forward to continuing with that work, working with our
colleagues to deal with the issues of the day.

I am sure that we all appreciate the strong
commitment of the Secretary-General to East Timor
also, as has been continuously demonstrated, and the
great support that there is for his report. We look
forward to his ongoing personal involvement as a
major factor in the success of this undertaking.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 5.55 pm.
