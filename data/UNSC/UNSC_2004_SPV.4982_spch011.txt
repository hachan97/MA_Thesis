Mr. Motoc (Romania): I also heartily welcome
the presence today in the Security Council of the Iraqi
Minister for Foreign Affairs, His Excellency Mr.
Hoshyar Zebari. It is indeed the first opportunity, after
the formation of the interim Government of Iraq, for
the members of the Council to hear the views and the
expectations of that Government about how the
Council can best assist Iraqis transform their
aspirations into realities.

I wish to take this opportunity to recognize the
presence earlier of the Secretary-General.

The United Nations is also to be credited for
having come as far as it has, listening today to such a
forward-looking, self-confident vision statement by a
proud representative of the new Iraq.

The Brahimi and Perelli missions have already
produced a valuable outcome. My Government
welcomed the formation of the interim Government on
1 June as an important step toward the transfer of full
sovereignty to Iraq on 30 June. It was also the view
that, with the interim Government in place, the political
process in Iraq has entered a new and important stage.
It is our sincere hope that the interim Government will
be able to solidify thinking, keep the aspirations of the
Iraqi people united and have a bold start in managing
the most complex task ahead - the proper
implementation of the political calendar in organizing
free and fair elections in Iraq.

As far as we in the Security Council are
concerned, I would like to restate once more Romania's
resolve to promote the adoption of a new resolution on
Iraq that best assists the daunting transformation
processes in that country. Minister Zebari's comments
earlier seem to indicate that we are on the right track. I
wish to reassure Foreign Minister Zebari of Romania's
firm commitment to continue to support the transitional
processes under way in Iraq, in particular the
stabilization efforts carried out by the multinational
force and the institutional and economic reconstruction
of the country.
