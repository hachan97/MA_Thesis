The President: I thank the representative of
Lebanon for the kind words he addressed to me and to
my predecessor.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
Chairman of the Committee on the Exercise of the
Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People. I invite him
to take a seat at the Council table and to make his
statement.
