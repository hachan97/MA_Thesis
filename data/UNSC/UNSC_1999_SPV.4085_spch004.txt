Mr. Buallay (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): The
question of East Timor has proved to what extent success
can be found in reaching a solution to a problem, however
large, with the cooperation of the parties concerned and the
assistance of the United Nations.

It is certainly true that this large operation would not
have succeeded without the genuine will shown by
Indonesia to reach a solution, a will later translated into
recommitment to the agreements it has entered into. We
should also like to pay tribute to Portugal for the efforts it
made in the process.

Rebuilding East Timor economically and
administratively is of utmost importance. Such rebuilding
cannot be separated, under any circumstances, from national
reconciliation and the building of good relations between
East Timor and its neighbours, in particular with Indonesia.
Such a relationship must be based on cooperation and on
setting the past aside and looking to the future.

Among the tasks to be undertaken by the United
Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor is the
increasing and coordinating of assistance to displaced
persons and returnees. In this regard, greater support
should be provided by donor countries, and we are
pleased to note the positive results of the pledging
conference held recently in Tokyo. Financial pledges
made at that conference will help the United Nations in
its work in East Timor.
We would also like to express our satisfaction at the
means used to ensure the safe return of refugees to their
homes in East Timor. In this regard, we would like to
convey our gratitude and appreciation to the United
Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor, under
the leadership of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special
Representative of the Secretary-General for East Timor,
for its efforts. We wish it every success in transforming
the International Force, East Timor (INTERFET), from a
multinational force to a United Nations peacekeeping
operation.
