Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China endorses the extension of the mandate of the
European Union-led peacekeeping force (EUFOR) and
welcomes the continuing positive role that EUFOR
plays in maintaining peace and stability in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. We voted in favour of today's resolution
2183 (2014). Meanwhile, I would like to point out that
China respects the sovereignty, independence, unity
and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We
believe that the path for development and diplomatic
policies should be decided by its Government and
people. We also believe that during the consultations
on the resolution, the Security Council should have
thoroughly considered the opinions of all sides and paid
sufficient attention to the concerns of its members, so as
to achieve the greatest possible consensus and broadest
possible support for it.
