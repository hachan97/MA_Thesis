The President: I thank the representative of Algeria
for his kind words addressed to me.

At this point, I should like to inform the Council that
I have received letters from the representatives of
Colombia and Guatemala in which they request to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice,
I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional
rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

 

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Ocaziones
(Colombia) and Mr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) took the
seats reserved for them at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The President: The next speaker inscribed on my list
is the representative of South Africa. I invite him to take a
seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
