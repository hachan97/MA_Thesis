Mr. Mahugu (Kenya): Let me at the outset pay
tribute to Mr. Gerd Merrem, the Secretary-General's
Special Representative, for his outstanding work and
leadership, and to the men and women serving with the
United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan
(UNMOT) for the manner in which they have performed
their duties under difficult and often dangerous conditions.

My delegation finds the Secretary-General's latest
report on Tajikistan encouraging. The ceasefire holds. There
is concrete progress in the implementation of the General
Agreement on political, legal and military issues. There are
also solid steps forward in the rehabilitation effort, and the
donor pledging conference scheduled to be held at Vienna
in the next 11 days should generate resources for the
critical post-conflict peace-building phase that my
delegation has always viewed as critical in these situations.

We also strongly believe that the Commission on
National Reconciliation is very important, and we commend
its efforts and encourage it to continue with its good work.

The security situation, however, is still unsettled. We
believe that the joint security unit will help. We hope that
those elements in Tajikistan intent on using violence as a
means of resolving their differences will reject that
approach and work with other parties in rebuilding a
peaceful Tajikistan. This is the only way in which a
democratic, peaceful, economically viable Tajikistan can be
built. UNMOT's critical role in ensuring the
implementation of the General Agreement is commendable.
Finally, my delegation supports the Secretary-
General's recommendation to expand UNMOT from 45 to
120 military observers and, in this regard, will support the
draft resolution before us. We are happy to note that despite
this expansion the cost is actually slightly less than the
estimates previously proposed.
