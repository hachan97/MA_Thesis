Mr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): Peru
voted in favour of the draft resolution on the situation in
Venezuela (8/2019/ 186) in order to enable the Security
Council, in exercise of the mandate bestowed upon it by
the Charter of the United Nations, to adopt a decision
that contributes to regional peace and security, as
desired by the international community.

We deeply regret the lack of unity within the Council
to help address the situation in Venezuela - which
represents an unprecedented threat to the peace, security,
freedom and prosperity of the entire region - and to
prevent a further escalation of violence and address
the terrible humanitarian crisis causing the country to
suffer. It is even more incomprehensible given that this
was a minimum text that, for the sake of consensus,
had avoided mentioning relevant aspects such as the
constant Violations of human rights and fundamental
freedoms; the terrible humanitarian situation faced
by the population, especially those who are most
vulnerable; the breakdown of democratic order;
endemic corruption and economic collapse; and the
exodus of more than 3.4 million Venezuelans fleeing
this awful reality.

However, we are encouraged to note that the
majority of Council members have reaffirmed their
commitment, to and solidarity with, the brotherly
people of Venezuela, as well as their full willingness to
continue promoting the restoration of democracy in that
country This aspiration will be possible only through
the timely holding of free, fair and credible elections
that are open to the participation of all political parties,
with international backing and observation, thereby
guaranteeing the right of all Venezuelans to live in
democracy and freedom.
