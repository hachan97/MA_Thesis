The President: The Security Council will now
continue its consideration of the item on its agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the situation in
Abkhazia, Georgia, document S/2004/570.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2004/600, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations. I should also like to draw
members' attention to document S/2004/595, which
contains the text of a letter dated 26 July 2004 from
Georgia.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution, as orally
revised in its provisional form in the course of prior
consultations, before it. If I hear no objection, I shall
now put the draft resolution to the vote.
