The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank the
Secretary-General for participating in this meeting
and for his statement. I reiterate our full appreciation
of his skilled leadership of the Organization and his
efforts in the service of its objectives and of furthering
the principles on which it is based. We wish him every
success.

I now give the floor to Mr. Momen.
