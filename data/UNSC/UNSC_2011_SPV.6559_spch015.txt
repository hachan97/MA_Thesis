Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): At the outset, we would like to congratulate
former President Mbeki and Mr. Menkerios for their
important success in today's signing of the agreement
aimed at settling the conflict in the Abyei Area. We
welcome the desire for compromise shown on this

matter by both Khartoum and Juba. We would like to
hope that the signing of the agreement will create
positive political momentum that makes it possible to
address other issues as well in the context of
implementing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement
and of the forthcoming independence of Southern
Sudan.

In the current situation, we call on both parties to
refrain from violence and to do their utmost to address
the humanitarian situation.

The Russian Federation continues to support the
activities of the United Nations presence in the Sudan,
in terms of the work of both Mr. Mbeki and
Mr. Menkerios.
