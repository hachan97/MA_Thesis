Mr. Delattre (France) (spoke in French): The
draft resolution submitted by Russia (S/2018/355)
has just been categorically rejected. The result of the
voting sends a clear message that the members of the
Council understand the circumstances, reason for
and objectives of the military action taken yesterday.
The Council understands why such action, which has
been acknowledged as proportional and targeted, was
required. No one has refuted the fact that the use of
chemical weapons cannot be tolerated and must be
deterred. That is the key point.

It is important that we now look towards the future.
As I have just said, the air strikes were necessary and
served to uphold international law and our political
strategy to end the tragic situation in Syria. It is for
that reason that, together with our American and
British partners, France will work with all members
of the Security Council to submit a draft resolution
on the political, chemical and humanitarian aspects of
the Syrian conflict with a view to devising a lasting
political solution to the conflict.
