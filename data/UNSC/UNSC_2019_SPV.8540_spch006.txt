Mr. Adorn (Cote d'Ivoire) (spoke in French):
Cote d'Ivoire welcomes the unanimous adoption of
resolution 2473 (2019), extending for a further 12
months the authorization to Member States to engage
in inspections on the high seas of vessels heading to
and leaving Libya, with a view to enforcing the strict
enforcement of the arms embargo.

The adoption of the resolution comes at the right
time, given the alarming and ongoing deterioration of
the security and humanitarian situation since 4 April,
which has been fuelled in particular by numerous
violations of the arms embargo. Respect for the arms
embargo undoubtedly represents valuable leverage
for ongoing efforts to achieve the ceasefire so long
sought by the international community and the Libyan
people. That critical ceasefire is in itself an essential
precondition for the resumption of negotiations and the
political process necessary to overcome the crisis. In
that regard, Cete d'lvoire welcomes the commitment
of Special Representative of the Secretary-General
Ghassan Salame' and reiterates its full support for him.

As I have said, respect for the arms embargo
provides critical support for the ongoing efforts. While
my country welcomes the adoption of resolution 2473
(2019), it remains concerned by the inadequate naval
resources available to the European Union military
operation in the Southern Central Mediterranean
(EUNAVFOR MED operation SOPHIA), which limits it
to aerial surveillance, allowing only partial monitoring
of vessels off the Libyan coast.

I would therefore conclude my statement by
calling on the contributing countries to provide, on
an immediate basis, fully operational equipment
appropriate to the functions of operation SOPHIA,
with a view to improving its effectiveness. That would
help to break the vicious circle that is prolonging the
conflict and its consequent atrocities in Libya.
