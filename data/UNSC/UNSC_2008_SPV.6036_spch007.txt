Mr. Quarrey (United Kingdom): First of all, I
would like to thank Ambassador Grauls for this year's
final report to the Council and, on behalf of my
delegation, join others in paying tribute to his
outstanding chairmanship of the 1737 Committee.

The United Kingdom remains committed to the
E3 + 3 Governments dual-track policy. The generous
offer made by this group in June 2008 still stands. It is
deeply disappointing that we have not had a clear
response to date from Iran.

The United Kingdom stands ready to build a
positive relationship with Iran across a range of issues,
but we must first see serious action by Iran to work
with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
and to comply with its Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons responsibilities.

The IAEA Director-General's November report
stated that the agency had received no cooperation
from Iran in the previous two months and that Iran's
uranium enrichment programme continued. Iran's
continued failure to cooperate with the IAEA, or to
08-63944
answer its questions, only increases our concerns about
Iran's nuclear programme and its intentions.

It is vital that Iran urgently and comprehensively
provide the IAEA with all the requested information,
documentation and access. We share the IAEA's
continued concern about outstanding issues relating to
the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear
programmes.

If Iran remains determined to isolate itself, then
we in the international community must remain equally
determined to stand together both in maintaining
pressure on Iran to meet its international obligations
and in making clear to Iran that its choices will have a
cost.

In that context, I would like to highlight the
important measures recently taken by the European
Union as referred to previously by my French
colleague.
