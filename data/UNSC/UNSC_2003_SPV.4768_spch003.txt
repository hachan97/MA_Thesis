The President (spoke in Russian): I thank
Mr. Blix for his comprehensive briefing. Taking note of
the intention of Mr. Blix to retire from his post at the
end of June, I wish, on behalf of the members of the
Council, to express our sincere gratitude to Mr. Blix for
his service, as well as our appreciation for the efforts
made by him and his team to implement the mandate of
the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) in accordance
with the Security Council's resolutions. The members
of the Council also pay tribute to Mr. Blix for his
leadership and for the dedicated and professional
manner in which he has guided the work of UNMOVIC
in pursuit of the disarmament of Iraq.

In accordance with the understanding reached in
the Council's prior consultations, I should now like to
invite Council members to informal consultations to
continue our discussion of this subject.

The meeting rose at I] am.
