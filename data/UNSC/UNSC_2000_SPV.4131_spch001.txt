The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them two letters
from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of
the Security Council, dated 6 and 17 April 2000,
respectively, and contained in documents 8/2000/294 and
S/2000/322.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to document S/2000/295, letter dated 6 April
2000 from the Permanent Representative of Lebanon to the
United Nations transmitting a letter of the same date from
the President of the Lebanese Republic addressed to the
Secretary-General.

Following consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council welcomes the letters of
the Secretary-General to its President of 6 April
(8/2000/294) and 17 April 2000 (8/2000/322), which
includes notification of the decision of the
Government of Israel, as stated in its letter of 17 April
2000 from the Foreign Minister of Israel to the
Secretary-General, to withdraw its forces present in
Lebanon in full accordance with resolutions 425
(1978) and 426 (1978) of 19 March 1978 and its
intention to cooperate fully with the United Nations
in the implementation of its decision.

"The Security Council endorses the decision of
the Secretary-General to initiate preparations to
enable the United Nations to carry out its
responsibilities under resolutions 425 (1978) and 426
(1978), as described in his letter of 17 April 2000.

"The Security Council shares the view
expressed by the Secretary-General in his letter of 6
April 2000 that cooperation by all parties concerned
will be required in order to avoid a deterioration of
the situation. It welcomes his decision to send his
Special Envoy to the region as soon as practicable
and encourages all parties to cooperate fully in the
complete implementation of resolutions 425 (1978)
and 426 (1978).

"The Security Council looks forward to the
Secretary-General reporting back as soon as possible
on relevant developments, including the outcome of
the consultations with the parties and all interested
Member States and those contributing troops to the
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL),
and his conclusions and recommendations regarding
the plans and requirements for implementation of
resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978) and all other
relevant resolutions.

"The Security Council stresses the importance
of, and the need for, achieving a comprehensive, just
and lasting peace in the Middle East, based on all
relevant Security Council resolutions, including
resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2000/ 13.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 10.40 am.
