Mr. Safronkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): My apologies for interrupting. I wanted to ask
my colleague and friend from Japan to take his bottle
of wine off the Security Council table, if he would. I
would again like to remind everyone that this table is
a sacred piece of furniture that should be treated with
respect. As a matter of principle, we should not place
glasses and bottles of wine on it.
