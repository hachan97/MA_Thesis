Mr. Nitzan (Israel): Based on the remarks made
earlier today, it would seem that the High Commissioner
for Human Rights has a mistaken understanding of the
situation in Israel. Her criticism ignored simple facts
on the ground.

Only yesterday, Hamas declared that it would not
be a party to operations at the Rafah border, which is
a major crossing point for people and goods to travel
between Egypt and Gaza. In contrast, Kerem Shalom,
the Israeli crossing into Gaza, has remained open and
is handling increased quantities of goods, including
humanitarian assistance.

To be clear, there is no humanitarian crisis in the
Gaza Strip and no shortage of basic goods.

While I have the floor, I would also like to take
this opportunity to respond to comments made by
certain delegations that are attempting to trample on
the democratic process in the United Nations in the
same way that they trample upon the freedoms of their
own peoples.

In particular, it comes as quite a surprise that the
Syrian representative has the nerve to lecture us on
protecting civilians. Having killed more than 100,000
of their own people, with the assistance of Iran and
Hizbullah, it would seem that the Syrians and the
Iranians are intent on being known not only for creating
a humanitarian crisis but also for filling these halls
with lies and misinformation.
