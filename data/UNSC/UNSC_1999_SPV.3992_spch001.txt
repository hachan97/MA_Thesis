The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them document
S/1999/378, which contains the text of a letter dated 5 April
1999 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President
of the Security Council.

Members of the Council have received photocopies of
a letter dated 8 April 1999 from the Permanent
Representative of Tunisia to the United Nations addressed
to the President of the Security Council, which will be
issued as document S/1999/397.

Following consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council recalls its resolutions 731
(1992) of 21 January 1992, 748 (1992) of 31 March
1992, 883 (1993) of 11 November 1993 and 1192
(1998) of 27 August 1998.

"The Security Council welcomes the letter of the
Secretary-General to the President of the Security
Council of 5 April 1999 (S/1999/378) reporting that
the two persons accused of the bombing of Pan Am
flight 103 have arrived in the Netherlands for the
purpose of trial before the court described in
paragraph 2 of resolution 1192 (1998) and that, with
regard to the bombing of UTA 772, the French
authorities had informed the Secretary-General that he
might indicate, in reporting to the Council under
paragraph 8 of Security Council resolution 1192
(1992), that the conditions set forth in resolution
1192 (1998) had been met, without prejudice to the
other requests concerning the bombing of Pan Am
flight 103.

"The Security Council expresses its deep
appreciation to the Secretary-General, the
Governments of the Republic of South Africa and
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other countries for
their commitment towards reaching a satisfactory
conclusion relating to Pan Am flight 103.

"The Security Council further notes the role
played by the League of Arab States, the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, the
Organization of African Unity and the Non-Aligned
Movement in this regard.

"The Security Council notes that, with the letter
of the Secretary-General of 5 April 1999, the
conditions set forth in paragraph 8 of resolution
1192 (1998) for the immediate suspension of the
measures set forth in resolutions 748 (1992) and 883
(1993) have been fulfilled. In this regard, the
Council recalls that, in accordance with resolution
1192 (1998), the measures set forth in resolutions
748 (1992) and 883 (1993) were immediately
suspended upon receipt of the letter of the Secretary-
General on 5 April 1999 at 14.00 Eastern Standard
Time. This development was immediately
acknowledged through a statement of the President
of the Security Council to the press on 5 April 1999
following consultations of the whole (Press release SC/6662).

"The Security Council remains seized of the
matter."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/ 1999/ 10.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 1.25 p.m.
