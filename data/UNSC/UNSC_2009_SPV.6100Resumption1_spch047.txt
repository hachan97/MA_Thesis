Mr. Weissbrod (Israel): I will not take much of
the Council's time, but will only make a short remark
on the speeches of the representatives of Syria and
Iran. It is astonishing that countries that continue to
actively support terror, sabotage the peace process and
encourage suicide bombings and that continue to
smuggle arms to the region - Lebanon and Gaza - in
these very days and these very moments are lecturing
us about the peace process, moral values and human
rights records. I suggest to those countries and to some
other Member States that spoke to dig into their own
human rights records before speaking about others. In
Israel, we are proud of the sense of self-criticism that
we have as a society and as a State. We hope that
countries like Syria and Iran, and some other Member
States that spoke, will have a bit of that sense of self-
criticism.
