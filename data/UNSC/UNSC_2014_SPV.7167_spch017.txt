Mr. Gasana (Rwanda): I also thank Mr. Jeffrey
Feltman, Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs,
for his briefing.

The situation in Ukraine has further deteriorated
in the past few hours. Ukrainian forces have launched
operations against the separatist militants in the
eastern part of the city of Sloviansk. The rebels have
continued to seize public building in cities in eastern
Ukraine, mainly in Sloviansk and Donetsk, where the
Prosecutor's office is even occupied by the militants.
They even shot down two Ukrainian helicopters on
Friday, killing two crew members. In the meantime,
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) military observers are still being
illegally detained by separatist militants. We are of
course deeply concerned by all those developments,
which further deteriorate the already delicate situation
in eastern Ukraine. We strongly condemn the violent
methods used by armed separatists and we call for a
proportionate response by the Ukrainian forces.

However, we should put our full support behind the
good offices of the Secretary-General in resolving the
crisis in Ukraine. We are happy to hear that Mr. Jeffrey
Feltman is going to Ukraine and Moscow. I call upon
all Council members to trust him, to trust his envoys
and to give them the means and the political backing
necessary to conduct a meaningful mediation in
Ukraine and the region.

The strongest condemnation of Rwanda or of any
other Council member on the deterioration of the crisis
will not solve the Ukrainian conflict. We all know that
only a genuine dialogue by the Ukrainian parties, on
the basis of the 17 April Geneva outcome, and a strong
commitment on the part of of those who have influence
on them, who need to ensure that the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of Ukraine are preserved,
can solve this crisis. Otherwise, the situation will
further escalate, the conflict will become regional, or
worse, and it would be useless to continue to convene
emergency public briefings of the Security Council if
the concerned parties and countries are not willing to
be responsible and solve the conflict. In that regard, we
need to scale down the rhetoric.
