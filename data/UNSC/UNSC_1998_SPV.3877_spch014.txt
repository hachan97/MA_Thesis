Mr. Karev (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian): The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda
is an important element of the general process of achieving
national reconciliation in that country. In support of efforts
to enhance its effectiveness, we welcome the request of the
President of the Tribunal to create a third Trial Chamber
in order to accelerate the trial process.

We also believe that, if the Tribunal is to function
effectively, further measures will have to be taken to
improve its procedures and methods of work and to
rectify the situation with regard to the lack of
administrative and technical personnel and the
construction of additional facilities for the Tribunal. Such
a comprehensive approach will help to overcome those
obstacles that continue to prevent the Tribunal from
promptly and fully fulfilling the tasks that have been
entrusted to it.

In supporting the draft resolution, we believe that the
reference made in it to Chapter VII of the Charter of the
United Nations is a purely technical one and will not set
a precedent for the Security Council's consideration of
similar situations.
