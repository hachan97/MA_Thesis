Mr. Li Yongsheng (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China takes note of the briefing provided by
Prosecutor Bensouda.

The overall situation in the Darfur region of
the Sudan has been stable this year. The Sudanese
Government has been actively dedicated to promoting
the political process in Darfur and established a
Government of National Reconciliation. It also enhanced
the capacity-building of security and governance, as
well as achieved some progress in the maintenance
of stability and the advancement of reconstruction in
Darfur. China welcomes such developments.

Meanwhile, Darfur is still facing various challenges
in its quest for long-term security and stability, including
those posed by armed groups. In lending support to the
Sudanese Government to resolve the existing problems,
the international community should fully respect the
leadership of the Government, adopt an objective and
impartial position and enhance communication and
coordination with the Government.

China hopes that parties in Darfur will continue
to resolve their differences through peaceful means,
including through dialogue and consultations. China
urges the relevant opposition parties and armed groups
in the Sudan to join the political dialogue process at
the earliest date. China supports the African Union
and other regional and subregional organizations in
continuing their mediation efforts.

China's position on the handling of the situation in
the Sudan by the International Criminal Court remains
unchanged. China believes that the international
community should fully respect the judicial
sovereignty of the Sudan and give sufficient attention
to the legitimate concerns of the African Union and the
Sudanese Government on the handling of the situation
in the Sudan.
