Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): First of all, I would like to thank the
representatives of the United Nations Secretariat for their
briefings. I think that their briefings compellingly testify
to the fact that despite the continuing problems - and
there are many caused by the most recent military
escapade undertaken by Georgia against South Ossetia -
the situation is gradually normalizing, and there is more
and more active involvement in this process by
international humanitarian organizations.

Incidentally, the conflict zone has already been
visited by quite a number of leaders of international
humanitarian organizations, and virtually all of them
are giving a high assessment of the role of the Russian
Federation in remedying the humanitarian
consequences of what occurred as a result of the
Georgian aggression against South Ossetia.

Now, I would like to thank the Permanent
Representative of Georgia for having put forward the
initiative of holding today's meeting since it is
providing me with an opportunity to read out here, in
this Chamber, to the members of the Security Council,
this statement, and since the Permanent Representative
of Georgia asked for this meeting to be open and
public, to in fact read to all members of the
international community the following two decrees of
the President of the Russian Federation, signed on
26 August of this year.

"Decree on the recognition of the Republic of
Abkhazia:

"First, in the light of the expression of the free
will of the Abkhaz people to recognize the
Republic of Abkhazia as a sovereign and
independent State;

"Second, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the
Russian Federation is to hold negotiations with
the Abkhaz side on the establishment of
diplomatic relations and on the agreement to
prepare the appropriate documents;

"Third, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the
Russian Federation is authorized to hold, with the
participation of interested federal bodies and
executive authorities, negotiations with the
Abkhaz side on the preparation of a draft treaty
on friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance,
and to submit those documents in the proper
order for signature;
"Fourth, in connection with the appeal of the
President of the Republic of Abkhazia to the
Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation to
ensure, before the conclusion of the treaty in
paragraph three of this decree, the implementation
by the armed forces of the Russian Federation of
peacekeeping functions on the territory of the
Republic of Abkhazia."

The second decree reads as follows:

"Decree on the recognition of the Republic of
South Ossetia:

"First, in the light of the expression of the free
will of the South Ossetian people to recognize the
Republic of South Ossetia as a sovereign and
independent State;

"Second, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the
Russian Federation is to hold negotiations with
the South Ossetian side on the establishment of
diplomatic relations and on the agreement to
prepare the appropriate documents;

"Third, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the
Russian Federation is authorized to hold, with the
participation of interested federal bodies and
executive authorities, negotiations with the South
Ossetia side on the preparation of a draft treaty
on friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance,
and to submit those documents in the proper
order for signature;

"Fourth, in connection with the appeal of the
President of the Republic of South Ossetia to the
Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation to
ensure, before the conclusion of the treaty in
paragraph three of this decree, the implementation
by the armed forces of the Russian Federation of
peacekeeping functions on the territory of the
Republic of South Ossetia."

That is the content of these two decrees signed by
President Medvedev on 26 August of this year.

Today's meeting of the Security Council cannot
be fully valid without the participation of the
representatives of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
Without an understanding of the aspirations of the
peoples ofAbkhazia and South Ossetia, it is impossible
to have an objective picture of what is taking place. We
are convinced that the day will soon come when
members of the Security Council will be able to hear
their positions.

Russia has recognized the independence of South
Ossetia and Abkhazia, aware of its responsibility for
ensuring the survival of their brotherly peoples in the
face of the aggressive and chauvinistic policy of
Tbilisi. The basis of that policy was the motto
proclaimed in 1989 by the then-President of Georgia,
