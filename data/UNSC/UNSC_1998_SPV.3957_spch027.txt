Mr. Dahlgren (Sweden): Allow me also to thank all
my colleagues around the table for their kind words
addressed to me.

I would like to comment on the two questions that
were posed by the representatives of Japan and the United
States on the proposal for joint border surveillance
between Sierra Leone and Liberia and possible assistance
in that endeavour by the United Nations. This proposal,
as I understand it, still has to be elaborated by the two
countries. It is my understanding that only this week the
Vice-President of Sierra Leone was in Monrovia and
spoke to President Taylor and gave him the positive reply
from President Kabbah, and I take it that there will be an
intensive consultation between those two countries. I
would suggest that the Secretariat, through the very able
representatives that the Secretary-General has in both
 

Freetown and Monrovia, follow up on these discussions as
quickly as possible in order to obtain more details.

There are two parts to this, I suppose. The first part
may be less difficult. Technical assistance could be
envisaged to support these common border patrols. The
second part relates to the positioning of United Nations
observers themselves in the border zone. As I said,
necessary security assurances must be obtained, and it
would be supposed, I would assume, that the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring
Group (ECOMOG) or the Government of Sierra Leone had
established control over the border areas on the ground.
That is not the case today, and until we have that situation,
there is not enough security.
