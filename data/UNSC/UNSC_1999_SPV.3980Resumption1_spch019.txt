Sir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): The
representative of Iraq made certain allegations in his
statement concerning the action taken by United States and
United Kingdom forces on 16 December 1998 and
concerning the legality of the no-fly zones. Let me make a
brief further statement.

With regard to the action which began on 16
December, I draw the Council's attention to the statement
I made during the debate on that date. The position on the
no-fly zones, which the representative of Iraq characterized
as illegal, is that they were established to help protect the
civilian population in the north and south from repression
by the Government of Iraq, in support of Security Council
resolution 688 (1991). That repression has been amply
detailed in repeated reports by the Special Rapporteur of
the Commission on Human Rights, most recently in his
September 1998 report, document A/53/433. The no-fly
zones are justified under international law by this
continuing situation of overwhelming humanitarian

 

necessity, which has been caused solely by the Iraqi
regime.

This is not the time to go into detail on the Iraqi
Government's continuing repression of its own
population, but when fully told, that story will be a
horrific one. Any actions taken by my Government in the
no-fly zones are taken purely in self-defence and as a
direct result of Iraqi threats and attacks.
