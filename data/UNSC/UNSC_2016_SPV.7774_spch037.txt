The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of
Turkey, in which he requests to be invited to participate
in the consideration of the item on the Council's agenda.
In conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with
the consent of the Council, to invite the representative
of Turkey to participate in the consideration of the
item, without the right to vote, in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
I call on the representative of Turkey.
