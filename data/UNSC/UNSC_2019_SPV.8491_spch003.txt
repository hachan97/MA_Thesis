The President (spoke in French): I especially thank
Mr. Djinnit for his briefing because, as he mentioned,
this will be his last one before the Security Council in
his current capacity. Allow me, on behalf of everyone,
to express our gratitude for his outstanding work and
exemplary commitment and to wish him every success
in his professional future.

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements.
