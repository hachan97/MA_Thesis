The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received letters from the representatives of
Georgia and Germany, in which they request to be invited
to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's

with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion, without the

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Irakli
