Mr. Annabi: I will be very brief. Ijust wanted to
respond to an important issue raised by Ambassador
Thomson of the United Kingdom and to say that we
fully agree that proposed bilateral assistance for the
Timor-Leste police should be coordinated with
multilateral assistance now and that that coordination
should not be delayed.

We based our estimate of the residual requirement
of the Timor-Leste police on the information that was
available to us at the time we prepared the report. We
would therefore very much welcome any further
information that bilateral partners might be willing to
share on specific plans that they have developed for
assistance to the Timor-Leste police and, more
important, on the timetable for the deployment of their
proposed assistance to the Timorese police. We will
then be able to adjust our own estimates to reflect the
offers of bilateral assistance in our end-of-April report,
but we believe that adjustments should ultimately be
made not only on the basis of anticipated assistance but
on the basis of the assistance that will be effectively
available on the ground in East Timor by the end of
April, before the Council takes a decision at the end of
the mandate of the United Nations Mission of Support
in East Timor.
