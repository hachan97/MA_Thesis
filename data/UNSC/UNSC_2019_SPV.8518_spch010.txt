Mr. Djani (Indonesia): I would like to begin my
statement by reiterating our delegation's full support for
the good offices of the Secretary-General through the
political process led by his Personal Envoy, President
Horst Kohler.

We underscore the pivotal role played by the
United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara (MINURSO) in maintaining peace and stability
in the region, a condition conducive for the peace talks
that include all parties. For that reason, my delegation
welcomes the renewal of the MINURSO mandate and
voted in favour of resolution 2468 (2019).

Understanding the sensitivity of the issue, we
believe that resolution 2468 (2019) very carefully
reflects a delicate balance. We thank the United States,
the penholder, for its efforts aimed at arriving at such
a balance through the engagement with the parties,
Member States and other relevant stakeholders. We
also commend the constructive engagement of all
parties with the political process and call on them to
remain committed to the process and to extend their
fullest support and cooperation to the Personal Envoy
to achieve progress towards a political solution.
