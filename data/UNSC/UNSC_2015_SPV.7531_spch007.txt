Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
voted in favour of resolution 2240 (2015) on the question
of illegal migration in the Mediterranean region just
adopted by the Security Council. China understands
the gravity and urgency of this question and hopes
that the adoption of the resolution will contribute to an
appropriate resolution to it. We also hope that Member
States will implement the resolution in a comprehensive
and accurate manner by scrupulously respecting the
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity
of the countries concerned and giving top priority to
saving innocent lives and protecting human dignity in
strict compliance with the relevant rules of international
law.

The causes of illegal migration are complex. The
international community should take an integrated
approach, focusing on the eradication of extreme poverty,
social unrest and armed conflicts as the root causes. At
the same time, the will of the countries concerned must
be respected. Communication and coordination with
regional and subregional organizations are essential.
We welcome greater efforts to be made by the countries
concerned to that end.
