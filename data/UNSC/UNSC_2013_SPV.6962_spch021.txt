Ms. Bensouda: I also want to express my gratitude
to the members of the Security Council for their words
of encouragement and support for the Office of the
Prosecutor and our work.

While today the Council is not discussing the
situation in Kenya, I find myself compelled to set the
record straight with regard to remarks made by the
Permanent Representative of Rwanda.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) has always
and will always continue to respect the sovereign
equality of all States. However, the ICC will not shy
away from investigating individuals for any alleged
crimes, irrespective of their status. On the basis of the
Permanent Representative of Rwanda's statement, I
must surmise that the information contained in Kenya's
letter to the Council is unfounded and incorrect. It is
a backdoor attempt to politicize the judicial processes
of the Court. The letter referred to by the Permanent
Representative of Rwanda has not been transmitted to
us. We therefore reserve our rights to respond to it in
detail in due course and we hope we will be given that
opportunity once it has been transmitted to us.

Furthermore, it is for the presidency of the
International Criminal Court to assign and reassign
judges to different chambers, depending on the
exigencies ofthe work. I reject as an unfounded attempt
to discredit the work of the International Criminal
Court any insinuation that the reassignment of Judge
Christine Van den Wyngaert has anything to do with
the working methods of the Office of the Prosecutor or
of the Court as a whole.
