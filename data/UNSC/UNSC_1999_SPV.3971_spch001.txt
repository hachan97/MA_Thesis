The President (interpretation from Spanish): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them document
S/ 1999/78, which contains the text of a draft resolution
prepared in the course of the Council's prior consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to document S/1999/7, which contains the text
of a letter dated 30 December 1998 from the Charge
d'affaires ad interim of the Permanent Mission of Austria
to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General.

It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/l999/78) before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put
the draft resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Argentina, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, China, France,
Gabon, Gambia, Malaysia, Namibia, Netherlands,
Russian Federation, Slovenia, United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of
America

The President (interpretation from Spanish): There
were 15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been

adopted unanimously as resolution 1224 (1999).

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 11.50 am.
