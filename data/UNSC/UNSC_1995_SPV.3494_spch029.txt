The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank
the representative of Portugal for the kind words he
addressed to my delegation, especially with regard to our
work.

There are no further speakers.

On behalf of all my colleagues on the Security
Council I should like to thank the Minister of Foreign
Affairs and Cooperation of Mozambique for his presence
here, to wish him a happy return to his country and,
above all, to wish him all success in the task he is
pursuing for his people.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.
