The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Afghanistan, in which he requests
to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President,
Mr. Farhcidi (Afghanistan) took a seat at the
Council table.

The President (spoke in French): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, Special
Representative of the Secretary-General for
Afghanistan.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Brahimi to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in the course of its prior consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, Special
Representative of the Secretary-General for
Afghanistan.

I now give the floor to Mr. Brahimi.
