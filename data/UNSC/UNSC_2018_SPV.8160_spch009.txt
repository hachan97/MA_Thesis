The President (spoke in Russian): In connection
with the planned bilaterals, I am now obliged to
leave this meeting. I will be replaced by Mr. Kairat
Abdrakhmanov, Minister for Foreign of Kazakhstan.
I genuinely thank the Secretary-General and all
those who spoke today, including senior Government
officials, Foreign Ministers of neighbouring countries,
President Duda and Minister Lavrov. I thank them all
for their interest and for the valuable proposals that
have been put forward. I wish the Security Council the
very best in its quest for peace on Earth.
