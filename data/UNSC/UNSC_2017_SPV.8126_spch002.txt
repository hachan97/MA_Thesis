Ms. Tachco (United States of America): The
United States joins the rest of the Security Council
in applauding Iraq's complete implementation of the
measures imposed by the Council under Chapter VII
of the Charter of the United Nations in the oil-for-food
resolutions. That programme started more than 20
years ago, when Iraq was facing grave humanitarian
challenges. Iraq continues to confront many challenges,
but we are encouraged that it has nonetheless been able
to close out this chapter in its history.

We look forward to continuing our close multilateral
cooperation with Iraq through the United Nations and
other organizations, as well as bilaterally, in support of
the Iraqi Government, its citizens and its democracy. We
want nothing more than a unified, federal, democratic
and prosperous Iraq that embraces all of its people and
their values.

Again, we congratulate the Iraqis on this milestone
and wish them continued success as a valued member
of the international community.

The meeting rose at 9.50 am.
