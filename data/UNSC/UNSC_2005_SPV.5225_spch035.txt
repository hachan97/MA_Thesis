Mr. Fendrick (United States of America): Given
the lateness of the hour, I apologize to colleagues for
imposing upon them, and I will be very brief.

The United States regrets the unfortunate and
inaccurate comments of the representative of
Venezuela that mischaracterized the role of the United
States Government and its efforts to support global
peace and security. We believe they have only
detracted from this important debate.
