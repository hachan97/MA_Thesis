Mr. Theron (Namibia): May I commend you, Mr.
President, and your delegation for organizing this
important meeting. We would also like to welcome
Ms. Carla Del Ponte and thank her for her useful briefing.

My delegation attaches great value to the work of
the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia and of the International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda. We commend the Prosecutors, Judges and staff
of the Tribunals for their efforts to promote justice, and
we encourage them to continue. We appreciate Ms. Del
Ponte's active personal involvement in the pursuit of
justice, and we think the Visit she intends to make to
Rwanda will give added impetus to this cause.

As Ms. Del Ponte has correctly stated, the effective
functioning of the Tribunals is subject to the cooperation
of Member States. We therefore call for the continued
cooperation of Member States in the execution of arrest
warrants and in effecting the relocation of witnesses to
third-party States. Similarly, the appeal of the Secretary-
General for the provision of prison facilities for the
incarceration of persons convicted by the Rwanda
Tribunal should also be positively considered by those
Member States that are in a position to do so. It is
absolutely essential that both Tribunals be provided with
the necessary resources to carry out their mandates.

Lastly, my delegation, like that of Canada and
others, also looks forward to a more detailed report from
Ms. Del Ponte following her visit to Rwanda.
