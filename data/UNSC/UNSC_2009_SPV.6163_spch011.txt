Mr. Hoang Chi Trung (Viet Nam): My
delegation wishes to sincerely thank Justice Renate
Winter, President of the Special Court for Sierra Leone,
and Prosecutor Stephen Rapp for their briefings to the
Council on the activities of the Special Court, in
particular the implementation of its completion
strategy. The Vietnamese delegation also welcomes the
presence of the representative of Sierra Leone at our
meeting today.

Viet Nam has been following closely and with
satisfaction the continued achievements of the
Government of Sierra Leone in the implementation of
its agenda for peace consolidation and economic
recovery. Those achievements were recognized in the
sixth report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Integrated Office in Sierra Leone
(S/2008/28l). In that context, the establishment and
operation of the Special Court for Sierra Leone have
proved to be positive contributions to the development
of peace and security in the country.

We would like to take this opportunity to
commend the Special Court for its completed and
ongoing trials, as well as for the important precedents
that the Court has set in international criminal law. We
are following with keen interest the formulation and
implementation of the Special Court's completion
strategy, including the establishment of a residual
mechanism. These will serve as helpful guidelines to
the members of the Security Council in their
consideration of similar issues relating to the two other
international criminal Tribunals for the former
Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
