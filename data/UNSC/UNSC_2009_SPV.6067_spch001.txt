The President (spoke in French): I propose, with
the consent of the Council, to extend an invitation
under rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure to
Mr. Olusegun Obasanjo, Special Envoy of the
Secretary-General on the Great Lakes region.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Obasanjo to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Olusegun Obasanjo, Special Envoy of
the Secretary-General on the Great Lakes region.

I now give the floor to Mr. Obasanjo.
