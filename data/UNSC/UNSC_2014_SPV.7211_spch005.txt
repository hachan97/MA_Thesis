Mr. Hmoud (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): I would
like to thank the Chair of the Committee established
pursuant to resolution 1737 (2006) for his valuable
briefing and for his leadership of its work. We would
also like to thank the Panel of Experts for their high-
quality reports.

Jordan welcomes the efforts of the Committee
to assist international organizations and States in
implementing the relevant resolutions on sanctions
against Iran by responding to the requests of States on
technical issues concerning theirprompt implementation
and by affirming that the Security Council resolutions
on Iran still have the same legal authority despite
the negotiations currently under way on the Iranian
nuclear issue. We encourage the Committee to continue
its investigations of violations by Iran. We call on it
to contact the Iranian Government as the first step in
settling the pending issues with regard to the violations,
in particular those related to the arms shipment seized
from a ship in the Red Sea, which constitutes a clear
violation by Iran of paragraph 5 of resolution 1747
(2007), as well as the incident of carbon fibre seized in
Singapore en route to Iran.

Jordan calls on the Committee to continue to
cooperate with the other sanctions committees in order
to benefit from their expertise. Jordan welcomes the
efforts to reach a comprehensive agreement between
Iran, on the one hand, and the permanent members of
the Security Council and Germany, on the other. At the
same time, we encourage the Committee to continue to
fully carry out its work.
