Mr. Barros Melet (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): On
behalf ofmy country, I would like to begin by expressing
our outrage at the attack carried out yesterday in which
Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-l7 was shot down in
eastern Ukraine, killing 298 people, including children.
We condemn that act in the strongest terms, and we
extend our sympathy and condolences to the victims'
family members and to the Governments whose citizens
were among the victims. No cause can justify an act of
that magnitude and cruelty.

We are closely following the information that is
emerging about what happened. In that context, we
call for carrying out a comprehensive, transparent
and independent investigation in accordance with
international civil aviation standards, in order to ensure
accountability. It is also necessary that all facilities be
provided and security be ensured for the immediate
access of investigators to the crash site in order to
determine its cause with certainty.

There can be no impunity for this type of act. Its
perpetrators must face justice. The victims' family
members have the right to know the truth. We therefore
call upon all States, in accordance with their obligations
under international law and the relevant Security
Council resolutions, to actively cooperate with the
relevant authorities.

The downing of this aircraft, in an area where
there is a high level of political tension, increases the
danger of escalating the current violence and drawing
new actors into the fray. Therefore, more than ever,
we emphatically call on the parties to exercise the
utmost restraint in order to contain the crisis in eastern
Ukraine.
