Mr. Elaraby (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic):
The Egyptian delegation made it clear from the beginning
that the shortfall in Iraqi oil exports is a technical issue to
be dealt with by a procedural, technical resolution that
would allow Iraq to complete the export of the target
amount of oil up to a value of $1 billion in the 90 days
following the implementation of Security Council
resolution 1111 (1997) in order to meet the humanitarian
needs of the Iraqi people. We believe that the two
provisions related to oil exports and the implementation
of the contracts for humanitarian requirements must go
side by side within the same time-frame. I will not hide
the fact that the Egyptian delegation would have preferred
consultations to have continued until consensus had been
reached on the draft.

We welcome the paragraph added this morning to
the draft resolution in which the Security Council
acknowledges the situation concerning humanitarian
supplies to Iraq and encourages the continuing efforts to
Security Council 3817th meeting
Fifty-second year 12 September 1997

 

improve the situation. Such efforts should be undertaken by
all, including the sanctions Committee established by
Security Council resolution 661 (1990). My delegation
would have liked this paragraph to include a frank appeal
to the sanctions Committee to redouble its efforts to
facilitate the supply of humanitarian goods to Iraq in
accordance with paragraph 56 of the Secretary-General's
report (3/1997/685), in which he calls on all parties
involved in the implementation of Security Council
resolution 1111 (1997) to renew their efforts to ensure the
provision and distribution of humanitarian goods and to
minimize the difficulties encountered in the implementation
of the first distribution plan.

The Egyptian delegation agrees with the general thrust
of the draft resolution, which seeks a rapid settlement of the
issue of the shortfall in Iraqi oil exports in order to avoid
any obstacles that could delay or cut off the provision of
humanitarian supplies to the Iraqi people.

In view of this, and of the fears expressed by the
Secretary-General in his latest report regarding the possible
adverse effects on the Iraqi people of any delay in the
provision of humanitarian goods, my delegation will vote
in favour of the draft resolution.
