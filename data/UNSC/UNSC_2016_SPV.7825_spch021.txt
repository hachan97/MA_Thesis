Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
Security Council has very important work to do, and
I do not want to take up any more of members' time.
However, with regard to the statement made by the
United States representative, I would like to emphasize
one point.

How did the situation in Syria come about, and
how did the problems that other countries in the Middle
East are dealing with reach the point where they are

today? Where did they begin, and why? What has been
the role played by the various countries concerned? The
historical record is very clear. Every member of the
Council is very well aware of that. It cannot be changed
by distorting the positions of some countries on the
Council. I have already explained China's position and
do not want to repeat myself.
