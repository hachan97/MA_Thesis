Mr. Zhang Dianbin (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China would like to congratulate Uruguay on taking
up the presidency of the Security Council. We will
continue to support its work and would like to thank
the United States for its leadership during the month
of April. We also thank Ms. Bensouda for her briefing.

China is closely following the development of the
situation in Libya and supports the good offices of
the United Nations in Libya's political transition. We
firmly support the Libyan people's efforts to maintain
national unity and unification. We hope that all parties
in Libya prioritize safeguarding its national interests,
remain committed to a Libyan-led and -owned process
and begin an inclusive political dialogue as soon as
possible. Relevant Council resolutions and the Libyan
Political Agreement should serve as a basis of all
efforts, and disputes should be settled by negotiations
and consultations to find a solution acceptable to
all, promote national reconciliation, restore State
governance and realize peace, stability and development
as soon as possible. That is the prerequisite and basis for
judicial justice in Libya. The international community
should continue to provide support and assistance to
the country.

China's position on the issue of the International
Criminal Court remains unchanged.
