Ms. French (United States ofAmerica): The United
States wishes to commend Peru and Sweden for their
efforts to make sure that the Security Council recognizes
the role of youth in issues of peace and security.

Resolution 2419 (2018), which we havejust adopted,
has a number of important elements. In particular, the
United States appreciates that the Council will now
recognize the role of education and sports in promoting
tolerance and respect for others. Promoting peace
and avoiding conflict starts with developing these
values in our youth, who will be the next generation's
peacemakers. Today's resolution goes a long way
towards recognizing the steps that we need to take.

The United States regrets, however, that the
resolution did not contain language on preventing
violent extremism. This concept is not new, and it
should not be controversial. The goal of the agenda on
preventing violent extremism is to address the factors
that lead some to turn toward violence, so that we stop
the cycle of recruitment into terrorist organizations.
The resolution was a missed opportunity to promote
the fact that youth should be involved when Member
States develop action plans to address the prevention
of violent extremism. United Nations agencies such as
the United Nations Development Programme and the
United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism are deeply
involved in these efforts, and there is no reason why
the Council should not be able to further recognize and
support these critical efforts.

Finally, the Council should not be rolling back
language on technology and the Internet. The resolution
should have used the most recent language on the issue,
as reflected in resolution 2396 (2017). Resolution 2396
(2017) should be our baseline going forward.

We wish once again to thank Peru and Sweden for
their efforts, and we look forward to the Secretary-
General's report on youth in 2020.

The meeting rose at 10.35 am.
