Mr. Baja (Philippines): We voted in favour of
resolution 1556 (2004) in response to the humanitarian
crisis in Darfur. Whether what is happening there is
genocide or ethnic cleansing should not be the priority
question at the moment. The fact is, people are dying,
and women are being raped and homes and property
destroyed. The collective conscience of the
international community must arrest that catastrophe.

Sovereignty also entails the responsibility of a
State to protect its people. If it is unable or unwilling to
do so, the international community has the
responsibility to help that State achieve such capacity
and such will and, in extreme necessity, to assume such
responsibility itself. We voted in favour of resolution

1556 (2004) in that context.

We believe that resolution 1556 (2004) gives the
Sudan the space to seize the opportunity and to meet
the challenge of further addressing its commitments in
Darfur. It is still our hope that, after 30 days, there will
be no need to contemplate the "s word" again and that
the Security Council will find no reason to implement
Article 41 of the Charter of the United Nations, as
called for in paragraph 6, because the Sudan will have
complied with its commitments.

For most intents and purposes, resolution
1556 (2004) is an enlightened resolution and we are
glad to be part of its adoption.
