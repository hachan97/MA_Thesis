Mr. Blok (Netherlands): As we gather in this
Chamber this afternoon, more than half of the people
of the Central African Republic are fleeing the ongoing
violence there. The attacks on civilians, peacekeepers
and humanitarian workers continue, despite the peace
process led by the African Union Initiative for Peace
and Reconciliation in the Central African Republic.
It is clear that the United Nations Multidimensional
Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African
Republic (MINUSCA) has a vital role to play to support
and protect the people of the Central African Republic.
We therefore thank France for its work and leadership
in facilitating the discussion on MINUSCA's mandate
by making extensive efforts to find a compromise
among all members of the Council.

The Kingdom of the Netherlands welcomes the
mandate's renewal for a period of one year. We are
pleased that the Mission's role in the political process
and the mandate for the protection of civilians have been
significantly strengthened by comparison to last year's
mandate. We are also satisfied with MINUSCA's newly
assigned task extending limited logistical support to
the country's armed forces that have been trained by
the European Union Training Mission in the Central
African Republic, which is essential to strengthening
the State's authority. MINUSCA also has an important
role in coordinating international security-sector reform
initiatives, which should be undertaken transparently
and coherently. For these reasons, we regret that the
mandate was not adopted unanimously. We urge all
Council members to work to restore unity in their
support to the people of the Central African Republic.
