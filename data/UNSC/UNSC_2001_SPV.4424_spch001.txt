The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Council agrees to extend an invitation
under rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure to
Mr. Kenzo Oshima, Under-Secretary-General for
Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief
Coordinator.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Oshima to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Kenzo Oshima, Under-Secretary-
General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency
Relief Coordinator.

Members of the Council will be aware that this
meeting is taking place against the background of the
letter dated 21 June 2001 from the President of the
Security Council addressed to the Secretary-General
(S/2001/6l4), following the open debate on the
protection of civilians in armed conflict held on 23
April 2001. In that letter, the members of the Council
indicated that they would welcome a briefing by the
Secretariat on the status of the initiatives outlined in
the letter.

I therefore give Mr. Oshima the floor.
