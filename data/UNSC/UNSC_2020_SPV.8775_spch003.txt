Mr. Dai Bing (China) (spoke in Chinese): Somalia is currently at a critical stage in its national reconstruction. Preparations for the general elections are proceeding steadily and the progress observed in the implementation of its transition plan continues. On the other hand, the country's security situation remains challenging. The mandate renewal provides an opportunity that, in China's view, should be used to update the relevant sanctions measures in the light of the developments on the ground to help Somalia build greater security capacity in the service of the reconstruction process That position of ours guided our active engagement in the consultations on resolution 2551 (2020), during which we proposed many constructive amendments. Regrettably, however, our proposal that the Council explorethe benchmarks forassessing the appropriateness of lifting the arms embargo were not taken on board in the resolution. The current embargo has been a serious impediment to the enhanced security capacity of the Somali Government. The text fails to duly respond to the strong desire of the Somali Government to have the arms embargo lifted. On another note, the current text fails to effectively address the concerns of Djibouti and Eritrea. Both Djibouti and Eritrea are good friends of China, and China encourages them to improve their ties through bilateral consultations. Given the foregoing, and in view of the fact that the resolution failed to duly address China's concerns, it had no choice, but to abstain in the voting.
