Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): With regard to your statement, Madam
President, allow me to once again call your attention
to the fact - stressed by many who took the floor
today i that Russia, Turkey and Iran are doing
their part to ensure that there is compliance with the
cessation of hostilities, which is the best way to bring
about an improvement in the humanitarian situation
in Syria. Neither you, Madam, or Western colleagues
said a single word about what they are doing to improve
the situation. How are they bringing pressure to bear
on the moderate or non-moderate opposition that they
have influence over? Mr. O'Brien, in his briefing, did
directly touch upon those areas that are surrounded or
controlled by terrorists.

The meeting rose at noon.
