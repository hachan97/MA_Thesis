Mr. Nishida (Japan): This is the fifteenth 90-day
report in accordance with paragraph 18 (h) of
resolution 1737 (2006). The report covers the period
from 29 June to 15 September 2010, during which time
the Committee held no meetings but conducted its
work using the silence procedure.

I will begin by noting the follow-up that has been
or is being undertaken in response to resolution 1929
(2010) of 9 June, by which the Security Council
adopted additional measures relating to the Islamic
Republic of Iran. Members will recall that, via
paragraphs 10, 11, 12 and 19 of the resolution, the
Council designated 36 additional persons - all but one
of whom had previously been subject to a travel
notification requirement - as subject to the travel ban.
Moreover, the Council designated one additional
person and 40 additional entities as subject to the
assets freeze.

Subsequently, to reflect these new designations,
the Committee updated its consolidated list of
individuals and entities and issued a note verbale to all
Member States, as well as a press release, drawing
attention to the updated list. I should like to recall here
that the Committee also responded to a query from a
Member State seeking confirmation that certain
individuals and entities had not been designated by the
2
Council or the Committee as subject to the
aforementioned targeted measures.

In paragraph 27 of resolution 1929 (2010), the
Council decided that the Committee shall intensify its
efforts to promote the full implementation of
resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007), 1803 (2008) and
1929 (2010), including through a work programme
covering compliance, investigations, outreach,
dialogue, assistance and cooperation, to be submitted
to the Council within 45 days of the adoption of the
resolution, that is, by 24 July. The Committee approved
such a work programme and transmitted it to the
Council on 23 July.

By paragraph 29 of resolution 1929 (2010), the
Council established, for an initial period of one year
and under the direction of the Committee, a Panel of
Experts to carry out certain tasks, as specified in that
same paragraph. The Committee expects the Panel to
be appointed and operational in the near future and is
committed to establishing a good working relationship
with the Panel upon its constitution.

In paragraph 31 of resolution 1929 (2010), the
Council called upon all States to report to the
Committee within 60 days of the adoption of the
resolution - that is, by 8 August 4 on the steps they
had taken with a view to implementing effectively
paragraphs 7 to 19 and 21 to 24 of the resolution. For
its part, the Committee sent a note verbale to all
Member States, drawing their attention to the
stipulated date of submission, as well as encouraging
those States that had not yet submitted reports pursuant
to either or all of the three previous resolutions to
submit them separately or in combined form. In this
connection, I would like to report that, thus far, the
Committee has received 36 reports under resolution
1929 (2010). The Committee regrets that many States
have not responded in a timely fashion, as these reports
provide important information that helps the
Committee to assess the implementation of the
imposed measures. The Committee reiterates its call on
all Member States to submit such reports if they have
not done so already. Unless a State requests that its
report be kept confidential, the reports will be issued as
official documents and posted on the Committee's
website.

That concludes my summary of the follow-up
triggered by the adoption of resolution 1929 (2010).
10-53435

The Committee received three notifications from
a Member State with reference to paragraph 5 of
resolution 1737 (2006), concerning the delivery of
items for use in the nuclear power plant in Bushehr,
Iran. The Committee also addressed the matter of an
intended delivery of items for use in that plant. In
addition, the Committee received one notification from
a Member State pursuant to paragraph 15 of resolution
1737 (2006), as well as additional specific information
on a prior general notification that had been submitted
previously by another Member State pursuant to the
same paragraph in connection with the receipt and
unfreezing of funds, respectively, in order to make
payments due under contracts entered into prior to the
listing of two entities.
