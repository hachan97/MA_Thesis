Mr. Yel'chenko (Ukraine): My delegation is
delighted to see at the Council table one of the most
prominent statesmen of our epoch, Mr. Nelson Mandela.
Ukraine warmly welcomes his appointment as the new
Facilitator of the Arusha peace process. We would like to
congratulate Mr. Mandela on the energetic start to his
efforts during the meeting in Arusha on 16 January 2000.

We share your assessment, Mr. President, that the
current situation in Burundi remains critical and requires
urgent action on the part of the international community.
We praise your initiative in organizing this meeting to
provide important impetus to mobilizing such
international action. The outspoken support of the
Security Council for the recent invigoration of the Arusha
process is a vivid manifestation of its commitment to
peace in Burundi and in the entire region. We would also
like to encourage the Secretary-General to pursue his
efforts in enhancing the role of the United Nations in
Burundi. Providing urgent relief assistance to those in
need in Burundi is yet another major task at this

 

particular juncture. We are calling for all Burundian parties
to ensure safe and unhindered access for humanitarian
assistance and to guarantee the safety and security of
humanitarian staff in the territory of the country.

At the same time, my Government maintains that the
primary responsibility for the success of the peace process
in Burundi lies with the Burundian people themselves. In
this connection, we have been encouraged by the
responsible stance of those Burundian parties that have
chosen to negotiate their differences. Ukraine joins the
appeal to all other parties in Burundi to cease hostilities and
commit themselves to a political dialogue. The draft
resolution before us today is a clear message to them.
