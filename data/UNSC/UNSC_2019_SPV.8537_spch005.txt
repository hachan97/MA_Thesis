Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I do not intend to
make a full explanation of vote, but I just wanted to
thank colleagues around the table for the constructive
approach they took in this negotiation, and to our
African partners, in particular. I would also like to
thank my expert, Nerys Cross-Smith, for bringing this
to a good conclusion. I wanted to say that this is the
first resolution we have tried following the Greentree
retreat where we took an existing volume of pages
and shortened it and hopefully put it into clearer
language. So certainly from the United Kingdom side,
we commit to the Council to doing that with all our
future resolutions, including where we are renewing
mandates. We invite colleagues to do likewise.

Lastly, I would like to congratulate the President. I
missed the reception last night for which I apologize, but
I thank him for a very important month. We very much
look forward to working with and supporting Kuwait.
