We greatly appreciate the efforts of humanitarian workers on the front lines in Syria. We also strongly support Secretary-General's call for a global ceasefire amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We thank Mr. Lowcock for his briefing. It is encouraging to hear that the ceasefire agreement in the north-east of Syria is holding. Estonia supports efforts of Turkey and Russia to sustain this peace and find a permanent settlement. Looking at cross-border and cross-line humanitarian aid, we want to stress main conclusion of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA): that these are complimentary mechanisms. In order to reach all Syrians, the Security Council needs to maintain both of these mechanisms. We can see how delicate the balance is by looking at what happened in the north-east after the closure of Al-Yarubiyah in January. There is now an acute shortage of aid in multiple locations. According to OCHA, the urgency of the situation grows, as humanitarian aid only reaches one third of facilities previously supported through the cross-border mechanism. We must seriously consider the reopening of Al-Yarubiyah to get to help all those in need. Estonia calls on Security Council members to support the efforts of the humanitarian co-penholders, Belgium and Germany, in renewing cross-border aid in July. That is even more important now, as Syria faces the spread of COVID-19. Finally, as other members of the European Union (EU) have already explained, the EU sanctions do not hinder humanitarian aid or the response to the virus. Life- saving equipment and medical items will always freely reach Syria. EU members also remain the largest humanitarian donors to Syrians across the whole region.
