Mrs. Cedano (Dominican Republic) (spoke in Spanish): The Dominican Republic voted in favour
of draft resolution S/2019/961, presented by the
humanitarian co-penholders for the l2-month renewal
of the cross-border mechanism in the Syrian Arab
Republic, on which millions of Syrians depend for their
survival. We were very sorry that the draft resolution
was not adopted. Exactly the same thing happened
exactly three months ago (see S/PV.8623), when a draft
resolution (S/2019/75 6) that sought to protect the civilian
population of Idlib from attacks and suffering was not
adopted either. We recognize the unstinting efforts of
Belgium, Germany and Kuwait to achieve unity in the
Council on a draft resolution that is essential to the
lives of millions of civilians. We share that aspiration
and worked actively for it. However, we believe that the
Council can still put the needs of the people who hope
for our assistance at the centre of our decisions, so we
reiterate our willingness to continue to seek a way out
of this regrettable situation.
