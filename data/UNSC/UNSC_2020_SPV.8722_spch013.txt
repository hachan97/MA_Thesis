Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): | am not going to repeat what I said before about why we have doubts about whether resolution 2510 (2020) can be implemented. That is what led us to abstain in the voting. We will see; events will show us who was right. If the resolution has a positive impact on resolving the conflict, I will be the first to acknowledge that I was wrong. However, in the form in which it was drafted, we have serious doubts that the resolution will contribute to any kind of resolution, at least in the way that we would like to see. I would like to add that we are accustomed to the United States being obsessed with trying to find a Russian fingerprint in every situation. Instead of trying to find those who are guilty and attaching labels, let us instead remember what led to the current situation in Libya. If members do not recall what that was, let me remind them. A Security Council resolution was blatantly violated in 2011, after which the country, which had been thriving, was destroyed - we know by which countries - and Libyan statehood basically ceased to exist. As a result, Libya became what it became, and we still cannot put it back together again. Furthermore, Libya has become a haven for all types of foreign terrorist fighters from all sorts of countries. I also recall that Russia wanted to include a reference to those terrorists in the resolution. The country that was most against doing so was the United States. Rhetorically, I wonder why.
