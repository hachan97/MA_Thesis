The President: I remind speakers to kindly limit
their statements to no more than four minutes in order
to ensure that we can complete our work expeditiously.
I also appeal to speakers to deliver their statements at a
moderate speed so that interpretation can be provided

properly.

I now give the floor to the Minister for Foreign
Affairs of Latvia.
