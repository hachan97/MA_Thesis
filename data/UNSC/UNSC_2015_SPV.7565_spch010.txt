Mr. Van Bohemen (New Zealand): New Zealand
stands in solidarity with the victims, families, fellow
citizens and Governments who have suffered from the
recent horrendous attacks perpetrated by the Islamic
State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). We are today one
week from the terrible events in Paris, and less than a
day from those in Bamako. As others have noted, those
are but two episodes in a bloody, continuing story.

The Security Council must speak out in times of
crisis. We are pleased that today the Council has sent a
strong, unified message of its shared result to prevent
and suppress the terroist threat posed by ISIL and
other terrorists in Syria and Iraq. In the face of ISIL's
barbarity and senseless killing, we are reminded of the
important role of the Council in uniting the international
community around our shared commitment to peace
and collective security.
