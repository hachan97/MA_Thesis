The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document 8/2009/225, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by the United States of
America. Members of the Council also have before
them document S/2009/211, which contains the report
of the Secretary-General on the Sudan.

It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the
draft resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Austria, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, Japan, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,
Mexico, Russian Federation, Turkey, Uganda,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, United States of America, Viet Nam.

The President (spoke in Spanish): There were
15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 1870 (2009).

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
