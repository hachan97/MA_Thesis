Mr. Tanoh-Boutchoue (Cote d'Ivoire) (spoke in French): Cote d'Ivoire, as a sponsor of resolution
2401 (2017), which we have just adopted and which is
purely humanitarian in nature, commends its initiators,
namely, your country, Mr. President, and Sweden.
It welcomes the adoption of the resolution, which
demands the cessation without delay of hostilities. This
demand on the part of the Council must be upheld by all
actors on every battlefield in Syria.

Cote d'Ivoire also welcomes the efforts undertaken
by all parties to arrive at a consensus within the
Council. It thanks in particular the Russian Federation
for its spirit of compromise. The contribution made by
all parties to the adoption of the resolution is aimed at
saving the Syrian people from the horrific war plaguing
that country, which is imperilling the lives of thousands
of human beings, specifically civilians, including
women and children.

Cote d'Ivoire remains convinced that only a
definitive end to the Syrian conflict through negotiations
can enable all Syrians to restore peace, achieve
reconciliation and rebuild their country, with a view to
relaunching its economic and social development. We
hope that the 30-day truce demanded by the Council
will be the beginning of a process that will bring peace
to Syria on the basis of the relevant conclusions and
recommendations of all negotiations held in Astana,
Sochi and Geneva concerning the country.
