The President (spoke in French): I wish to remind
speakers to limit their statements to no more than
four minutes maximum in order to enable the Council
to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with
lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate
their texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version
when speaking in the Chamber.

I wish also to inform all concerned that we will be
carrying on this open debate right through the lunch
hour, as we have a very large number of speakers.

I now give the floor to the Minister for Foreign
Affairs of Tajikistan.
