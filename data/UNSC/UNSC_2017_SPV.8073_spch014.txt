Mr. Cardi (Italy): As the global non-proliferation
architecture continues to face extremely serious
challenges, the Security Council has the responsibility
to uphold the integrity and credibility of these crucial
long-standing norms for our collective security,
preserving pathways for accountability in the case of
violations. The Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative
Mechanism is a critical tool in that respect, and Italy
fully supported the renewal of its mandate today and
will continue to support it for the future, hoping that
the Security Council will be able to find consensus on
such a key issue. In our view, a timely renewal would
have, contrary to what happened last year, ensured
the continuity and the predictability of the activities
of the Mechanism. It would have helped to retain the
crucial know-how developed by the Mechanism's team
during this year regarding the pressing objective that
we continue to share as allegations of new incidents
continue to emerge.

We are therefore disappointed that the renewal has
been impossible today. The result of the voting not only
risks affecting the future of the Mechanism but also
augments divisions in the Security Council that, frankly,
should not be there and that we hope can be overcome
since upholding the chemical non-proliferation regime
is in everybody's interest. So, while we look forward
to the final report of the Mechanism on the events in
Khan Shaykhun and Om Hush, confident that the report
will confirm the Mechanism's impartiality, objectivity
and independence. We hope that the Council will be
able to find again its unity in the coming weeks on
such crucial issues for our collective security. Fighting
impunity, identifying perpetrators and holding them
accountable must be a shared priority of the Council,
one that unifies us instead of dividing us.
