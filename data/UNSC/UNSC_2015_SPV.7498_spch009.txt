Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): A year
ago, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 crashed in eastern
Ukraine, killing all 298 people aboard. China is deeply
saddened by that tragedy and wishes once again to
express its sympathy to the bereaved families of the
victims and to the countries concerned. We support, in
accordance with resolution 2166 (2014), the holding of
an objective, impartial and independent international
investigation into the incident and the bringing of the
perpetrators to justice.

The current focus should be on establishing the truth
behind the incident and seeking justice for the victims.
China understands the feelings of the sponsors of the
draft resolution and in particular those of the bereaved
families of the victims of the crash of Flight MH-17,
as well as their urgent desire that the perpetrators be
punished.

China participated in the consultations on the draft
resolution and has all along called on the members of
the Council to remain united and meet one another
halfway, accommodate one another's concerns and
avoid political confrontation. If the Security Council
could have achieved consensus on the next step to be
taken concerning that incident, it would have sent out
a positive signal to the effect that the international
community was maintaining a common position on this
issue. It would also have helped to establish the truth of
the incident as soon as possible.

Under circumstances in which some members
of the Council still have major concerns about the
draft resolution, to forcibly push forward a vote could
only result in division among the States members of
the Council. It will not help to ease the grief of the
bereaved families of the victims of the crash of Flight
MH-l7, nor will it help to establish the facts or bring
the perpetrators to justice. For these reasons, China
abstained in the voting on the draft resolution.
