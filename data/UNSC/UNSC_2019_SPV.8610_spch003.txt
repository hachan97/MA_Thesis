Mr. Alotaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At the
outset, we welcome the adoption of resolution 2485
(2019), which renews the mandate of the United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for one year without
amendment of the mandate or a reduction of forces. We
thank France, the penholder, for its professionalism and
constructive cooperation throughout the negotiations.
This unanimous extension reflects the continued support
of the Security Council for UNIFIL's mandate and our
joint belief in UNIFIL's important and significant role,
in close cooperation with the Lebanese Government

and army, for promoting security and stability in the
country and the region.
The negotiations on the draft resolution coincided
with worrisome developments on the ground, in
particular the recent incident involving two Israeli
drones in Beirut. We reiterate our condemnation of
Israel's continued violation of Lebanese sovereignty
and resolution 1701 (2006), as well as its other repeated
airspace Violations, which have been condemned by the
Secretary-General in all his consecutive reports on the
implementation of resolution 1701 (2006). The Security
Council should send a stern message to compel Israel to
stop such violations.

The recent escalation by Israel reaffirms the
importance of UNIFIL's role in alleviating tensions
and maintaining peace and security in south Lebanon.
Preserving that important role is what led us to work
together in order to maintain UNIFIL's mandate and
show our unity in supporting it.

In conclusion, we thank UNIFIL troops for their
efforts and sacrifices, as well as all contributing
countries. We call once again on all parties to respect
the sovereignty, political independence and territorial
integrity of Lebanon as well as its right to take back the
Sheba'a Farms, the Kfar Shuba Hills and the Lebanese
part of Al-Ghajar village, which are occupied by Israel.
