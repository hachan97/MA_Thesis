Mr. Biabaroh-Iboro (Congo) (spoke in French):
I wish on behalf of my delegation to thank the Under-
Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs for his
comprehensive, instructive and moving briefing on the
humanitarian situation in the Central African Republic,
Chad and the Sudan, including Darfur and Southern
Sudan. To be sure, the picture is dark and the
challenges are enormous. The responsibility must be
shared at all levels: the international community, in
particular the Security Council, must shoulder its
portion of the responsibility.

This is a tragic situation affecting the lives of
people who are grave danger. We cannot accept the
notion of the Governments - and more generally
speaking the political authorities - of the countries in
question sidestepping their responsibility. But as the
Under-Secretary-General said so lucidly, the situation
is complex, and no single country can respond to it
alone. We therefore support the Under-Secretary-
General's appeal that solutions be found at the national
level through pressure exerted upon all the political
actors in the countries concerned. In that connection,
the constraints placed on the work of humanitarian
personnel are intolerable, and we condemn them.

At the same time, we lay particular stress on
international assistance, provided through regional
strategies for resolving the serious problems that have
led to the painful situation currently afflicting civilian
populations in the Central African Republic, Chad and
Darfur.
