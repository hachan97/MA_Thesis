Mr. Mantovani (Italy): I too wish to commend
the United Kingdom delegation for its endeavours
during the negotiations leading to today's outcome.

Italy welcomes the adoption of resolution 1828
(2008), on the renewal of the mandate of the African
Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur
(UNAMID). I wish to take this opportunity to express
our strongest support for the force. In that connection,
we also believe it to be absolutely essential that full
deployment of UNAMID be accomplished and that the
force become fully effective in fulfilling its tasks,
especially considering the dire humanitarian situation
and the terrible security conditions of the civilian
population. At the same time, we reaffirm the crucial
importance of the search for a political solution in
Darfur, calling on all parties to engage fully and
constructively in the peace process. To that end, we
welcome the appointment of the joint African Union-
United Nations Chief Mediator, Mr. Djibril Yipene
Bassole.

Italy, as a founding member of the International
Criminal Court (ICC), fully supports the inviolability
of the independence of the Court and its role in
promoting international justice and fighting impunity.
Finally, Italy fully subscribes to the content of the
15 July declaration of the European Union presidency.
