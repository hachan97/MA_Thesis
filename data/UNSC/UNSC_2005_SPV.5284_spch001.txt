The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Haiti, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I request the Chief of Protocol to escort His
Excellency Mr. Gerard Latortue, Prime Minister of the
Republic of Haiti, to a seat at the Council table.

Mr. Ge'rard Latortne, Prime Minister of the
Republic of Haiti, was escorted to a seat at the
Council table.

The President: On behalf of the Council, I
extend a warm welcome to the Prime Minister of the
Republic of Haiti.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2005/63l, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the United Nations Stabilization
Mission in Haiti.

I now invite the Prime Minister of the Republic
of Haiti to make a statement.
