The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2012/ 194, which contains a letter dated
5 April 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the
United States of America to the United Nations
addressed to the Secretary-General transmitting a
concept paper on the item under consideration. I also
wish to draw the attention of members to document
S/2012/207, which contains a letter dated 9 April 2012
from the Permanent Representative of the United States
to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-
General.

I welcome the presence of the Secretary-General,
His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon. I should like to
inform Council members that the Secretary-General
will have to leave for another important engagement at
11.15. I now give him the floor.
