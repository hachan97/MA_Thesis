The President (spoke in Spanish): As this is the
last time that Ambassador John Danforth will
participate in the Council's deliberations in his current
capacity as Permanent Representative of the United
States, I wish to take this opportunity to express to
him, on behalf of the members of the Council, our
appreciation of him as a colleague and friend.
Ambassador Danforth will likely best be remembered
as having initiated and led the Security Council's
meetings in Nairobi, Kenya, on 18 and 19 November
last year, marking the first time in over 30 years that
the Security Council met on the African continent.
Indeed, the fact that the parties were able to sign the
comprehensive peace agreement in Nairobi on
9January is due in no small part to the Council's
efforts, under the leadership of Ambassador Danforth,
to encourage the Naivasha process during its meetings
in the Kenyan capital.

In bidding Ambassador Danforth a fond farewell,
the other members of the Council and I wish him every
success in his new endeavours.
