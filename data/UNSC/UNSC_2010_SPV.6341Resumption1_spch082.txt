The President (spoke in Spanish): After
consultations among members of the Security Council,
I have been authorized to make the following statement
on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council takes note with
appreciation of the ninth report of the Secretary-
General on children and armed conflict
(S/2010/ 181) and the recommendations contained
therein, as well as the positive developments
referred to in the report, and notes the continuing
challenges in the implementation of its resolution
1612 (2005), 1882 (2009) and other relevant
resolutions reflected therein.

"The Security Council reiterates its equally
strong condemnation of all violations of
applicable international law involving the
recruitment and use of children by parties to
armed conflict, as well as their re-recruitment,
killing and maiming, rape and other sexual
violence, abductions, attacks against schools or
hospitals and denial of humanitarian access by
parties to armed conflict. The Council condemns
all other violations of international law, including
international humanitarian law, human rights law
and refugee law, committed against children in
situations of armed conflict. The Council
demands that all relevant parties immediately put
an end to such practices and take special
measures to protect children.

"The Security Council expresses deep
concern about the growing number of attacks or
threats of attacks in contravention of applicable
international law against schools and educational
facilities, and teachers and pupils, in particular
the specific targeting of girls, and in this regard
calls upon all parties to armed conflict to cease
immediately these violations of international
humanitarian law.

"The Security Council welcomes the steps
taken by the Secretary-General in the
implementation of resolution 1882 (2009) by
including in the annexes of his report those
parties to armed conflict that engage, in
contravention of applicable international law, in
patterns of killing and maiming of children and/or
rape and other sexual violence, in situations of
armed conflict.

"The Security Council calls upon the
Secretary-General to redouble his efforts to
ensure the strengthening of the monitoring and
reporting mechanism's capacities with a view to
the implementation of resolution 1882 (2009) to
allow for prompt advocacy and effective response
to all violations and abuses committed against
children, inter alia, by ensuring that all relevant
United Nations agencies actively help to collect
accurate, objective, reliable and verifiable
information on acts of rape and other sexual
violence committed against children; and also by
ensuring synergies and avoiding overlap among
relevant United Nations entities at the
headquarters and country levels, as requested by
resolutions 1882 (2009) and 1888 (2009).

"The Security Council reaffirms its decision
in operative paragraph 11 of its resolution 1882
(2009) to continue to include specific provisions
for the protection of children in the mandates of
all relevant United Nations peacekeeping,
peacebuilding and political missions, encourages
the deployment of child protection advisers to
such missions and calls upon the Secretary-
General to ensure that such advisers are recruited
and deployed in line with the Council's relevant
country-specific resolutions and the Department
of Peacekeeping Operations policy directive on
mainstreaming the protection, rights and
well-being of children affected by armed conflict.
It further underscores the importance of training
on child rights and child protection for all
personnel involved in United Nations
peacekeeping, peacebuilding and political
missions, and in this regard welcomes the
ongoing efforts by the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations in developing the
policy implementation plan, including training
programmes and materials.

"The Security Council welcomes the
50

progress made in preventing and responding to
violations and abuses committed against children
especially with regard to the signing of action
plans by some parties, as mentioned in the ninth
report of the Secretary-General.

"The Security Council reiterates its call on
parties to armed conflict listed in the annexes of
the Secretary-General's report on children and
armed conflict that have not already done so to

prepare and implement, without further delay,
action plans to halt recruitment and use of
children, patterns of killing and maiming of
children and/or rape and other sexual violence
against children, in violation of applicable
international law, in situations of armed conflict.

"The Security Council also reiterates its call
on all parties listed in the annexes to the
Secretary-General's report on children and armed
conflict to address all other violations and abuses
committed against children and to undertake
specific commitments and measures in this
regard.

"The Security Council expresses deep
concern that certain parties persist in committing
violations and abuses against children, and
expresses its readiness to adopt targeted and
graduated measures against persistent
perpetrators, taking into account the relevant
provisions of its resolutions 1539 (2004), 1612
(2005) and 1882 (2009).

To this end, the Council invites:

(a) its Working Group on Children and
Armed Conflict to exchange pertinent
information with relevant sanctions committees,
in particular through the communication of the
Working Group's relevant recommendations;

(b) its relevant sanctions committees to
consider inviting more regularly the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General for
Children and Armed Conflict to brief them on
specific information contained in the Secretary-
General's reports;

(c) and the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General for Children and Armed
Conflict to share specific information contained
in the Secretary-General's reports with the expert
groups of relevant sanctions committees.
"The Security Council expresses its
intention, when establishing or renewing the
mandate of relevant sanctions committees, to
consider provisions pertaining to parties that are
in violation of applicable international law
relating to the rights and protection of children in
armed conflict.

"The Security Council expresses its
readiness to consider specific recommendations
from its Working Group on Children and Armed
Conflict on violations and abuses committed
against children by parties listed in the annexes of
the Secretary-General's reports, whenever they
occur, with a View to considering action on them,
without prejudging or implying a decision by the
Security Council as to whether or not to include a
particular situation in its agenda.

"The Security Council calls on concerned
Member States to take decisive and immediate
action against persistent perpetrators of violations
and abuses committed against children in
situations of armed conflict and further calls on
them to bring to justice those responsible for such
violations that are prohibited under applicable
international law, including with regard to the
recruitment and use of children, killing and
maiming, and rape and other sexual violence,
through national justice systems and, where
applicable, international justice mechanisms and
mixed criminal courts and tribunals, with a view
to ending impunity for those committing crimes
against children.

"Given the regional dimensions of some
armed conflicts referred to in the Secretary-
General's report, the Security Council reiterates
its request that United Nations peacekeeping,
peacebuilding and political missions, as well as
United Nations country teams, within their
respective mandates and in close cooperation
with the Governments of the concerned countries,
develop appropriate strategies and coordination
mechanisms for cooperation and the exchange of
information on cross-border child protection
issues.

"The Security Council welcomes the overall
work of the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General for Children and Armed
Conflict and highlights the importance of her
field visits in enhancing dialogue with concerned
Governments and parties to the conflict,
including by negotiating action plans, securing
commitments, advocating for appropriate
response mechanisms and ensuring appropriate
attention and follow-up to the conclusions and
recommendations of the Security Council
Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict.

"The Security Council also welcomes the
efforts undertaken by the United Nations
Children's Fund in carrying out its mandate on
child protection by supporting the overall
development and implementation of the
monitoring and reporting mechanism and
ensuring an appropriate response to the question
of children in armed conflict, and encourages it to
continue to follow up, through the monitoring and
reporting mechanisms of the country task forces,
on relevant conclusions and recommendations of
the Working Group of the Security Council on
Children and Armed Conflict.

"The Security Council welcomes the
sustained activity of its Working Group on
Children and Armed Conflict and stresses the
importance of continuing to adopt timely
conclusions and recommendations in line with
resolutions 1612 (2005) and 1882 (2009).
Furthermore, the Council invites the Working
Group to fully implement its toolkit
(S/2006/724), inter alia, by carrying out a
country-specific visit within one year to examine
a situation referred to in the annexes of the
Secretary-General's report in order to better fulfil
its mandate and enhance its capacity to protect
children affected by armed conflict.

"Recalling previous presidential statements
on children and armed conflict, as well as
paragraph 18 of resolution 1882 (2009), the
security Council reiterates its request to the
Secretary-General to provide administrative and
substantive support for its Working Group on
Children and Armed Conflict and further requests
the Secretary-General to take action on this
subject within one month of this date.

"The Security Council requests the
Secretary-General to submit a report by May
2011 on the implementation of its resolutions and
presidential statements on children and armed
conflict, including the present statement."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2010/ 10.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of
its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 8 p.m.
