Mr. Rycroft (United Kingdom): This is a really
important issue, and I want to thank all the briefers.
Their presentations were very valuable indeed. One
fascinating insight that I learned this morning is that
19 per cent of the police in the African Union-United
Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur are women,
inspiring Darfuri women and girls.

United Nations policing is at the front line of our
work. Policemen and policewomen under the United
Nations flag help communities at risk of violence,
they respond to incidences of disorder and they
provide technical expertise to improve domestic police
services in fragile States. But United Nations policing
concentrates its efforts disproportionately on day-to-
day security in fragile States, at the expense of capacity-
building elsewhere. Therefore, the big question is how
we can change that so that United Nations policing can
realize its potential.

Rather than make a full statement today, I would
like to hear from everyone around the table. In the
interest of modernizing our working methods, I will
now give up the floor.
