The President: I thank Mr. Guehenno for his
statement.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I shall give the floor to three
Council members, followed by two non-Council
members. I shall follow that alternating arrangement
until the list of speakers is exhausted.

I wish to remind all speakers to limit their
statements to no more than five minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to circulate their texts in writing and to
deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.

As a measure to optimize the use of our time in
order to allow as many delegations as possible to take
the floor, I will not individually invite speakers to take
seats at the table or to resume their seats at the side of
the Chamber. When a speaker is taking the floor, the
Conference Officer will seat the next speaker on the
list at the table.

I thank participants for their understanding and
cooperation.
