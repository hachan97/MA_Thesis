Mr. Annabi: I will gladly convey to the Special
Representative and to all the staff of the United
Nations Mission of Support in East Timor the kind
words of Council members regarding the work of the
Mission over the past three years. There is no doubt
that Timor-Leste has achieved a lot in very little time,
and the United Nations is proud to have had the
privilege of accompanying the people of Timor-Leste
in their efforts over the past five and a half years to
build sustainable and democratic State institutions.

Some speakers described the role of the United
Nations in Timor-Leste as a model for successful
peacekeeping and as a remarkable success story.
Success in the real world, of course, is often less well
remembered than some of the setbacks that we
encounter. Let us hope that this success will be duly
remembered. But at a time when the United Nations is
closing a chapter in the history of its involvement in
East Timor and opening a new one, I think that we
should remember most of all the exemplary work of
Sergio Vieira de Mello, who devoted two and a half of
the last years of his life to assisting the people of East

Timor to prepare for and achieve their longÂ»cherished
goal of sovereignty and independence. He will remain
a role model for all those who believe in what the
United Nations stands for.
