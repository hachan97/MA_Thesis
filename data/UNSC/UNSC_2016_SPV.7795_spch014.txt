Mr. Gimolieca (Angola): We thank under Under-
Secretary-General Mr. Stephen O'Brien for his briefing
and commend him once again for his tireless efforts
to facilitate access for humanitarian agencies and to
contribute to reaching a sustainable solution to the
humanitarian needs of the millions of civilians in
Syria. In the current environment, in which the United
Nations and humanitarian agencies are operating
in increasingly dangerous and difficult conditions,
we must commend all those who keep risking their
lives to help the desperate civilians trapped in this
horrendous conflict.

In the past few weeks, we have witnessed an
intense escalation of fighting, especially in the city
of Aleppo, which has resulted in massive destruction
of civilian and other essential infrastructure, as well
as an overwhelming number of casualties, wounded
and displaced people. It is obvious that unless there
is progress in bridging the differences between the
main stakeholders, in particular on the strategy
to combat terrorist groups, the humanitarian and
political crises will deepen, with dangerous and
unpredictable consequences.

The humanitarian situation must be combined
with diplomatic and political efforts towards a final
resolution of the conflict. Disagreements among the
members of the Council, and in particular between those
involved in the conflict, will not bring peace to Syria.
Therefore, we reiterate our support to the members of
the Security Council that have been trying to galvanize
our collective efforts to press for the relaunching of the
agreement on the cessation of hostilities and for the
establishment of humanitarian corridors in the worst
affected areas.
