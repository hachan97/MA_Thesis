Mr. Ladsous (France) (interpretation from French):
The French delegation has carefully studied the report the
Secretary-General has issued on the situation in Liberia.
This report gives a grim account of the consequences of the
clashes in Monrovia last April in humanitarian and
economic terms. It also shows the grave consequences for
the United Nations Mission, most of whose staff had to
be withdrawn and a great deal of whose equipment has
been looted. The French delegation vigorously condemns
these misdeeds, and will attach special importance to the
return of this equipment.

The new plan for the implementation of the Abuja
Agreement, revised by the States of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) during its
last meeting, on 14 and 17 August, gives rise to new
hopes. We would like to pay tribute to the renewed
efforts of the regional leaders in this matter.

We know how guarded hope should be in this
respect, since experience has shown that the factions have
several times disregarded their commitments. We venture
to believe, as is indicated in the Secretary-General's
report, that the sanctions accompanying the plan will be
an important guarantee of its implementation. Yet another
failure would be tragic, for it could lead to a withdrawal
of the international community, to a widespread renewal
of fighting and to a major threat to stability in the region.

France has constantly given its support to the peace
process in Liberia. It will do so once again by agreeing,
as is recommended by the Secretary-General, to extend
the mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in
Liberia (UNOMIL) for a three-month period. It also
supports the intentions of the Secretary-General with
regard to the deployment of the Mission.
