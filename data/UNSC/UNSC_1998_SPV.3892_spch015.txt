The President: I thank the representative of Malaysia
for the kind words he addressed to me and to my
predecessor.

I should like to inform the Council that I have
received a letter from the representative of Albania, in
which he requests to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Nesho (Albania)
took a seat at the side of the Council Chamber.
The President: I invite the representative of Albania
to take a seat at the Council table and to make his
statement.
