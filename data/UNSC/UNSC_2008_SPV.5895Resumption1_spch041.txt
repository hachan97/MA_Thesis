The President: Thank you very much, Sir, for
that very thoughtful statement and the focus on
integration.

Before giving the floor to the next speaker, may I
note that we have 12 more speakers on the list. The
interpreters have kindly agreed to continue past
6 o'clock, but I encourage remaining speakers to stick
to the limit set at the beginning; that would be very
helpful.

The next speaker is the representative of
Honduras, to whom I give the floor.
