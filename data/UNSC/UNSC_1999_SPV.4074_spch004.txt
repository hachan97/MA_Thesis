Mr. Gatilov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation will abstain in the
voting on the draft resolution on the United Nations
Civilian Police Mission in Haiti for reasons of principle
that can be summarized as follows.

First, by extending the mandate of the Mission, the
Security Council once again is in breach of its own
decision and truly is placing itself in an absurd position.
The fact that in the text the words "to continue" are used
instead of "to extend the mandate" does not change the
essence of the matter. We View it as merely an attempt to
camouflage the true meaning of this event.

Secondly, and most importantly, the President of
Haiti, Rene Preval, in his letter dated 8 November, clearly
set forth his position. He thanked the United Nations for
the work of the Civilian Police Mission in Haiti and
expressed the desire that a new mission be established
whose members would be neither uniformed nor armed.
This approach is at variance with what is stated in the
draft resolution before us.

 

We believe that the Security Council should not
take a decision to extend the mandate of the United Nations
Civilian Police Mission in Haiti since no official written
request to that effect from the Haitian Government has been
received.

In conclusion, we deem it important to emphasize that
the Russian Federation will support the establishment of the
International Civilian Support Mission in Haiti, because we
are convinced of the need for a further United Nations
presence in that country. The main thing is that this
presence should be multifaceted and should not be at
variance with the wishes of the host country.
