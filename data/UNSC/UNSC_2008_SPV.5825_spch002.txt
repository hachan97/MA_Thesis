Mr. Acharya (Nepal): I am taking the floor to
express my sincere appreciation and thanks to you,
Mr. President, and all the other members of the Council
for your constructive support in the process of adopting
this resolution extending the mandate of the United
Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN). I also take this
opportunity to especially thank the British delegation
for taking pains in drafting and arriving at a consensus
on the resolution.

I also take this opportunity to thank the
Secretary-General for his comprehensive report on the
subject (S/2008/5), reflecting the developments on the
ground and developments in the peace process in
Nepal. I also want to express my sincere appreciation
and thanks to the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General, Mr. Ian Martin, for all the work he
has done during the process and to the team of officials
of the Secretariat who have been helping with the
process.

With the adoption of this resolution, I am
confident that during the next six months Nepal will be
able to achieve progress in the peace process, including
the holding of Constituent Assembly election in April
2008. I want to assure you, Sir, and the other members
of the Council that Nepal will fully cooperate with the
Special Representative and UNMIN in implementing
the mandate that has been adopted.
