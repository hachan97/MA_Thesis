Mr. Kooijmans (Netherlands): The Netherlands
will vote in favour of the extension of the mandate of
the United Nations Organization Mission in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) for a
period of two months.

The extension of the mandate for a brief period
will put the parties to the conflict on notice that for the
United Nations to remain involved in the peace process
on the basis of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement, which,
in our View, remains the most viable basis for the
resolution of the conflict, we expect the parties to
demonstrate their full commitment to the Lusaka
process in the months ahead.

In this respect, we call in particular on the
Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
to facilitate effectively the MONUC deployment and to
commit itself fully to a meaningful dialogue with the
Congolese parties. Furthermore, the Netherlands calls
on the parties to start, in accordance with the
provisions of resolution 1304 (2000), the withdrawal of
troops and to end all military offensives.

The Netherlands strongly supports the Secretary-
General in his efforts to help establish peace in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo and looks forward
to his recommendations on the future of MONUC
operations, including its concept of operations.
