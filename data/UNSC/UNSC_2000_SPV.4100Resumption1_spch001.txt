The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Norway, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Kolby
(Norway), took the seat reserved for him at the side
of the Council Chamber.

The President (spoke in Spanish): The next speaker
inscribed on my list is Mrs. Sylvie Junod, head of the
delegation of the International Committee of the Red Cross
to the United Nations. I invite her to take a seat at the
Council table and to make her statement.
