Mr. Ordeman (United States of America): I
apologize for taking the floor at this late hour, but I feel
that we have no other choice.
We did in fact engage in a statement that the Russian
Federation had proposed. We had hoped that it would
track with the actual situation on the ground, as opposed
to applying an approach that had been used with Haiti.
With that in mind, we had hoped to note that Maduro
had been given numerous opportunities to engage in
good-faith efforts to address Venezuela's political
and socioeconomic issues and that he has consistently
used such opportunities to consolidate the power of
his regime, at the expense of the Venezuelan people.
We therefore would have liked the Security Council to
underscore the importance ofa true democratic process,
and that that would have been allowed to proceed.
