The President (spoke in F rench): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter dated
23 March 2004 from the Permanent Representative of
Algeria to the United Nations, which reads as follows:

"In accordance with rule 39 of the
provisional rules of procedure of the Security
Council, I have the honour to request you to
authorize His Excellency Mr. Yahya Mahmassani,
Ambassador, Permanent Observer of the League
of Arab States to the United Nations, to address
the Council in the course of the open debate on
the situation in the Middle East, including the
Palestinian question, to be held on 23 March
2004."

That letter will be published as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/2004/236.

If I hear no objection, I shall take it that the
Council agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 to
His Excellency Mr. Yahya Mahmassani.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Yahya
Mahmassani took the seat reservedfor him at the
side of the Council Chamber
