invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Jan Egeland, Under-Secretary-
General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency
Relief Coordinator.

I invite Mr. Egeland to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

At this meeting the Security Council will hear a
briefing my Mr. Jan Egeland. Under-Secretary-General
for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief
Coordinator.

There have not yet been any requests from
representatives of interested countries to be invited to
take part in this discussion. Moreover, as there is no
list of speakers for this meeting, I would invite Council
members who wish to take the floor to so indicate to
the Secretariat as from now.

I now give the floor to Mr. Egeland.
