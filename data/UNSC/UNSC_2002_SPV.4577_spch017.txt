The President: Thank you very much indeed,
Ms. McAskie, for that very comprehensive briefing. It
has been drawn to my attention that I am already
failing to meet my own standards in terms of
timekeeping, because I am asking too many questions,
but I should like to ask you one question. In a way, I
think you answered it in your last point, about
resources. It relates to the way in which donors have
responded to the humanitarian crisis. That has been a
priority for the United Nations, but do you consider the
donor response to have been effective and adequate?
