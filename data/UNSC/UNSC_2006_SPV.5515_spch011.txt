The President: I would like to note that
Ambassador Duclos is making his last appearance in
the Security Council in his capacity as Deputy
Permanent Representative of France. I understand that
he is leaving for another important posting. On behalf
of the Council, I would like to express our gratitude to
him for his cooperation and for his positive
contribution to the work of the Council. I am confident
that he will use the knowledge and experience acquired
in the course of his work here in discharging his new
responsibilities. We wish him well.
