Mr. Araud (France) (spoke in French): I should
like to thank the United States delegation for its efforts,
which have allowed us today to adopt two important
resolutions that my country was pleased to co-sponsor.

With the ambitious reform of the sanctions
regime established by resolution 1267 (1999), I think
that we have achieved our objective: to improve the
effectiveness of the United Nations sanctions regime as
a tool for fighting terrorism and strengthening its
legitimacy. The establishment of two separate
sanctions regimes makes it possible to adapt our tools
to a threat that has been constantly changing for 10
years and that will continue to evolve after the death of
Osama Bin Laden.

The links between Al-Qaida and the Taliban have
not disappeared, but they are not the same as in 1999.
We must draw lessons from this. In encouraging the
Taliban to join the inter-Afghan reconciliation process,
the new sanctions regime will contribute to the efforts
that the Afghan Government, with the support of the
international community, is making in order to reach a
political solution to the conflict in Afghanistan.

The improvements made to and the guarantees
included in the sanctions regime against Al-Qaida
allow us to respond to the criticisms that have been
made, including by judicial authorities in Europe and
elsewhere. The strengthening of the powers of the
Mediator, greater transparency and flexibility in
deciding on possible de-listings create conditions for a
procedure that more equitable. Our determination to
fight terrorism remains intact. With these two regimes,
we have a tool that is commensurate with our
ambitions and that is adapted to the current state of the
terrorist threat.
