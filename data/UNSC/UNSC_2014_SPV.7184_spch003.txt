The President: I thank Ambassador Murmokaite
for her briefing.

I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the
Chair of the Security Council Committee pursuant to
resolution 1540 (2004).

I am pleased to report to the Council on the
progress made in the implementation ofresolution 1540
(2004) since my last briefing in November 2013 (see S/PV.7071).

At the outset, I would like to express my
appreciation for the support given by the members of
the Security Council and the Secretariat to the work of
the 1540 Committee, in particular the Security Council
open debate held on 7 May (see S/PV.7169), on the topic
"Commemorating the tenth anniversary of resolution
1540 (2004) and looking ahead", which was held
successfully. More than 60 Member States expressed
their strong commitment to the implementation of the
resolution. As encapsulated in presidential statement
S/PRST/2014/7, adopted at that meeting and echoed
by many, the 1540 Committee was recommended
to consider developing a strategy towards the full
implementation of resolution 1540 (2004). In the same
vein, the Committee will continue to enhance the
ongoing cooperation among relevant Committees as
necessary, as well as to coordinate its non-proliferation
work with other international, regional and subregional
organizations.

On the promotion of a universal reporting, the
Committee received one additional initial report over the
past six months, bringing the number of non-reporting
States down to 21. With the support of the Group of
Experts and the United Nations Office of Disarmament
Affairs (UNODA), three special meetings are being
held to engage and assist the remaining Member States.
By the end of June, we will have engaged 19 out of the
21 non-reporting States.

Since the last joint briefing, the 1540 Committee
and its experts made two country visits, to Niger and
Bangladesh at their invitations, and also participated
in 46 outreach events worldwide. They provided
excellent opportunities to further the implementation
of resolution 1540 (2004) and facilitate assistance
to support capacity-building in many States. The
Committee has also embarked on the compilation of
effective practices. I take this opportunity to thank
all those Member States and international, regional
and subregional organizations for submitting useful
information in that regard. Facilitating matchmaking
between assistance requests and offers also remains a
priority for the Committee. We will review practical
recommendations for strengthening our assistance
mechanism in the coming weeks. I look forward to
reporting that outcome to the Council at the next
briefing in November.

Since the last joint briefing on 27 November 2013,
we also received new formal notifications of 15 points
of contact. To date, the Committee has been advised
of points of contact for 79 States and 12 international
and regional organizations. A special meeting was
held in early April in Vienna, organized by UNODA
and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe. Points of contact from States, as well as from
international organizations, were brought together to
share experiences. That is an encouraging step in our
efforts to move towards the development of a living
network of points of contact.

I would like to conclude by reiterating the
Chair's commitment towards achieving universal
and full implementation of resolution 1540 (2004).
As we celebrate the tenth anniversary of that seminal
resolution, there is a substantial agenda before us.
Under the guidance of the thirteenth programme of
work, which was submitted to the Council last week,
the 1540 Committee will continue to actively cooperate
with all stakeholders to address all aspects of the
resolution in preventing the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction to non-State actors. The collaboration
between the Committees established pursuant to
resolutions 1267 (1999) and 1989 (2011), 1373 (2001)
and 1540 (2004) and their experts is crucial in that
regard, and I look forward to sustained cooperation in
the future.

I resume my function as President of the Council.

I give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Gary Quinlan,
Chair of the Security Council Committee established
pursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999) and 1989 (2011)
concerning Al-Qaida and associated individuals and
entities.
