Mr. Pereyra Plasencia (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): Peru voted in favour of this resolution, which

06-4649]

calls for a complete cessation of hostilities and which
we trust will mark the beginning of the end to the
destruction and the violence that have claimed so many
innocent lives in Lebanon and in northern Israel. That
is why we urge the parties to the conflict to comply
immediately and scrupulously with the cessation of
hostilities for which this resolution calls. We are
confident that that will enable humanitarian assistance
to reach populations in need as soon as possible.

We also ask that the strengthening of the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) under the
terms authorized by this resolution take place as soon
as possible so that the Force can, together with the
Lebanese army, move in and fulfil the mandate with
which it has been entrusted. That action, in parallel
with the withdrawal of the Israeli army, is essential for
compliance with this resolution. Likewise, we trust that
the principles and elements included in this resolution
with a view to a definitive solution can be addressed as
soon as possible by the Governments of Lebanon and
of Israel.

Finally, Peru expresses its entire willingness to
continue to work constructively in the Security Council
to contribute to the reaching of a definitive solution to
this conflict.
