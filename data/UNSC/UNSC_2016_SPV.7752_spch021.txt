Mr. Aboulatta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I should
like to make the following clarification. As I said in
my explanation of vote, resolution 2303 (2016) does not
refer to the African Union's monitors. My delegation
had proposed including such a reference in the draft,
but one of the penholders objected to its inclusion.
