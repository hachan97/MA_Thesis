Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I will be very brief. Fortunately, the
Secretariat has established detailed protocols for the
Security Council that cover all the questions that the
representative of the United States touched on just
now and that save me the trouble of a more extensive
reaction to her remarks.
