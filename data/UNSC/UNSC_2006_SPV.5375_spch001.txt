The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Algeria, Austria, Brazil, Indonesia,
Israel and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in
which they request to be invited to participate in the
consideration of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the discussion, without the right to
vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, the
representatives of the aforementioned countries
took the seats reservedfor them at the side of the
Council Chamber.

The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council

(1999), concerning Al-Qaida and the Taliban and
associated individuals and entities; and Ambassador

(2004).

It is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

I wish to draw the attention of the members of the
Council to documents S/2005/800 and S/2006/ 107,
which contain letters dated 15 December 2005 and
15 February 2006, respectively, from the Chairman of
the 1373 Committee and addressed to the President of
the Security Council.

At this meeting, we will hear briefings by the
Chairmen of the 1373 Committee, the 1267 Committee
and the 1540 Committee.

I now give the floor to Ambassador Ellen
Margrethe Loj, Chairman of the Security Council
Committee established pursuant to resolution 1373
