Mr. Baja (Philippines): We sponsored the
resolution just adopted in recognition of the clear and
present danger of weapons of mass destruction that
could be used for terrorist activities falling into the
hands of non-State actors.

There is a serious gap in existing regimes in
terms of addressing this threat to international peace
and security; that consideration should override any
legal niceties regarding the resolution's possible
political or technical implications, which may or may
not materialize. The negotiation process on this
resolution incorporated positive elements into the
original draft text, particularly regarding the fulfilment
of obligations related to arms control and disarmament,
non-infringement upon existing treaty regimes,
peaceful settlement of disputes and clarification of the
role and mandate of the follow-up mechanism.

The resolution reflects the Philippine
Government's serious policy of countering terrorism.
We acknowledge assurances that the resolution does
not ipso facto authorize enforcement action against
States that fail or are unable to comply with the
obligations set forth by the resolution and does not
preclude future multilateral agreements on the subject.
We believe this resolution signals the seriousness, not
only of the Council, but also of the entire international
community with regard to preventing the trafficking of
weapons of mass destruction to non-State actors. The
Philippines will of course act seriously in the
implementation of this resolution.
