The President: On behalf of the members of the
Security Council, I should like to condemn the deadly
shooting that occurred on Saturday at the Tree of Life
congregation synagogue in Pittsburgh. This hateful act
led to the deaths of ll civilians, targeted at their place of
worship. The members of the Security Council express
their deepest condolences to the families and loved
ones of those killed, and they offer their sympathy to
the people and the Government of the United States.

I ask those present to now rise in a minute of silence
in honour of the memory of the victims.
