We have repeatedly set out our concerns about Iran's destabilizing behaviour in the region, including through the transfer of weapons to Yemen, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq, in violation of resolution 2231 (2015). We therefore share the concerns expressed by a number of Council members about the scheduled expiry of the existing arms restrictions on Iran this October. The E-3 Foreign Ministers have been clear that the expiry of these restrictions would have major implications for regional security and stability. The United Kingdom abstained in the voting on this draft resolution (S/2020/797) because it was clear that it would not attract the support of the Council and would not represent a basis for achieving consensus. It would therefore not contribute to improving security and stability in the region. Nevertheless, we stand ready to work with Council members and the participants of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to seek a path forward that could secure the support of the Council. The United Kingdom remains resolutely committed to the JCPOA and to preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. With our French and German colleagues, we are committed to taking forward the JCPOA's dispute resolution mechanism negotiations, with the desire to bring Iran back into compliance with the agreement. We do not support a move to snapback at this time, which would be incompatible with our current efforts to preserve the JCPOA.
