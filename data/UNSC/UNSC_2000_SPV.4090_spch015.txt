The President: We very much share the heartfelt
sentiments expressed by the representative of Mali,
particularly at the end of his statement, when he referred to
the tragic loss of the United Nations Special Representative,
his illustrious compatriot, Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye, As
President of the Council, I wish to express the unanimity
with which we share that last expression of concern.
