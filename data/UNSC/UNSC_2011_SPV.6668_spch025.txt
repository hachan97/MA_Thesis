Mr. Fedotov: In the United Nations, if one has
the floor, one uses it, so I would like to take this
opportunity to once again thank you, Mr. President, the
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal, for having
taken the initiative to convene today's meeting of the
Security Council.

For me, it was very important to listen to the
Council's members, whose views and opinions are
quite important and relevant to the practical action of
the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime
(UNODC). Indeed, we do have our own governing
bodies, but administratively we are part of the
Secretariat and it is only natural for us to brief the
Security Council as often as it so wishes. And the more
we have a dialogue with the Security Council and with
all the entities and Member States, the more chance we
have of succeeding in our efforts to curb drug
trafficking and organized crime, which are major
destabilizing factors in the twenty-first century. I
would like once again to thank the members of the
Security Council for their support of UNODC, and,
since we have in this Chamber some outstanding
contributors to the UNODC budget, I would like to
take this opportunity to thank them and express our
appreciation for their support.
