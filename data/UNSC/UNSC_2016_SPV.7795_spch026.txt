The President (spoke in Russian): I believe that, as
President of the Council, I can express the certainty that
United Nations humanitarian personnel will continue
their difficult work in Syria, as Mr. O'Brien said.

In my national capacity, however, I cannot fail to
note that it is clear from Mr. O'Brien's response that
he has no information supporting the contention that
Russian and Syrian forces have been bombing over
the past seven days, just as he has no information that
chemical weapons have been used in eastern Aleppo
at any point in time. I just want to point that out for
the record.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

I suggest that after the discussion we have just had
there is no need to continue with consultations. We
have had a briefing and consultations at the same time.

The meeting rose at 5.20 pm.
