The President (spoke in French): I thank the
representative of Djibouti for his kind words.

I should like to inform the Council that I have
received a letter from the representative of Israel in
which he requests to be invited to participate in the
discussion on the item on the Council's agenda. In
accordance with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite the representative of
Israel to participate in the discussion without the right
to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional
rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Lancry
(Israel) took the seat reserved for him at the side
ofthe Council Chamber.

The President (spoke in French): The next
speaker on my list is the representative of
Liechtenstein, whom I invite to take a seat at the
Council table and to make his statement.
