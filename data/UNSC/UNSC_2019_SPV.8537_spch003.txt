Mr. Adom (Cote d'Ivoire) (spoke in French): As
your presidency draws to a close, Mr. President, we
would like to commend you for your efforts to ensure
that our work is carried out in the best conditions. We
thank you for your excellent work.

My delegation welcomes the adoption of resolution
2472 (2019), which renews the mandate of the African
Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) for one year. We
particularly welcome the fact that the Security Council
adopted it unanimously. We thank the United Kingdom,
in its capacity as penholder and facilitator for the
negotiations. We also thank the other delegations for
their active contributions and their sense of compromise,
without which this welcome and vital consensus would
not have been possible.

Cote d'Ivoire believes that the presence ofAMISOM
in Somalia is essential during the ongoing transition
process, given the current security context. My country
therefore welcomes that the resolution recognizes the
Mission's fundamental role and important contributions
to the creation of security conditions conducive to the
building of the State of Somalia.

It is our Council's duty to encourage AMISOM. and
help it fully carry out its mission in order to consolidate
the current gains, which, although precarious, are still
encouraging. That is why we particularly welcome
that the resolution takes into account certain concerns
we previously expressed regarding the need to match
the realities on the ground with the human and
material resources needed for the effective operation
of AMISOM.

We therefore call on the members of the Council
and all parties in Somalia to work towards the full
implementation of this resolution, with a view to
restoring lasting peace and stability to Somalia.
