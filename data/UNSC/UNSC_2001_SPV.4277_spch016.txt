Mr. Neewoor (Mauritius): We appreciate the
comprehensive briefing given to us by Mr. Guehenno.

The situation in Kosovo today obviously has not
undergone any significant change since the Council
was last briefed a couple of weeks ago. We note with
concern that violence has continued, the worst case
being the events in Mitrovica in which a number of
United Nations peacekeepers were injured. We need
hardly emphasize that the first and foremost task before
the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in
Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Kosovo Force (KFOR) is to
curb all violence so that the process of peace-building
can proceed.

We commend UNMIK for the comprehensive
plan it is implementing to restore peace and normalcy
in Kosovo. We wish to reiterate that Kosovars' destiny
can only be multi-ethnic coexistence.

We stress that, in the preparations for the
proposed elections, UNMIK must ensure that all ethnic
groups have the opportunity to participate. In that
regard, the opening of an UNMIK office in Belgrade is
extremely important, as it would facilitate the
participation in the elections of Serbs who are at
present constrained from leaving their homes in
Kosovo. It is also important that the legal and
administrative authorities of Kosovo should provide for
the representation of all ethnic groups.

Finally, we urge the Serbian authorities to release
all Albanian prisoners still being held in Serbian
prisons. A general amnesty in that regard can be very
helpful for the establishment of inter-ethnic harmony.

My delegation fully supports the work of UNMIK
for the implementation of resolution 1244 (1999).
