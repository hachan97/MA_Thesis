Mr. Lucas (Angola): We express appreciation for
the efforts of China and the United States in drafting
resolution 2321 (2016), which we have just adopted.
Angolajoined the consensus ofthe Security Council
by voting in favour of resolution 2321 (2016). The text
of the resolution is self-explanatory, and the statements
by Security Council members have expressed our
collective concern about the threat that the nuclear
programme of the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea poses to international peace and security.

We can only appeal to North Korea to abide by
the international community's decisions related to its
nuclear and ballistic missile programmes by negotiating
the end of those programmes under the agreed
framework, concentrating its resources on the social
development of its people, meaningfully contributing
to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, and
thereby to international peace and security, as well as
avoiding becoming an international pariah - a type
of development that may become extremely detrimental
to the people of the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea and an additional danger to peace and security.
