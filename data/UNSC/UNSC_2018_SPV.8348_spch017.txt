Ms. Guadey (Ethiopia): We thank the delegation
of the United Kingdom for requesting this meeting.
We also thank Special Envoy Martin Griffiths for his
briefing. We continue to support his tireless efforts to
facilitate a political solution to the crisis in Yemen and
we commend his diplomatic endeavours to relaunch the
political process after two years.

We know that this will not be an easy task and we
understand the difficulties encountered. Nevertheless,
we agree with the Special Envoy that the Geneva
consultations mark the beginning of the process and we
encourage him to persist in his efforts. We commend
the Yemeni Government for participating in the Geneva
consultations and for engaging constructively with the
Special Envoy on issues related to the peace process,
and particularly on confidence-building measures.

On the other hand, it is regrettable that the Houthis
did not attend the consultations. We understand that the
Special Envoy will be meeting with the representatives
of the Houthis in the coming days, and we hope they
will demonstrate the political commitment necessary
to meaningfully and constructively engage with the
Special Envoy.

At this critical juncture, we believe that the
Council should continue to support the Special Envoy
as he makes every possible effort to fully restart the
political process, which we believe is the only way to
end the suffering of the Yemeni people and to address
the legitimate security concerns of regional actors.
