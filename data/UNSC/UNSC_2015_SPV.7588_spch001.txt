The President: I would like to warmly welcome
the Secretary-General, the Ministers and the other
representatives present in the Security Council
Chamber today. Their presence here underscores the
importance of the subject under discussion today.

In accordance with rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure, I invite the representative
of the Syrian Arab Republic to participate in this
meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its
consisderation of the item on its agenda.

Let me just say to everybody that we have a number
of Ministers who have flight schedules to meet. This
went on a little longer than we had thought, and I
appreciate everybody's patience. We are very grateful
to them.

It is now my honour now to give the floor to the
Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon.
