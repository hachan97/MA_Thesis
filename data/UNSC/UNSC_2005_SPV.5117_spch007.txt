Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
Since its inception, the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) has played an important role in
maintaining stability in the region. We appreciate the
efforts it has undertaken.

In keeping with the Secretary-General's
recommendation, and at the request of the Lebanese
Government, we support the adoption by the Security
Council of a technical resolution to extend UNIFIL's
mandate for a further six months. We are grateful to all
sides for the constructive spirit manifested during the
consultations on the draft resolution.

Even though the text is still not entirely
satisfactory, the Chinese delegation, bearing in mind
the overall situation, voted in favour of the draft
resolution.

We would like to avail ourselves of this
opportunity to appeal once again to the parties
concerned effectively to implement their commitments,
fully respect the Blue Line, exercise the utmost
restraint, and jointly maintain peace and stability along
the borders.

The relationship between Israel and Palestine has

witnessed some improvement. The peace process in the
Middle East is moving in a positive direction. As the
question of Lebanon and Israel is an important part in
the peace process in the Middle East, we hope that both
parties will seize the opportunity to expeditiously
resume their talks on the basis of the relevant Security
Council resolutions and the principle of land for peace,
strive to reach consensus and achieve a comprehensive,
just and durable peace in the Middle East at an early
date.
