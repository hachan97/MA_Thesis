Mr. Wehbe (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): We are moments away from the Council's
adoption of a very important draft resolution. We shall
vote in favour of the draft resolution for reasons of
unanimity and the unity of the Council. We are doing
this with a view to halting Israeli aggression against the
Palestinian people.

We have no intention whatever of transforming
this meeting into an occasion to indulge in rhetoric, as
the Israeli representative would wish. The Syrian
record is well known to all members of the Council and
of the Organization, and that record is an honourable
one. When Syria succeeded in being elected to the
Security Council it was with a majority vote of 160
Members. The members of the Council are well aware
of the considerable contributions made by Syria in
dealing with the various problems before the Council
relating to the maintenance of international peace and
security. I have no need to respond to the allegations
and false claims made by the Israeli representative, and
I do not intend to turn this meeting into a competition
in polemics.
Resolution 425 (1978) has not been implemented
in full. The implementation that has taken place
occurred with resistance. Yet even now there are daily
aerial violations aimed at terrifying the citizens of
Lebanon. When there is resistance to that, everything is
topsy-turvy. We are not here this evening to repeat that
Israel has not implemented all relevant resolutions -
particularly those of the Security Council. We are here
to adopt another draft resolution because Israel has not
implemented the two most recently adopted
resolutions.
