The President: I must remind colleagues that the
time limit for statements is four minutes. Otherwise
we will not be able to get through the list of speakers.
My delegation will pass the speaker a note once they
reach the four-minute stage in case they do not see
the microphone, but then I am afraid that I will have
to interrupt to ensure that we can hear every speaker
on the list this afternoon. I thank all colleagues for
their understanding.

I now give the floor to the representative
of Liechtenstein.
