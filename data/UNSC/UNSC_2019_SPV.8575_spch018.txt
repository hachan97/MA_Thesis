Mr. Mabhongo (South Africa): At the outset, we
wish to thank Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo and
High Commissioner Zannier for their briefings today.

With regard to the matter brought to the attention
of this meeting, South Africa continues to encourage
all the parties to strengthen all diplomatic efforts so as
to avoid an escalation of tensions and work towards an
inclusive, sustainable and peaceful solution based on
cooperation and genuine dialogue. It is also of critical
importance that all the parties refrain from actions that
could be viewed as provocative, which may further
impede a peaceful resolution of the situation.

Non-implementation of existing agreements leads
to unintended consequences. We wish to reiterate the
necessity for all the parties to fully implement all their
respective commitments under the Minsk agreements,
which provide the most promising road map for the
peaceful settlement of the current hostilities, including
in eastern Ukraine, and to advance the cause of peace
and stability in the wider region.

In conclusion, we encourage all parties to approach
dialogue in the spirit of compromise in order to move
the process forward.
