"The Security Council strongly condemns the

Democratic People's Republic of Korea for its
outrageous actions and demands that the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea immediately cease all
such actions. The Security Council stresses that

of Korea are a threat notjust to the region, but to all
United Nations Member States.

"The Security Council expresses its grave
concern that the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea is, by conducting such a launch over Japan
as well as its recent actions and public statements,
deliberately undermining regional peace and

emphasizes the Vital importance of immediate,
concrete actions to reduce tensions in the Korean

13 April 2009 (S/PRST/2009/7) and 16 April 2012
(S/PRST/2012/13), by suspending all activities
related to its ballistic missile programme and in this
context re-establish its pre-existing commitments
to a moratorium on missile launches.

"The Security Council further demands
that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
immediately comply fully with all of its other

in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner,
and immediately cease all related activities; not
conduct any further nuclear tests or any further
provocation; and abandon any other existing
weapons of mass destruction in a complete,
verifiable and irreversible manner.

2094 (2013), 2270 (2016), 2321 (2016), 2356 (2017),
and 2371 (2017).

at large, expresses its commitment to a peaceful,
diplomatic and political solution to the situation,
and welcomes efforts by Council members, as
well as other States, to facilitate a peaceful and
