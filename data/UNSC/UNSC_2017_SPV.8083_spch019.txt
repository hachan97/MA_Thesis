Mr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): As I noted during my statement, there are
more than 1 million Ukrainians in Russia who fled the
area of conflict, as well as an equal number of labour
migrants from that country. Therefore, in spite of the
unrestrained anti-Russian propaganda from Kyiv, those
citizens have taken refuge in Russia to flee war or to
resolve their socioeconomic issues. In our view, that is
the real cost of the mantras of Russian aggression that
we, unfortunately, heard voiced today.
