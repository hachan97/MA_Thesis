Mr. Ladsous (France) (interpretation from French):
I apologize for speaking, but I wish to address the
statement made by the Ambassador of Rwanda that
Belgium and France are pursuing linguistic, economic and
political interests - I believe those are the words he
used - which are contrary to the interests of the
countries of the region.

It is not my habit to address such gratuitously
unpleasant comments as those made by the Ambassador
of Rwanda, but I believe that for once I am obliged to do
so. His statement is clearly contrary to the logic of the
actions of my country, which, I recall was among the first
to renew diplomatic relations with Rwanda after last
year's crisis and one of the first to redevelop cooperation
with its Government.

But what does it really matter now? All this is trivial
and has nothing whatever to do with the goal of this
meeting, which is to demonstrate that we are waiting for
the facts to be established and the truth to be ascertained.
More generally, as I said in my earlier statement, the
restoration of peace in the Great Lakes region is indeed
the result we are all pursuing. I wish to make that
perfectly clear.
