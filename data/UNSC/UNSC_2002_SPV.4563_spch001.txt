The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany
and Italy, in which they request to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In accordance with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, MrKusljugic'
(Bosnia and Herzegovina) took a seat at the
Council table.

The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (8/2002/618).
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2002/712, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Bulgaria, France,
Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, the Russian
Federation and the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements before the voting.
