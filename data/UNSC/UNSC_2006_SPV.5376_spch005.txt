Mr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese):
Let me at the outset thank the Secretariat for its
briefing.

The Chinese delegation would like to make three
preliminary comments.
First, peacekeeping operations are one of the
most effective measures used by the United Nations to
maintain peace and achieving collective security. In
recent years, due to the ever-increasing new mandates,
requirements for peacekeeping funds have been on the
rise. Peacekeeping assessments have exceeded the
regular budget of the United Nations. Therefore,
greater attention is naturally being paid by all sides to
the use and management of peacekeeping funds.

With regard to the problems related to
peacekeeping procurement that have come to light,
China hopes that the Secretariat will carefully look into
cases that involve violations of rules and regulations
and take stern disciplinary action. At the same time,
lessons should be learned so as to effectively improve
the management system, intensify oversight, and
forestall any recurrences of such cases.

Secondly, China has noted that the Office of
Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) has completed its
consolidated evaluation report, but that relevant
investigations are still going on. We hope that, upon
completion of the investigations, the Secretariat will
submit a timely report on the findings and the handling
of the cases.

Thirdly, regarding the deployment, extension and
conclusion of peacekeeping operations and the defining
of their mandates and scale, the Security Council is in
duty bound to assume primary responsibility in that
regard. However, issues involving the use of
peacekeeping funds in procurement management
should preferably be referred to the General Assembly
and its subsidiary organs, in keeping with the principle
of division of labour among United Nations bodies.
That would help all entities to play their proper roles,
prevent duplication and facilitate mutual oversight.
