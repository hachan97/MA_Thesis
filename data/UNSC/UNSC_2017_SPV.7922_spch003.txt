Mr. Safronkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I would like to inform the members of
the Security Council that during the course of the
negotiations that took place today in Moscow between
the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian
Federation, Mr. Lavrov, and the Secretary of State of
the United States, Mr. Tillerson, we proposed to the
American side that we send a joint statement to the
Director-General of the Technical Secretariat of the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
(OPCW), Mr. Uziimcii, asking him to immediately put
together an independent international mission for a Visit
to Khan Shaykhun, where it is alleged that chemical
agents were used, and to the Shayrat air base. The United
States Secretary of State is considering that proposal,
and we expect that Washington, DC, will offer it a
constructive response, given the current situation.

Given what I have just said and the fact that
tomorrow, on 13 April there will be a meeting of the
Executive Council of the OPCW in The Hague, where
all ofthese issues will be discussed, we feel that putting
the draft resolution to a vote today does not serve a
useful purpose.
