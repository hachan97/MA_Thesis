The President: I thank the representative of Croatia
for his kind words addressed to me. I invite him to
resume the seat reserved for him at the side of the
Council Chamber.

In accordance with the decision taken earlier in the
meeting, I now invite Ambassador Dragomir Djokic to
take a place at the Council table and to make a statement.
