The President: I thank Mr. Lacroix for his briefing.
I also thank him for his leadership and time. We look
forward to working with him.

Before calling on speakers, I should like on behalf
of us all, extend our condolences to France for the
soldier who was lost in Mali yesterday. We know the
sacrifices our military make when they do this work,
and our hearts and prayers are with the people of
France today.

I now give the floor to those Council members who
wish to make statements.
