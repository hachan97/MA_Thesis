Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): It is no secret to Council members that the idea
of discussing the situation regarding the forthcoming
elections in eastern Ukraine on 11 November came from
six delegations - Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland,
the United Kingdom, the United States and France.
However, it occurred to none of them to invite the the
people that the meeting is about, the representatives of
the area, to participate in it. Furthermore, its initiators
proposed holding it as a closed meeting so that they
could then report to the media only on the elements that
they wanted to.

We have long been familiar with these ways of
working in the Security Council, and we condemn
such blatant examples of double standards. For reasons
of transparency, therefore, we insisted on a public
meeting and requested the participation of the heads
of the central electoral commissions of the Donetsk
and Luhansk People's Republics. We hope that the
members of the Council are just as interested as we
are in receiving complete information on the true state
of affairs in Ukraine. We call on them not to submit
to these delegations' pressure or to obstruct a briefing
to the Council by the representative of the Donetsk
and Luhansk People's Republics and parties to the
Minsk agreements.
