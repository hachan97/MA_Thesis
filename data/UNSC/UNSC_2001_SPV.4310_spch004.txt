Mr. Jerandi (Tunisia) (spoke in French): I, too,
would like to thank Mr. Guehenno for his very
important briefing to us and, above all, for the good
news he has just announced, in particular regarding the
signing by the two parties yesterday of the agreement
establishing the Temporary Security Zone.

We believe that, as the two parties have already
reached agreement, they should focus their efforts on
the implementation of the final, decisive stage of the
peace process: the delimitation and demarcation of the
borders. In this context, we would like to encourage the
Governments of the two parties to redouble their
efforts to finalize arrangements for the establishment of
the Boundary Commission, in accordance with the
provisions of the peace Agreement of 12 December and
the Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities, so as to
enable the process of demarcation and delimitation of
borders to begin.

Furthermore, we earnestly encourage the two
parties to continue to cooperate fully with the United
Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE), in
particular in the area of demining, a subject about
which Mr. Guehenno provided so much detail. The
question of the demining of the border zone is of
pivotal importance, and we would like to know
whether UNMEE has available all the necessary maps
showing the location of the landmines so that they can
be removed, thereby enabling displaced persons to
return to those areas before the beginning of the rainy
season.

Of course, we cannot fail to pay tribute to
UNMEE for the outstanding efficiency that it has
demonstrated in carrying out its mandate.
