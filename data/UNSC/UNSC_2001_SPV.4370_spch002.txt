The Secretary-General: We meet, as you have
said, Sir, in exceptionally grave circumstances. Our
host country and this host city have been subjected to a
terrorist attack which horrifies us all. We do not yet
know the full extent of the damage, but it seems certain
that thousands of people have lost their lives and that
many have suffered dreadful injuries.

All of us feel deep shock and revulsion at the
cold-blooded viciousness of this attack. All of us
condemn it and those who planned it - whoever they
may be - in the strongest possible terms. All of us, I
am sure, extend our most profound sympathy to the
victims, to their loved ones and to the people and
Government of the United States.

More than that, we must express our solidarity
with the American Government and people in this hour
of trial.

Terrorism is an international scourge which the
United Nations has many times condemned. A terrorist
attack on one country is an attack on humanity as a
whole. All nations of the world must work together to
identify the perpetrators and bring them to justice.
