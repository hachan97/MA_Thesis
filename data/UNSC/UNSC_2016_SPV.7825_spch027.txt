Ms. Sison (United States ofAmerica): As the origin
of the Syrian crisis has been raised by others who just
took the floor, in March 2011 protests against Bashar
Al-Assad began in Syria. He responded with brutal
violence, which dramatically escalated the situation,
and then relied upon others to support him. The United
Nations responded with numerous resolutions and
communiques, which all start with a ceasefire, and
that is what we tried to do today. Any allegations to
the contrary about the United States on this matter
are absurd.
