The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now make
a statement in my national capacity.

We would like to thank Mr. Thomas Markram,
Deputy to the High Representative for Disarmament
Affairs, for his briefing. Peru notes with alarm the
repeated reports of the use of chemical weapons
against the civilian population in Syria and the
absence of a commitment to accountability. Those
are heinous crimes, committed in open defiance of
the non-proliferation regime and a serious threat to
international peace and security, which the Council
cannot allow.

In our view, the destruction of the last two
declared chemical-weapons production facilities in
Syria is an important step. We welcome the meeting
held in Beirut by representatives of the Organization
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW),
the United Nations Office for Project Services and
the Syrian Government, which will contribute to that
end. However, we are concerned to see, once again, the
continuing discrepancies in the Syrian Government's
declaration, more than four years after its accession
to the Chemical Weapons Convention. We must urge
the Syrian authorities to provide all the information
required, without further delay.

We would also like to reiterate our support for the
professional and objective work of the OPCW Fact-
finding Mission and pay tribute to its staff. We stress
that its work must be complemented by an independent
mechanism that, within the framework of due process,
allows for the attribution of responsibilities in this
case, in line with international law and international
humanitarian law.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

I would like to remind all speakers to keep their
statements within the time limits provided for in the
note by the President of Security Council (S/2017/507).

I now give the floor to the representative of the
Syrian Arab Republic.
