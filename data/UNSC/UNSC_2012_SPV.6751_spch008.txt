Mr. Osorio (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): The
Security Council's message today is, first and
foremost, a call to the Syrian Government to cease its
violence and the unfettered repression of its people,
which has jeopardized peace and security in a region
that is already experiencing an extremely fragile
situation. The world has watched with the
unprecedented violence with horror; the authorities
there are responsible for enormous levels of death and
torture and violations of every human right.

Finally, after more than a year of such atrocities,
the Council has adopted a resolution (resolution 2042 (2012)) that seeks to end the violence and bring about
political dialogue. The basis for that dialogue has been
established by the Joint Special Envoy of the United
Nations and the League of Arab States, Mr. Kofi
Annan. We believe that his management and efforts
deserve our full support and gratitude. The presence of
a United Nations mission will require the full backing
and participation of the Government of Syria. That is
what we are seeking and what we hope will be
achieved.
