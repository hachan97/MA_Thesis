Mr. Danforth (United States of America): I had
not intended to speak further until, unfortunately, the
representative of the Sudan strayed from the point of
our deliberations and launched what we would consider
to be an unseemly and uncalled-for attack on the
United States: an attack which was totally off the point
that is now before the Security Council.

The point before the Security Council, once
again, is to protect the people of Darfur, who have been
suffering terribly and in a way that is unique in the
tragedies of the world today: suffering from armed
attacks by militias, but also directly by the Government
of the Sudan; suffering from attacks after the
Government of the Sudan reached a ceasefire
agreement, after the Government of the Sudan issued
the joint communique with the Secretary-General
relating to commitments on disarming the Janjaweed,
and after the Security Council adopted resolution 1556
(2004) - attacks involving helicopters, shooting into
civilian villages.

That is the issue that is before the Security
Council. It does not have anything to do with the
broadside just launched by the representative of the
Sudan against the United States.
