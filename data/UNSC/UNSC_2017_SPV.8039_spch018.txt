The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as the representative of Ethiopia.

We believe that the situation surrounding the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea is becoming
progressively more complex and increasingly fraught
with incalculable danger, not only for the Korean
peninsula but for global peace and security as a whole.

The latest nuclear test by the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea is indeed a dangerous escalation,
with potentially catastrophic consequences. We join
all Council members in condemning it in the strongest
possible terms. This latest provocation by the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea came only a few days after
we adopted presidential statement S/PRST/2017/16,
which calls on it to abandon all nuclear weapons and
to immediately cease all related activities, while also
underscoring the need for a peaceful diplomatic and
political solution to the situation.

There have indeed been overtures in that direction,
but they have not been seized. Without any doubt,
the recent nuclear tests by the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea clearly indicate that we might be at
the edge of a cliff. We agree with all Council members
that we are in a very dangerous phase of this problem.
We believe that the Council should use all means at its
disposal to bring the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea back to the negotiating table, and we are open to
proposals that could be considered in that regard.

We hope that we will be able to take appropriate
action to bring pressure to bear on the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea, while maintaining the
unity of the Council on this very delicate issue, which
has far-reaching implications for peace and security on
the Korean peninsula and beyond. We attach extremely
great importance to the unity of the Council on
this matter.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

I give the floor to the representative ofthe Republic
of Korea.
