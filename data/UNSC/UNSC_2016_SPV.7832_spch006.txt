The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now make
a brief statement in my national capacity.

We are approaching the first anniversary of the
Skhirat Agreement without any significant progress
having been made. The stalemate in the situation in
Libya is a threat to the security of Libya and of the
broader region. I recall that the Political Agreement
is the outcome of the work conducted by the United
Nations with the Libyans themselves, and several urgent
challenges must be met. The first is the establishment
of a Government of National Accord, supported by the
House of Representatives. The second is the smooth
functioning of the country's financial institutions. And
the third is the unification of armed forces under the
authority of the executive. That is why we supported

extending the mandate of the United Nations Support
Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) and the efforts of Special
Representative Kobler. We hope that with this extension
of UNSMIL'S mandate, the situation in Libya will be
markedly different.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

The meeting rose at 10.15 am.
