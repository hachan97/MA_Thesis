Mr. Brahimi: At the end of this debate, I think
that it is my duty to express deep appreciation to you,
Madam, to His Excellency the Foreign Minister of
Jamaica and to the other honourable Foreign Ministers
and representatives, who took time to attend and
participate in this open debate of the Council on
Afghanistan. I am truly grateful to you, Madam
President, and to them for the kind words of support
and encouragement you all had for the Secretary-
General and for myself. The Secretary-General and all
of us who work with him on this delicate issue are
heartened and encouraged by your support. What is
more important, the message that is going out from the
Council to the world will be received by the people of
Afghanistan as a most welcome and desperately needed
message of solidarity and hope.
