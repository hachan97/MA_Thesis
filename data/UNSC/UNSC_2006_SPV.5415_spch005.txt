The President (spoke in Chinese): I thank the
Minister of Defence of Uganda for his statement and
for the kind words he addressed to my country

Council for this month.

In accordance with the understanding reached in
the Council's prior consultations, I shall now invite
Council members to a private meeting to continue our
discussion on the subject.
