Ms. Chan: Thank you very much for the
invitation to brief the Security Council. This is the first
opportunity for the World Health Organization (WHO)
to do so. We are very pleased to have had this
opportunity, and especially to have been able to listen
to the views of the members of the Security Council
and their advice.

I would like to make one point. I fully agree with
the comments of many of the Council members on the
importance of United Nations agencies' working
together, based on their areas of core competency, to
support countries and the international community in
mounting a highly effective and integrated approach, as
the President said, to any threat to world peace and
28
security. The World Health Organization is not a major
player in peace and security and does not deal with
those issues directly, but if there is anything we can do
to support the work of the Council, we would be happy
to contribute. I thank you once again for this
opportunity.
