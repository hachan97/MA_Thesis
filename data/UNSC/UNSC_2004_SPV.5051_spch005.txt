Mr. Sardenberg (Brazil): Brazil voted in favour
of the draft resolution on the situation in the Middle
East on which the Security Council has just taken
action.

The Brazilian Government strongly deplores the
acts of violence carried out on the northern border of
the Gaza Strip, in particular the offensive conducted by
Israeli military forces during the operation code-named
"Days of Penitence", which began on 29 September
and has resulted in more than 70 casualties and more
than 250 wounded.

It is greatly distressing that the escalation of
violent acts has affected a large number of civilians,
including children. While expressing our support for
the call for a ceasefire, made by the Secretary-General
in his note dated 3 October, our delegation hopes that,
with the engagement of the international community,
the parties involved in the conflict will halt the spiral
of violence so as to enable a resumption, as soon as
possible, of peace talks, in accordance with the
parameters established by the road map.

We recall that the plan foresaw the creation, in
2005, of a Palestinian State - one that is sovereign,
independent, contiguous and economically viable.
