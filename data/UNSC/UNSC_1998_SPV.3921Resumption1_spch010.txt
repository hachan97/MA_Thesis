Mr. Buallay (Bahrain) (interpretation from Arabic):
My delegation has stressed on many previous occasions
the need to resolve the Afghan crisis through dialogue,
peaceful means and direct negotiations between all
Afghan factions. Escalation, hostilities and resort to force
are not the means to resolve that crisis. In this context,
we call on all Afghan factions to cease hostilities, to
return to the negotiating table and to cooperate in order to
reach a comprehensive solution and a durable peace in
Afghanistan. We also call on the international community
and the States with influence in Afghanistan to intensify
their efforts, in cooperation with the United Nations, in
order to help the parties reach a peaceful settlement
through negotiation.

My delegation reaffirms its full support for the
efforts made by the United Nations - as represented by
the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General in
Afghanistan - as well as for the activities of the United
Nations Special Mission in Afghanistan, to facilitate the
peace process aimed at obtaining the objectives of
national reconciliation and a durable settlement in
Afghanistan.

In this context, my delegation appeals to all States,
the programmes and specialized agencies of the United
Nations and other international organizations to resume
providing humanitarian assistance to all those in need in
Afghanistan as soon as security conditions permit. We
affirm the need to guarantee the safety and security of the
personnel of international organizations working for the
Afghan people and for peace in the country.

Proceeding from the State of Bahrain's belief in the
need to settle political crises through dialogue, direct
negotiations and refraining from military force - which
can only increase tensions - my delegation will support
the draft resolution before the Council today, with the
understanding that the interpretation of the last
preambular paragraph and the operative paragraph 14
does not prejudice Islamic shariah.
