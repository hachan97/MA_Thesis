Mr. Gimolieca (Angola): I thank Prosecutor Fatou
Bensouda for her report.

As a member of the African Union (AU), Angola
reiterates its commitment to the fight against impunity,
in accordance with the Constitutive Act of the African
Union, and aligns itselfwith the African Union decision
on the International Criminal Court, adopted at the
Kigali Summit in July.

We welcome the activities of the Office of the
Prosecutor related to monitoring and investigating
crimes. However, we do not welcome the fact that
a whole chapter of the report is based on allegations
and reports from that source, and is not based on
investigations conducted by the Court. Some of those
allegations have been challenged by the Government
of the Sudan, and have not been confirmed by the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations. That can
potentially affect the report's credibility.

Angola will uphold the position of the African
Union on that issue, while advocating for dialogue as
the only solution to adverse political disputes in Darfur,
the Sudan, Africa and all over the world.
