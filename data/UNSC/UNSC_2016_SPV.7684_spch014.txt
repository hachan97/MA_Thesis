Mr. Seck (Senegal) (spoke in French): With
Senegal's vote in favour, the Security Council has
just adopted resolution 2285 (2016), renewing for a
period of 12 months the mandate of the United Nations
Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, which
was to expire tomorrow on 30 April. It is assuredly a
balanced resolution, for which the delegation of Senegal
would like to commend the leadership demonstrated
by the United States of America in conducting the
consultations. It is the result of the constructive spirit
with which the members of the Council participated in
the process, allowing for the achievement of a text this
morning that entertains hope with regard to the political
process, the only way to resolve the issue.

Bearing in mind the important role played by the
United Nations in that process, as well as the equally
constructive stance taken by Morocco, I would like
pay tribute to them and encourage all efforts being
made to enhance cooperation between the Secretariat
and the Kingdom of Morocco. The dialogue was never
broken between the parties, thanks, in particular, to
the discrete diplomacy that has been deployed, as well
as the bilateral contacts. The delegation of Senegal
therefore takes this opportunity to highlight that the
self-governance that Morocco has been proposing since
2007 appears to be positive, serious and realistic. It
can encourage the pursuit of a climate of cooperation
between the parties for a just, long-lasting and mutually
acceptable solution in conformity with the Charter of
the United Nations.
