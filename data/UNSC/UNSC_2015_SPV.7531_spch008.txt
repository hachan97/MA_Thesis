Mr. Delattre (France) (spoke in French): France
fully supports and co-sponsored resolution 2240
(2015), which was adopted today as the fruit of close
cooperation between the four European members of
the Security Council and their other partners in the
Council. The resolution aims to give the member States
of the European Union the necessary legal guarantees
to enable them to successfully conduct the operations
provided for within the framework of phase 2-A of the
European Union military operation in the southern
Central Mediterranean, Operation Sophia, which has
been in place since 7 October and provides for inspection
and, where necessary, stop and search on the high seas
of vessels and boats used in the trafficking of migrants.
We have made sure that the text precisely defines the
circumstances in which the recourse to force would be
authorized to combat resistance by traffickers, and have
included robust guarantees that protect the rights of
migrants and refugees who might be passengers on such
vessels. We consider it more urgent than ever to craft a
comprehensive response to the migratory crisis in the
Mediterranean and the tragic situations it engenders,
with which we are all familiar. The resolution is part of
that response; others must follow.

We are convinced that the Council cannot remain
silent in the face of the present tragic situation in the
Mediterranean.
