The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

document S/2009/647, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Austria, Burkina Faso,
Croatia, France, Japan, Mexico, Turkey, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and
United States of America.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Austria, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, Japan, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,
Mexico, Russian Federation, Turkey, Uganda,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, United States of America, Viet Nam

The President (spoke in French): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1904 (2009).

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements after the voting.
