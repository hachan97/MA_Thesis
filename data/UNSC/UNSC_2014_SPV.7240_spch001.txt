The President: The Security Council will now

begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

Following consultations among Council members,

I have been authorized to make the following statement
on their behalf.

"The Security Council expresses grave
alarm and concern regarding the substantial
deterioration of the political and security situation
and developing humanitarian catastrophe in South
Sudan resulting from the internal Sudan People's
Liberation Movement (SPLM) political dispute and
unrelenting violence, including against civilians,
caused by the country's political and military
leaders since 15 December 2013.

"The Security Council strongly condemns the
repeated violations of the Cessation of Hostilities
Agreement accepted and signed by the Republic of
South Sudan and the SPLM/A (in Opposition) on
23 January 2014, and emphasizes that the actions
of President Salva Kiir and former Vice-President
Riek Machar in continuing to pursue a military
solution to this conflict are unacceptable.

"The Security Council urgently calls upon
President Salva Kiir, former Vice-President Riek
Machar and all parties to implement the agreement
to resolve the crisis in South Sudan signed on
9 May 2014 by the Republic of South Sudan and
the SPLM/A (in Opposition), to engage fully
and inclusively in ongoing peace talks in Addis
Ababa, and uphold their commitment to establish
a transitional Government of national unity by
the deadline of 10 August 2014, and in this regard
strongly appeals to the parties to finalize appropriate
arrangements without further delay, and expresses
its readiness to consider, in consultations with
relevant partners, including the Intergovernmental
Authority on Development (IGAD) and the African
Union (AU), all appropriate measures, including
targeted sanctions, against those who take action
that undermines the peace, stability and security

of South Sudan, including those who prevent the
implementation of these agreements.
"The Security Council strongly condemns
reported and ongoing human rights violations and
abuses and violations of international humanitarian
law, including those involving extrajudicial
killings, ethnically targeted violence, sexual and
gender-based violence, rape, recruitment and use
of children, enforced disappearances, arbitrary
arrests and detention, violence aimed at spreading
terror among the civilian population, and attacks
on schools and hospitals, as well as United Nations
peacekeeping personnel, by all parties, including
armed groups and national security forces. The
Security Council recalls that such acts may amount
to war crimes or crimes against humanity under
international law.

"The Security Council emphasizes the need
to ensure accountability for serious violations and
abuses of human rights and serious violations of
international humanitarian law. In that regard, the
Security Council underscores the importance of the
ongoing work of the AU commission of inquiry and
looks forward to its findings and recommendations,
and welcomes United Nations Mission in South
Sudan efforts to continue to monitor, investigate
and publicly report on human rights violations and
abuses in pursuit of justice and an end to impunity,
as set out in resolution 2155 (2014).

"The Security Council underscores its grave
concern about the catastrophic food insecurity
situation in South Sudan that may soon reach the
threshold of famine as a result of continued conflict,
civilian targeting and displacement, stresses the
responsibility borne by all parties to the conflict
for the suffering of the people of South Sudan and
the necessity of ensuring that the basic needs of the
population are met, underscores the urgent need
to increase funding for humanitarian operations
in South Sudan, and encourages United Nations
Member States to contribute funds critically needed
now to provide life-saving assistance.

"The Security Council condemns all attacks
against humanitarian personnel and facilities,
commends United Nations humanitarian agencies
and partners for their efforts to provide urgent
and coordinated support to the population and
calls upon all parties to the conflict to allow and
facilitate, in accordance with relevant provisions
of international law and United Nations guiding
principles of humanitarian assistance, the full,
safe and unhindered access of relief personnel,
equipment and supplies to all those in need and
timely delivery of humanitarian assistance, in
particular to internally displaced persons and
refugees.

"The Security Council renews its deep
appreciation for the actions taken by United Nations
Mission in South Sudan personnel and troop- and
police-contributing countries to protect tens of
thousands of civilians under threat of physical
violence and to stabilize the security situation.

"The Security Council commends IGAD, as
supported by the United Nations and the African
Union, for its relentless work in establishing a forum
for political and security dialogue, establishing and
operationalizing the Monitoring and Verification
Mechanism for the Cessation of Hostilities
Agreement and leading multi-stakeholder political
negotiations to establish a transitional Government
of national unity."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2014/16.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 11.50 am.
