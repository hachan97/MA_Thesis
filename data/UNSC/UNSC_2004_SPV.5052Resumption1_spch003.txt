The President: I thank Mr. Malloch Brown for
his statement.

Moving forward, in order to optimize our time, I
will not individually invite speakers to take seats at the
Council table and then to resume their seats at the side
of the Council Chamber. When a speaker is taking the
floor, the Conference Officer will seat the next speaker
on the list at the table.

I now give the floor to the representative of the
Netherlands.
