The President (spoke in Russian): The next
speaker on my list is the representative of the
Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of
the Palestinian People, Mr. Louis Papa Fall, to whom
the Council extended an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure. I invite him to take a
seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
