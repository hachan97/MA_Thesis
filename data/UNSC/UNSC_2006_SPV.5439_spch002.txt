Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): In the light of the position of the African
Union set out in the communique of its Peace and
Security Council of 15 May, which we share, the
Russian Federation supported the resolution just
adopted, which endorses African efforts to achieve a
peaceful settlement in Darfur.

However, we continue to believe that the
reference in the resolution to Chapter VII of the United
Nations Charter neither alters the character of the
Security Council's decisions on the Sudan nor
predetermines the mandate of the future United
Nations peacekeeping presence in Darfur, to be
established in the light of all relevant factors and
dynamics of the situation in that Sudanese province
and in the Sudan as a whole.

It is also important that further steps to establish
a United Nations peacekeeping presence in Darfur be
agreed with the Government of the Sudan.

The Russian Federation will continue to lend
every possible assistance to reinforcing a political
settlement in Darfur, in the interests of the unity and
territorial integrity of the Sudan and the consolidation
of peace and security in the region.
