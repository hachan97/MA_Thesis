The President (spoke in French): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as representative of
Belgium.

Belgium would like to express its grave concern
at the tension prevailing in South Ossetia, Georgia.
This tension has already led to the loss of many lives
and to a large number of injuries. In the face of this
very worrying deterioration of the situation in the
region, Belgium calls upon all parties concerned to put
an end to military operations and to demonstrate
moderation. Belgium calls upon the parties to accept an
immediate and unconditional ceasefire and to work,
with the help of international community, for a rapid
resumption of dialogue.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council. I give the floor to the representative of the
Russian Federation.
