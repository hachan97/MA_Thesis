Mr. Li Baodong (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China voted in favour of resolution 1984 (2011), which
extends the mandate of the Panel of Experts of the
Committee established pursuant to resolution 1737
(2006). As a component of the Council's Iranian
sanctions regime, the Panel shall work in strict
accordance with the mandate established by resolution
1929 (2010) under the direction of the Committee and
the principles of impartiality, objectivity and
independence.

The resolution just adopted further emphasizes
those principles and requirements, as well as the
importance of credible, fact-based, independent
assessments, analysis and recommendations, in
accordance with the Panel of Experts' mandate. It
requests the Panel to provide to the Committee a
planned programme of work and to heed the opinions
of the Committee concerning the midterm and final
reports it provides to the Council, in an effort to
enhance its communications with the Committee.

China hopes that the Panel will adhere strictly to
these principles and requirements and play its due role
in promoting the comprehensive and effective
implementation of the relevant resolutions of the
Council.
