Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria) (spoke in French): I
would like to join previous speakers in thanking Mr.
Lubbers for his comprehensive and exhaustive briefing
on the situation of refugee populations throughout the
world. I would like to say a few words about the
difficulties encountered by the High Commissioner and
the humanitarian community in dealing with such
populations flows.

Could Mr. Lubbers give us some information on
the financial problems caused by these emergency
situations? In that connection, I would like to say a few
words about the specific situation of refugee-receiving
States, which, as is well known, are mostly developing
countries. They usually spare no effort in providing
hospitality, yet, in most cases, their national
development efforts are hampered and their resources
absorbed by their duty of hospitality vis-a-vis the
refugee populations. In that respect, I am thinking of
the problem of cost-sharing. I would like to ask Mr.
Lubbers to say a few words about what should
probably be done to alleviate the burden on receiving
States.

A second point that Mr. Lubbers' briefing
prompts me to make relates to the considerable
contribution that the Office of the High Commissioner
has made towards improving the political climate of
those conflicts in which he is involved, with a view to
promoting the return of refugees.

I would like to point out that we are dealing with
two distinct types of refugees situations: situations that
are heavily covered in the media or emergency
situations that require the mobilization of resources; and
those that we call the forgotten conflicts, which can
persist for reasons that, in my view, are worth
identifying in a debate such as this - political reasons
that can prolong the dependency of populations for
decades. My delegation would highly appreciate hearing
Mr. Lubbers's comments on forgotten conflicts.
