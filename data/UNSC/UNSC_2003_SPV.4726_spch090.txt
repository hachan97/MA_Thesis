The President (spoke in French): We had about
78 speakers on our list; 45 have spoken this afternoon.
There are still 33 left. Because of the lateness of the
hour, with the concurrence of the members of the
Council, I propose that I suspend the meeting until
tomorrow at 9.30 am. I would be grateful to those
speakers who will take the floor tomorrow to heed the
appeal I made about the length of time for speaking. It
should be limited to five minutes.

The meeting was suspended at 8.35 pm.
