The President (interpretation from Arabic): I thank
the representative of India for his kind words addressed
to me.

I thank the representatives of States who have made
statements. I believe that the number of speakers, both in
the formal meeting held on Wednesday, 16 December,
and today, reflects the great attention that is given to the
subject of the close and logical links between
peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building.

Many good ideas have been put forward. I hope that
the Security Council will benefit from such views when
taking its decisions relating to international peace and
security.

The Security Council will take whatever action it
deems necessary in its decision-making to translate such
ideas into concrete actions.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my list.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage

of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 6.35 pm.
