The President (spoke in Chinese): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as representative of
China.

I thank Ambassador Osorio for briefing the
Council on the most recent 90-day programme of work
of the Committee established pursuant to resolution
1737 (2006). I believe that, under his outstanding
leadership and with his effective coordinating skills,
the Committee will advance its work in a balanced and
orderly manner. China attaches great importance to the
work of the Committee and will, as always, support it.

Negotiation and dialogue are the appropriate
avenue for addressing Iran's nuclear issue. Since
December 2010, the six, the European Union and Iran
have held two rounds of talks in which we confirmed
the basic approach of engaging in dialogue in the
interests of cooperation and finding common ground,
and expressed our readiness for continued dialogue. At
the recent meeting of the Board of Governors of the
International Atomic Energy Agency, the six also
reaffirmed their common position of pursuing
engagement with Iran on the basis of reciprocity and a
phased approach and of establishing a cooperative
relationship with Iran in various fields.

As a State party to the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Iran is entitled
to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. At the same time,
it should also fulfil its relevant international
obligations. We hope that Iran will take measures to
enhance the international community's confidence in
the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme.

China believes that, so long as all sides remain
patient, flexible and pragmatic and take practical
measures to enhance mutual confidence, dialogue and
negotiation will make headway. China will continue to
work with all sides in this respect and play a
constructive role in this process.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

I give the floor to Ambassador Osorio to respond
to comments made and questions raised.
