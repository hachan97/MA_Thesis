Mr. Dabbashi (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in Arabic): My delegation voted in favour of the
resolution that has just been adopted. We wish to
reaffirm our full support for the Government and the
people of Afghanistan in their efforts to bring peace
and security to their country. We hope that the adoption
of this resolution will assist them in achieving that
goal.

However, my country would like to express its
concern at the rising number of civilian casualties in
Afghanistan as a result of operations carried out by the
multinational forces. In that regard, we wish to
reiterate that combating terrorism in no way justifies
the killing of civilians. During their operations, the
multinational forces must make every effort to ensure
that Afghan civilians are adequately protected and that
the human rights of the Afghan people are protected
and guaranteed. Those arrested must be given fair trials
and must be held in conditions that are in accordance
with international humanitarian law and human rights
principles.

The use of force alone cannot achieve peace and
security in Afghanistan, which requires a
comprehensive dialogue aimed at national
reconciliation among all factions of the Afghan people
without exception.
