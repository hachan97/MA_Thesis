Mr. Dang (Viet Nam): Viet Nam voted in favour of resolution 2542 (2020), in support of the renewal of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) at this crucial junction in the country's history. We reiterate Viet Nam's consistent position that an inclusive Libyan-led, Libyan-owned peace process is the only viable solution to the current conflict. We would like to reaffirm Viet Nam's full support for the work of UNSMIL and we look forward to the timely appointment of the Special Envoy on Libya as mentioned in resolution just adopted to better facilitate the current peace process. Collaboration among UNSMIL, regional organizations, countries of the region, especially Libya's neighbours, and other relevant States Members of the United Nations will also play a key role in promoting peace and stability in the country. In this regard, we welcome the intra-Libya dialogue held on 6 September in Bouznika, in the Kingdom of Morocco. We compliment the three-track peace talks under the auspices of UNSMIL.
