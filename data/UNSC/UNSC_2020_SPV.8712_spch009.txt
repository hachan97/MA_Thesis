Mrs. Van Vlierberge (Belgium) (spoke in French): Belgium today provided its support for the renewal of the sanctions regime. We would like to thank France for its constructive work and leadership in that regard. Belgium is convinced that the arms embargo measures on the Central African Republic remain essential in order to create the conditions for lasting peace in the country. We recall that the authorities also benefit from an exemptions mechanism. We encourage the authorities to continue their security sector reform efforts so as to ensure that they have well-trained and adequately equipped armed forces and police who are aware of their responsibilities to the people and supported by a long-term strategy. That is a long-term task, and we are ready to assist the Central African Republic as a partner at the national level as well as through the European Union. I would like to conclude by recalling Belgium's support for the Government of President Touadera, Special Representative Ndiaye and the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic.
