Mr. Faaborg-Andersen (Denmark): Denmark
was a sponsor of and voted in favour of resolution
1706 (2006). We did so because, as we have heard over
the past couple of days, the situation in Darfur is
quickly deteriorating. People are dying every day, and
the Council has a responsibility to act. The resolution
proposes a dual-track approach: immediate support for
the African Union Mission in the Sudan (AMIS) in
order to make it better able to fulfil its mandate, and
simultaneous preparation of a United Nations takeover
from AMIS, and a time frame for that. That
comprehensive dual-track approach corresponds to the
wishes of the African Union and gives all parties a
sound basis on which to plan.

Nobody disputes that a United Nations force in
Darfur can be deployed only with the consent of the
Government of the Sudan, and there is absolutely
nothing in the resolution that precludes further
dialogue with the Government of the Sudan on this
issue. Indeed, we hope that efforts will be stepped up
to intensify the dialogue with the Government of
National Unity to persuade it to accept such a transfer.
The fact that the Government of the Sudan has not yet
given its consent could not, however, be a reason to
postpone the adoption of this very necessary
resolution, because that would have meant delaying the
very necessary support to AMIS, which can potentially
save lives in Darfur.

We hope that all efforts will now be concentrated
on the quick implementation of this resolution, to the
benefit of the people of Darfur.
