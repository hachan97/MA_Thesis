Mr. Kasse (Mali) (spoke in French): Thank you,
Madam President, for having organized this interactive
debate with Mr. Oshima, whom we thank for his
briefing. We have taken due note of the progress being
made on the important issue of protecting civilians in
armed conflict.

Through you, Madam, I would like to ask a
question of Mr. Oshima and to make a comment. My
question is, How can regional organizations that are
involved in the protection of civilians - because of
conflicts that are tearing apart their regions - be better
involved, when the time comes, in the mechanism that
is being decided on right now?

My comment is that we would have wished, like
others who have evoked the participation of Security
Council members, that regional organizations that are
confronting conflict should be invited to participate in
the workshops. We would be grateful to Mr. Oshima if
he could give us written conclusions and
recommendations on the work of the workshops that he
referred to.
