Mr. Cai Weiming (China) (spoke in Chinese):
I would like to thank Prosecutor Bensouda for her
briefing. We have seen no major changes in the Darfur
situation recently. We support the ongoing efforts of
the Government of the Sudan to advance the political
reconciliation process, and we welcome the joint efforts
of the Government of the Sudan and some rebel groups
concerned to promote the implementation of the Doha
Document for Peace in Darfur. We appreciate the fact
that the African Union High-level Implementation
Panel and the African Union-United Nations Hybrid
Operation in Darfur have facilitated the holding of
negotiations in Ethiopia between the Government of the
Sudan and the Darfur rebels concerned. We hope that
the parties will demonstrate pragmatism and try to find
common ground towards a comprehensive political
solution to the Darfur issue.

The issue of Darfur is multifaceted and complex.
China has always believed that a fundamental basis
for work in other areas, such as promoting justice, can
be established only by promoting steady progress in
the political process. The overall goal is to achieve a
comprehensive solution to the Darfur issue.

The position of China concerning the handling of
the Darfur issue by the International Criminal Court
remains unchanged. With regard to the media reports
of mass rape in Thabit, China has taken note of the
recent report and conclusions of the Prosecutor General
for Darfur Crimes and the report of UNAMID's
investigation. We hope that UNAMID will strengthen
its communication with the Government of the Sudan
to find a proper settlement of the matter and avoid
disrupting the Darfur peace process.
