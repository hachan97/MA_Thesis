Mr. Doutriaux (France) (spoke in French): We
agree on every point with Mr. Oshima's briefing. My
Government had also dispatched a humanitarian
mission to Angola at approximately the same time as
Mr. Oshima's visit to the country, and we agree with
his conclusions.

The humanitarian situation is still a source of
concern, despite the hopes generated by the peace
process that is currently under way. Therefore the
efforts of the international community must be
sustained, but, as Mr. Oshima said, this must be done in
very close partnership with the Angolan authorities,
which must commit themselves to working to assist the
Angolan population.

My country has decided to double our
contribution to the World Food Programme, whose
activities in Angola have been widely recognized. We
will be helping also to equip health-care facilities and
to assist with temporary schooling for children in the
Sambo quartering area, the most crowded and isolated
UNITA army reception area in the Wambo region.

As Mr. Oshima and other speakers have noted, a
serious problem remains: resettling 4 million internally
displaced persons. We note, as Mr. Oshima mentioned,
that the Angolan Government and UNITA have decided
to work together for peace, a decision that should
facilitate the process of resettling internally displaced
persons.

France will also provide 2 million euros to
support integrated projects in that area, especially in
the Malanje and Wambo areas. The French Foreign
Minister will visit the Wambo region next weekend, in
the context of an official visit by my Minister to
Angola.

Like other delegations, we are looking forward to
the upcoming report by the Secretary-General, on the
basis of Mr. Gambari's expertise, on the role of the
United Nations in supporting and sustaining the peace
process.
