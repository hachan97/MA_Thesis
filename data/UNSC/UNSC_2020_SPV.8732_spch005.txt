Mr. De Riviere (France) (spoke in French): At the outset, I welcome the adoption of resolution 2511 (2020). After a final push, we were able to reach a compromise solution that allowed the Council to remain united. It is therefore all the more regrettable that this unity was abandoned at the time of the vote, since the resolution just adopted contains no problematic elements and we discussed it exhaustively in order to iron out areas of disagreement. I wish to recall that Security Council resolutions are produced by compromise. Each one of us must make concessions and no one can expect to get everything they hope for when entering a negotiation. This is the very foundation of the practice of diplomacy and multilateralism, which we support and defend. What kind of signal are we sending today to the people of Yemen, when they should be at the very heart of the Council's actions? I thank the United Kingdom for its efforts to ensure the resolution was adopted. I call on all members of the Council to negotiate in good faith and to act responsibly in order to maintain the unity of the Council, which should be the rule and not the exception.
