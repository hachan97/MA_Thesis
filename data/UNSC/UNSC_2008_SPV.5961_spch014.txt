The President (spoke in French): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as representative of
Belgium.

I too wish to thank Mr. Pascoe and Mr. Mulet for
their briefings, and would like to make the following
points.
Belgium remains gravely concerned at the
continued presence of Russian troops on Georgian
territory despite the repeated commitments and
assurances that they would be withdrawn. There is no
justification for that presence, which violates the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia.

Belgium reaffirms its commitment to the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of Georgia within its
internationally recognized borders.

Belgium is also very concerned at any action that
poses a threat to Georgia's vital infrastructure. Belgium
calls for respect of the ceasefire and the immediate
withdrawal of Russian troops from areas from which it
must withdraw by the terms of the six-point agreement
signed by the Georgian and Russian Presidents on the
initiative of the President of the French Republic,
acting in his capacity as current President of the
European Union.

Belgium believes that the international
community has a crucial oversight and leadership role
to play. In that connection, Belgium welcomes the
decision taken by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe to rapidly deploy a larger
number of observers. Belgium considers that the
Security Council should remain seized of this matter
with a view to helping to find a solution. In that regard,
Belgium supports the draft resolution circulated by
France today.

Finally, on the humanitarian front, the suffering
of populations affected by this situation is clearly very
worrisome. Belgium once again appeals for the free
and unhampered access of humanitarian aid to the
victims. I wish to stress that ensuring such access is an
integral part of the six-point agreement.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.
