Mr. Sarki (Nigeria): My delegation would like
to thank Assistant Secretaries-General Zerihoun and
Simonovie for their briefings.

Nigeria regards human rights as essential to
ensuring that all human beings live in dignity. We also
believe that all States have an obligation to promote and
protect the rights of their citizens. With human rights
being one of three main pillars of the United Nations,
the Organization has put appropriate mechanisms in
place to protect and promote them around the globe.
Those mechanisms include special procedures, the
universal periodic review (UPR) and treaty bodies.
Nigeria notes that the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea participated in the first and second cycles
of the UPR. We also note that in October, the roving
ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea met with the Special Rapporteur on the situation
of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea. Nigeria encourages the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea to maintain and, indeed, strengthen
its engagement with the Human Rights Council and the
treaty bodies, with a view to promoting and protecting
the rights of its citizens.
