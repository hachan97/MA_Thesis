Mrs. Gueguen (France) (spoke in French): France welcomes the adoption of resolution 2507 (2020), renewing the sanctions regime concerning the Central African Republic. As penholder, we are of the view that the text is a good compromise that we managed to reach following negotiations throughout which the delegation of France strived throughout to play the role of constructive facilitator. As such, I would like to thank the members of the Council for their flexibility, but I deeply regret that we did not adopt the text unanimously. The Security Council is always ready to listen to the legitimate concerns of the Central African authorities about the security of their country. The United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic, a major commitment of the United Nations, ensures the security of the population throughout the country and supports the gradual redeployment of the Central African armed forces. Moreover, in order to help equip and strengthen the mobility and security of the Central African forces, from September to date the Security Council has twice authorized a significant easing of the arms embargo. Finally, I recall that the Central African authorities can take advantage of the exemption procedures stipulated by the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 2127 (2013) concerning the Central African Republic. We believe that, in a security context that remains unstable, it is important to maintain a responsible approach and to ensure support for the Central African authorities in their efforts to advance security sector reform; to disarm, demobilize and reintegrate former members of armed groups; and to manage weapons and ammunition. This is a key element for achieving lasting peace and security in the Central African Republic. France will therefore continue to fully support the Central African authorities in that endeavour.
