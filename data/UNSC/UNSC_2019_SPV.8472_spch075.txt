Mr. Polyanskiy (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I shall not keep anyone here for long but,
building on what was said by the Foreign Minister of
Venezuela, I wish to inform the Council that, as we have
been holding this meeting, the United States delegation
has already managed to kill our draft statement by
introducing amendments condemning the Maduro
Government and so on. It is clear that the United States
approach to Haiti is not appropriate to Venezuela. It
reflects a blatant double standard.
