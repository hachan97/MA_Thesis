Mr. Suescum (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): At
the outset, I should like to thank the representative
Israel and the observer of Palestine for their
statements.
Panama understands that this meeting was
convened to highlight the very serious humanitarian
situation in the Gaza Strip resulting from Israel's
illegal blockade of that part of the occupied Palestinian
territory. We are aware that the matter is part of a
highly complex issue with interrelated aspects that
mutually affect each other. Our delegation will
therefore use the opportunity afforded by the Council's
open debate of 18 December on the situation in the
Middle East, including the Palestinian question, to
convey its position on the various issues under this
item.

With respect to the specific matter before the
Council today, the Government of Israel's reluctance to
lift the illegal blockade, despite the repeated appeals of
the international community and the humanitarian
disaster it is creating for innocent civilians, is a matter
of grave distress to our country. As we have reiterated
repeatedly, Panama is deeply concerned about the
humanitarian situation in Gaza and urges Israel to lift
the illegal blockade forthwith and unconditionally to
allow the delivery of humanitarian assistance.
