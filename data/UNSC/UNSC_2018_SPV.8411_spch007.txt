The President (spoke in Chinese): There are no
more names inscribed on the list of speakers.

Before adjourning, as this is the last scheduled
meeting of the Council for the month of November, I
would like to express the sincere appreciation of the
delegation of China to the members of the Council,
especially my colleagues the Permanent Representatives
and their staffs, and to the Security Council Affairs
Division for all the support they have given us. It has
definitely been a busy month in which we have rallied to
achieve consensus on several important issues within our
purview. We could not have done it alone or without the
hard work, support and positive contributions of every
delegation and the representatives of the Secretariat,
including the Department for General Assembly and
Conference Management, the interpreters, translators
and verbatim reporters, and the security staff. As we
end our presidency, I know that I speak on behalf ofthe

Council in wishing the delegation ofCetc d'lvoirc good
luck for the month of December.

I now invite Council members to informal
consultations to continue our discussion on the subject.

The meeting rose at 10.45 mm.
