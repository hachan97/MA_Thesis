Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We are grateful to the Permanent
Representative of Belgium, Ambassador Grauls, for his
briefing on the work of the 1737 Committee of the
Security Council for the last three month period and
also for the work he has done in heading this
Committee.

We take note of the fact that in this reporting
period, the Committee was acting in strict compliance
with Security Council resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747
(2007) and 1803 (2008). We believe that, in its further
work, the Committee will continue to be guided by the
spirit and letter of those resolutions aiming at
promoting the achievement of the major goal, which is
an effective solution to the Iran nuclear problem solely
through political and diplomatic means, that is, through
negotiations on the basis of proposals formulated by
the group of six.

Resolution 1835 (2008) of the Security Council,
adopted in September, clearly demonstrated the unity
of the group of six around the major unifying goal,
namely, to cooperate with the International Atomic
Energy Agency in fact-finding and in establishing the
lack of any military aspects in Iran's nuclear
programme. There may be tactical divergences, but
these should not weaken the dedication of the group of
six to this most important objective, namely, to
strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime.
