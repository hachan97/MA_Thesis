The President (spoke in French): I thank
Mr. Le Roy for his briefing.

Before I give the floor to the Haitian
Ambassador, all of my colleagues will no doubt join
me in paying tribute to the work of United Nations
personnel on the ground in difficult conditions. I would
ask Mr. Holmes and Mr. Le Roy to convey the
10-24612
appreciation of all Security Council members to their
personnel.

I now give the floor to the representative of Haiti.
