Mr. Budiman (Indonesia): My delegation would
like to respond to the statement made by the
representative of Israel this morning.

The war last summer in southern Lebanon
brought agony to both parties, but it caused human
casualties among the Lebanese. Many of those
casualties were among civilians, and their immediate
physical cause was an incomparably appalling series of
Israeli offensives during the war.

The current security and stability in southern
Lebanon has been made possible by the decisive
response of the Security Council through the adoption
of resolution 1701 (2006), which, inter alia,
strengthened the United Nations Interim Force in

Lebanon. Indonesia underlines the importance of
compliance by all parties with resolution 1701 (2006)
in its entirety. We also stress the urgent need to respect
the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and political
independence of Lebanon.
