The President: As we all are aware, it is now
6.38 pm, and 20 more speakers remain. I wish once
again to request all speakers to limit their statements
to no more than four minutes in order to enable the
Council to carry out its work expeditiously at this late
hour of the evening.

I now give the floor to the representative of Norway.
