The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Serbia, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

Mr. Boris Tadic', President of the Republic of
Serbia, was escorted to a seat at the Council
table.

The President: On behalf of the Council, I
extend a warm welcome to His Excellency Mr. Boris
Tadie, President of the Republic of Serbia.

In accordance with the understanding reached in
the Council's prior consultations, I shall take it that the
Security Council agrees to extend an invitation under
rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure to His
Excellency Mr. Fatmir Sejdiu.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Sejdiu to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in response to a letter dated 17 June 2008 from
the Permanent Representative of Serbia addressed to
the President of the Security Council and contained in
document S/2008/401.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/354, which contains the report of the
2
Secretary-General on the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo.

I welcome the participation of the Secretary-
General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, at this
meeting and invite him to take the floor.
