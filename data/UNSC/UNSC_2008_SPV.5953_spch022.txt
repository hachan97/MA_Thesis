Mr. Alasania (Georgia): First of all, let me
express our gratitude towards the majority - the near-
totality - of the members of the Security Council for
their observations. I also want to express our
appreciation to the Under-Secretary-General and the
Assistant Secretary-General for their observations and
their briefings.

For a moment, I thought that Mr. Churkin did not
hear what the briefers were saying, but then I just
found everything quite logical, because all that we
were hearing here from the Russian Federation is
reminiscent of the statements and propaganda by the
Soviet Union when it invaded Afghanistan, Prague and
Budapest. The statements were not only based on false
information; they were cynical, outrageous and
inhuman.

Since when can a neighbouring country use
strategic bombers and 24-hour non-stop indiscriminate
bombing of civilian targets be called a support of a
peace operation? What are the grounds for Russia
doing something like this?

My region is familiar with Russian-style peace
enforcement. We have seen it twice in my
neighbourhood. When the Republic of Chechnya in the
north Caucasus was erased from the face of the Earth,
we turned a blind eye. We cannot do that now because
that is exactly Russia's intention: to erase Georgian
statehood and to exterminate the Georgian people.
Unless we act together now, that is not going to be
stopped. I urgently call for the Council to take action
today, as was proposed by the majority of Security
Council members.
