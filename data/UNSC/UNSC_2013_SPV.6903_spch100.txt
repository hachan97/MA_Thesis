The President: I shall now make an additional
statement in my national capacity.

I have just one brief remark to make. The fact is
that both India and Pakistan are hosting the United
Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan
(UNMOGIP).
I now resume my functions as the President of the
Council.

I would like to thank all speakers for their
valuable contributions in today's debate. We have had
a comprehensive and enriching discussion that brought
out the challenges and opportunities that exist in the
domain of peacekeeping. We have a vital interest in
the continued effectiveness and success of United
Nations peacekeeping. I hope that today's debate and
its outcome will go a long way towards promoting
that common objective. This morning, the Security
Council unanimously adopted resolution 2086 (2013)
on a multidimensional approach to peacekeeping. The
resolution was sponsored by all 15 members of the
Security Council.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 4.50 pm.
