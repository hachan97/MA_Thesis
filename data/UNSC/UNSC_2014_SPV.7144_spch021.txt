Mr. Cherif (Chad) (spoke in French): I would like
to thank Mr. Eliasson and Mr. Simonovie for their
briefings. I would also like to thank the Permanent
Representative of Ukraine for his statement.

Chad is alarmed by what is taking place in
Ukraine, including in Crimea. We note with a great
deal of concern that, despite the repeated calls by the
international community, in particular the Security
Council, the undermining of the territorial integrity
and sovereignty of Ukraine continues.

We reaffirm once again that we are committed to
the unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and we
urge all parties to comply with the basic principles of
the Charter of the United Nations, including Article 2.
We ask all the relevant parties to give pride of place to
a peaceful settlement. We support the good offices of
the Secretary-General aimed at forging direct dialogue
between the two parties to achieve a political solution.
