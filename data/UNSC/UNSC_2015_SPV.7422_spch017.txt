Mr. Safronkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I regret having to take the floor a second
time, but I am forced to make a statement on behalf of
the Russian Federation.

I was, on the one hand, disappointed by the
comments made by my colleague, the representative
of the United States of America; on the other hand, I
am filled with hope. Why was I disappointed? I was
disappointed because, in March, the people of the
Crimea marked quite a different anniversary - the
anniversary of their historic reunification with the
Russian Federation, based on the outcome of an open
and fair referendum. The people of the Crimea support
that choice unanimously. Now, why did the statement
made by my colleague the representative of the United
States give me hope? I feel hope because she confirmed
the importance and significance of resolution 2202
(2015), which endorses the Minsk package of measures
as a basis for a solution to the situation in Ukraine.
