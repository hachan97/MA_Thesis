Mr. Rycroft (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom welcomes the Council's unanimous adoption
of resolution 2373 (2017) today. We continue to support
a sovereign, stable Lebanon, supported and governed by
legitimate State institutions. We recognize the fact that
the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)
makes a significant contribution to Lebanon's stability
and security. Without UNIFIL carrying out its vital
mission, it would be difficult to argue that Lebanon is
more stable or secure, so we are pleased that UNIFIL's
mandate has been renewed today.
The United Kingdom continues to be concerned
about the violations of resolution 1701 (2006) from both
sides of the Blue Line. UNIFIL must be more confident
and assertive in enforcing its mandate. Our long-term
ambition is to see the Lebanese Armed Forces assert
their authority in southern Lebanon and take over
responsibilities from UNIFIL. We believe that the
resolution we have just adopted provides UNIFIL with
the mandate it needs to do the job properly. We now
urge the mission and its troop-contributing countries
to do everything they can to challenge obstructions to
the mission's operation and freedom of movement and
to seek to enforce its mandate in full. If those critical
requirements are not fulfilled, UNIFIL's forces will
struggle and the Lebanese people will be the ones who
ultimately pay the price. We therefore repeat our call to
all the relevant parties to comply fully with resolution
1701 (2006) and support the critical work that UNIFIL
will continue to carry out over the next year.
