Mr. Johnston (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland): The United Kingdom voted in
favour of the resolution just adopted by the Council to
renew the mandate of the United Nations Mission for
the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) for a
further six months.

Since the resolution is a technical rollover of the
mandate and does not respond to any other
recommendations made in the Secretary-General's
report this month, we would like to set out some
aspects of the situation which we consider to be
particularly important.
We would like to commend MINURSO for its
ongoing stabilization and ceasefire monitoring role,
and for its efforts at restructuring. We would also like
to thank Mr. Van Walsum, the Secretary-General's
Personal Envoy, for his efforts to find a way forward in
the dispute.

The United Kingdom believes that the approach
outlined in the Secretary-General's report - that of
direct negotiations without preconditions - offers a
way to move beyond the current impasse. The United
Kingdom notes the references in the report to the
human rights situation and remains concerned by that
situation. The United Kingdom fully supports the
intention of the Office of the High Commissioner for
Human Rights to send a delegation to the region.

The United Kingdom hopes that there will be
progress beyond the current impasse before the next
mandate renewal in October, and that there will
therefore not need to be another simply technical
rollover. We take this opportunity to stress again that
any solution has to be mutually acceptable, in line with
United Nations requirements as set out in previous
Security Council resolutions.
