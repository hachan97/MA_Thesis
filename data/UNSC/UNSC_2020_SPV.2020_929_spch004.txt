It is an honour for me to address the Council on the maintenance of peace and security. I am a Sahelian girl, born and raised in Mali and Ghana. I carry within me a great responsibility and a lot of love for that region, which is very vulnerable. During my journey along the Great Green Wall from the west to the east of the Sahel, I met the rural communities living there. I realized how urgent it is to find solutions to the effects of desertification and climate change and the impact that can have on security and peace. I remember young men uttering a poignant phrase - "Barcelona or bust". Forced migration and the dream of an El Dorado in Europe have taken away many of our young people. My wish is to bring the African dream back to the continent by offering opportunities and a concrete future to these youth, who constitutes\ more than 50 per cent of the Sahel. Youth and women, in particular, can become major actors of change if we give them the necessary support. Their role is very important. During my trip, I also met children and young people whose families were killed by Boko Haram in northern Nigeria, in a zone weakened by the scarcity of food resources, among other things. I am very hopeful that projects such as the Great Green Wall will help address the multiple problems in the region, such as forced migration, instability and conflict in the Sahel.
