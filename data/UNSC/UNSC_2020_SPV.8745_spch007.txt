The President (spoke in Chinese): Today is Ambassador Karen Pierce's last day as representative of the United Kingdom. I wish to thank her for her final statement at the Security Council and, in my capacity as the representative of China, I would like to thank her for her outstanding contribution to the Council's work. I pay tribute to her. I also wish her every success in her new post. She will be missed. I now resume my functions as President of the Council.
