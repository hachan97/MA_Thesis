Mr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): Peru
shares the United Nations assessment of and concern
regarding the grave humanitarian impact on the civilian
population of the escalation of violence in north-west
Syria and therefore supports all initiatives that are
aimed to protect that population. We therefore thank
the delegations of Germany, Belgium and Kuwait, in
their capacity as co-penholders for humanitarian issues
in Syria, for their considerable efforts to achieve a
compromise acceptable to all members of the Council
on the content of the draft resolution (S/2019/756) put
to the vote this morning. We further appreciate the
fact that the final text managed to satisfy many of the
concerns expressed by our delegation in the course of
negotiations, in which we participated constructively
with a view to achieving a truly effective cessation
of hostilities and provide genuine relief to the civilian
population suffering in Syria. We underscore,
moreover, the emphasis the draft placed on respect
for international humanitarian and human rights law
in all situations and circumstances, which includes, of
course, in the fight against terrorism.

Given all of the foregoing, we were able to vote
in favour of the draft. Peru therefore notes with
grave regret that the draft resolution submitted by
the co-penholders, which we viewed as balanced and
timely, could not be adopted.

In conclusion, we reiterate the need to ensure
that the Council devote grater effort to seeking unity
on such delicate matters so as to discharge the lofty
responsibilities that have been entrusted to us.
