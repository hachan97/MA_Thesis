The President (spoke in Russian): Before we adopt the agenda for today's meeting, I would like to congratulate all members on returning to the Security Council Chamber. The last meeting we held in the Chamber was under the Chinese presidency in March (see S/PV.8745). I want to thank all members for supporting the decision for us to return to the Security Council Chamber. The Economic and Social Council Chamber was very hospitable, but we needed to return to our home, and we have done that today. I want to thank the Secretariat for its support for our joint decision. I wish to say that, while we have set up plastic dividers, our health and safety depend first and foremost on us. We should act responsibly. For example, just before this meeting, I underwent a test for the coronavirus disease. I am pleased to say that it was negative. I would urge members to undergo such a test as often as possible for their own safety and for that of everyone in the Chamber. Adoption of the agenda The agenda was adopted.
