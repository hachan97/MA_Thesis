The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them document
S/2016/660, which contains the text ofa draft resolution
submitted by the United States of America.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members to
document S/2016/552, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on South Sudan.

I now give the floor to those members of the Council
who wish to make statements before the voting.
