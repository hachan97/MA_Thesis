Mr. Jurica (Croatia): Croatia is a sponsor of the
draft resolution that a majority of delegations just a
few minutes ago clearly voted in favour of. We deeply
regret the fact that the Council, due to vetoes, fell short
of its mandate by failing to adopt the draft resolution
on sanctions today.

We firmly believe that the Council's action would
have been timely and has been long awaited, not only
because the situation in Zimbabwe is a clear-cut case
for applying the concept of conflict prevent, but also

because the deep crisis and continuous worsening of
the political, social, economic and humanitarian
situation in Zimbabwe represents a threat to regional
peace and security, and thus to international peace and
security.

Having said that, I would merely affirm that the
measures foreseen in the draft resolution were never
aimed at the people of Zimbabwe; on the contrary, they
targeted those who prevent them from expressing their
own free will and who use violence, fear and
intimidation against their own people to achieve
electoral goals by force.

Furthermore, those measures provided for by the
draft resolution were envisaged as an incentive to
dialogue and national reconciliation. They would have
been instrumental in applying long-needed pressure on
Mr. Mugabe and the ruling clique by sending them a
clear message that the international community cannot
tolerate violence, double standards and the distortion of
democracy at the expense of the Zimbabwean people.

My delegation firmly believes that sanctions
would have contributed to the overall stabilization of
the situation in the country and the region and would
have ultimately led Zimbabwe to the path of true
democracy and prosperity.

Finally, once again, we deplore the results of
today's vote and the failure of the Council to adopt the
resolution.
