Mr. Mantovani (Italy): At the outset, I wish to
welcome here with us today the Minister for Foreign
Affairs of Iraq, His Excellency Mr. Hoshyar Zebari.

Italy voted in favour of the resolution to extend
the mandates of the Development Fund for Iraq and the
International Advisory and Monitoring Board for a
period of 12 months. From the start, Italy has been at
the side of the Iraq people and institutions in their
brave efforts to build a democratic State that is at peace
with itself and with its neighbours. Allow me to
strongly reaffirm this commitment.

Let me also take this opportunity to point out that
the review process for the various Security Council
resolutions on Iraq is to be carried out with the greatest
possible care, in the light of the layering of the texts
and the complexity of the resulting legal situation, so
that the country might regain the high international
standing it enjoyed in 1990. It is a question, in fact, of
guaranteeing the certainty of law, avoiding any impact
on the situations that came to be following the adoption
of resolution 687 (1991) and its follow-up and
safeguarding enterprises that signed contracts with Iraq
prior to the establishment of the sanctions regime and
that have not been able to fulfil their contractual
obligations in compliance with the measures
established by the Security Council.
