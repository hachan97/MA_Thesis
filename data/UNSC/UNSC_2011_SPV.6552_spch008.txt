Mr. Quarrey (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom welcomes the adoption today of resolution
1984 (2011), which extends the work of the Panel of
Experts to support the work of the Iran Sanctions
Committee.

The latest report of the Panel shows that Iran
continues to violate the sanctions imposed on it by the
Council, as illustrated again this week by Iran's claim
to be increasing 20-per-cent-uranium enrichment. The
full implementation of the sanctions is crucial to
preventing Iran from further developing its illicit
nuclear programmes, and in sending a clear signal to
the Iranian regime that its actions aimed at
undermining international peace and security will not
be tolerated.

We believe that the Panel plays a critical role in
ensuring the full implementation of the Council's
sanctions on Iran. Just as Iran adapts to evade those
sanctions, so must the Council adapt to ensure that the
sanctions remain effective. The Panel's
recommendations and its advice to the Council are an
essential part of that.

As we said when we last me on this issue, the
Panel's final report must be made public. The Council
and the wider United Nations membership need the
Panel's advice to guide them in better enforcing the
sanctions.
