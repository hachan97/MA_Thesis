Mr. Thiebaud (France) (interpretation from French): The French delegation supports draft resolution
S/1997/823, on which the Council will soon vote. The
present status of the Angolan peace process justifies the
Security Council following the recommendations of the
Secretary-General on extending the mandate of the United
Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) and on
postponing the withdrawal of United Nations military
formed units.

Moreover, the behaviour of UNITA justifies the
application with respect to that movement of the measures
set out in resolution 1127 (1997) without further delay.
UNITA has yet to fulfil its commitments under the
Lusaka Protocol or to meet its obligations under Security
Council resolutions. It therefore bears the main
responsibility for the problems facing the peace process.
The Security Council has demonstrated patience by
waiting two months to implement the measures set out in
resolution 1127 (1997). The implementation of those
measures must make UNITA understand that its only
chance for the future lies in participation in the country's
political life, with respect for all the commitments it has
undertaken.

 

The Government of Angola, which can rely on the
support of France in the task of national reconstruction,
must heed the appeals of the members of the Security
Council, with particular reference to cooperation with the
United Nations Observer Mission in Angola.
