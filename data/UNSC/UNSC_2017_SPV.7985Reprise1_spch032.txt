Mr.ArriolaRamirez(Paraguay) (spokeinSpanish):
The delegation of the Republic of Paraguay expresses
its gratitude for the briefings by the Under-Secretary-
General and High Representative for Disarmament
Affairs and the representative of the Organization for
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in connection
with the international effort to prevent the proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction by non-State actors,
and commends the Bolivian presidency of the Security
Council for holding this open debate.

The Republic of Paraguay works closely with the
Counter-Terrorism Committee, the delegation of which
headed by its Executive Director visited our country
in March and held meetings with the highest-ranking
officials from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and
those dealing with homeland security, the prevention
of money laundering and customs. During its visit,
the Committee was able to see at first-hand the efforts
undertaken by the Republic of Paraguay to adhere to
international norms in combating terrorism in all its
forms, as well as the implementation of public policies
aimed at preventing the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction by non-State actors, especially in the
border areas of the country.

During its visit, the Committee was able to note the
need for technical assistance and specialized teams in
Paraguay so as to effectively and efficiently implement
mechanisms and policies aimed at preventing all forms
of terrorism and cross-border criminal activity linked
to it. Consequently, at the request of the Paraguayan
Government, the Committee is considering a follow-up
mission this year during which it will hold meetings
with officials from the legislative and judicial
branches. Furthermore, the Republic of Paraguay
participates actively in training activities, as it did in
the regional training course for the points of contact of
the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1540
(2004), held recently in Chile.

The delegation of Paraguay reaffirms its conviction
that the fight against terrorism in all its forms must
contribute to the maintenance of international stability
and security; encourage cooperation and friendly
relations between States, while respecting their national
sovereignty; and be based on the rule oflaw, respect for
human rights in the broadest terms and the fundamental
freedoms of individuals under international law.

In conclusion, the delegation of Paraguay calls on
the States Members of the United Nations to reallocate
the resources budgeted for the modernization of their
stockpiles to efforts aimed at achieving the Sustainable
Development Goals, in particular target 4 of Sustainable
Development Goal 16 - to significantly reduce illicit
arms flows and combat all forms of organized crime.
