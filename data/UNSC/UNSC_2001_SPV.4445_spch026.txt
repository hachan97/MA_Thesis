Mr. Granovsky (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): As it is already late, I shall not read out the
three pages that experts prepared for me. What is
written there is very true, but much of it has already
been said today. I shall therefore confine myself to
what I really want to say, that is, to extend to you and
your delegation, Mr. President, our appreciation for
guiding the Security Council in the month of
December. I would like to take this opportunity to
extend my warmest thanks for the work you and the
other delegations have done during your terms in the
Security Council - Bangladesh, Jamaica, Tunisia and
Ukraine.

I believe we have developed very good -
Iwould say friendly - relations with all those
delegations. All of them have certainly made a real
contribution to the work of the Council. I would like to
stress that each of the delegations completing its term
has had its own face. One could never confuse one with
another. Even if we were to read the verbatim records
and did not already know who had made the statement,
we could always determine who had made the
statement from the statement's content. Each
delegation was thus itself, and was able to act as itself.
We greatly appreciate that. The experience we have
gained working together here in the Council will help
us to cooperate in the future with other bodies and
organs of the United Nations.

In conclusion, I would like to extend to all
colleagues our best wishes for Christmas and the New
Year. I wish everyone the best of health and happiness.
