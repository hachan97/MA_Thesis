The President (spoke in Spanish): I wish to remind
all speakers to limit their statements to no more than
four minutes in order to enable the Council to carry
out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy
statements are kindly requested to circulate the text
in writing and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking in the Chamber. I also appeal to speakers to
deliver their statements at a normal speed so that the
Interpretation Service can carry out its work properly.

I should also like to inform participants that this
open debate will continue through the lunch hour given
the great number of speakers, for which we are very
grateful.

I now give the floor to the Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Thailand.
