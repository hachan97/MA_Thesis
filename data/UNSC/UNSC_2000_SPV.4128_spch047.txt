The President: I thank the representative of Cuba
for his kind words addressed to me, if not to the alliance
to which my country and four other members of the
Council belong.

In accordance with the decision taken earlier in the
meeting, I invite the Permanent Observer of Switzerland
to the United Nations to take a seat at the Council table.
