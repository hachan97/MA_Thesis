Mr. Hyseni: I apologize, but this just came to
mind. When the Secretary-General appointed former
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari to lead a political
process on the final status of Kosovo, this Council set a
number of objectives based on the presidential
statement of the time.

One of the key objectives was to reach a solution
on the status of Kosovo that would ensure peace, safety
and security in the whole of the region. I can assure the
Council that this objective is well on the way to being
achieved thanks not only to the overwhelming support
we are getting from the international community, but
first and foremost to our firm commitment to looking
to the future, and in that context to looking to the
future also in terms of our relationship with Serbia, our
first neighbour to the North.

We are going to seek ways - and we will not
quit, we will not give up our efforts - to reach out to
the Serb community in Kosovo. We have blueprints to
address all of the grievances of the Serb community in
Kosovo. We have carefully crafted plans for the reform
of local self-governance for the Serb-majority areas.
But it is, again and ever again, the Belgrade leadership
that is encouraging and even blackmailing and
threatening the representatives of the Serb community
who wish to work with us for their own benefit in the
first instance. So we need the Serb community to work
with us. We are ready. We do have plans and we are
committed to implementing those plans in detail.

I wish to once again make a plea here, before the
Council, to the leadership in Belgrade to talk to us on
an equal footing, because there are many issues we can
resolve together, but only as two independent and
sovereign States. Kosovo is independent. There is no
way that Kosovo will ever go back to what it was
before.
