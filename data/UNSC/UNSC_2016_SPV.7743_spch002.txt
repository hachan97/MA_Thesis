Mr. Johnson (United Kingdom): This is my first
my Visit to the United Nations as Foreign Secretary, and
I am delighted that it has coincided with the unanimous
adoption of resolution 2298 (2016), which marks an
important step forward for international peace and
security. I recognize that this excellent work goes on
day in and day out, and I am delighted today to be part
of it.

The resolution marks the beginning of the end of
the Libyan chemical weapons programme. It grants the
legal authorization necessary for the Organisation for
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to remove the
chemical precursors of those weapons, so that they can
be destroyed in a third country. In doing so, we have
reduced the risk ofthose weapons falling into the hands
of terrorists and fanatics.

I would like to thank Council members for their
role in making the resolution possible. It is a sign of the
strength of the international cooperation on Libya that
we were able to come together so quickly to agree it.
Together, we have shown our collective commitment to
the people and the authorities of Libya and ultimately
to all of us who want to live in a world free of chemical
weapons. The United Kingdom is committed to making
this world a reality, including through our permanent
seat here in the Security Council.

What we have done today is a good example of the
role of the United Nations in tackling global challenges.
It is also an example of the United Kingdom's
continued determination to play a leading role, through
the United Nations, together with our partners in the
Security Council.
