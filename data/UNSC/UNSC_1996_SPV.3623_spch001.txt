The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received letters from the representatives of
Burundi and Zaire in which they request to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's
agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose,
with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Terence
(Burundi) took a seat at the Council table; Mr.
Lukabu Khabouji N 'Zaji (Zaire) took the seat reserved
for him at the side of the Council Chamber.

The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them documents
S/ 1995/ 1068 and 5/1996/36, which contain the texts of two
letters, dated 29 December 1995 and 16 January 1996
respectively, from the Secretary-General addressed to the
President of the Security Council.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/1996/56, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to document S/ 1996/40, which contains the text
of a letter dated 18 January 1996 from the Permanent
Representative of Burundi to the United Nations
addressed to the President of the Security Council.

The first speaker is the representative of Burundi, on
whom I now call.
