The President: I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Viet Nam.At the outset, Viet Nam would like to thank France, the penholder, and other members of the Security Council for their hard work on resolution 2507 (2020). We welcome the adoption of the resolution, which renews the sanctions regime and further eases the arms embargo on the Central African Republic. It shows that the Council has been closely following the situation in the Central African Republic and seeking ways to support its Government and people in order to achieve sustainable peace in the country. It is important that Security Council resolutions be fully implemented. We are of the view that the ultimate purpose of the sanctions is to pave the way forward for a peaceful and sustainable solution to the crisis. The application of sanctions has to be in conformity with international law and in respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Central African Republic. Viet Nam welcomes the recent positive developments in the Central African Republic and wishes to stress the importance of maintaining conditions favourable to dialogue, the peaceful settlement of disputes and the preparation for the upcoming electoral process. I now resume my functions as President of the Council. I now give the floor to the representative of the Central African Republic.
