Mr. Duale (Somalia): Mr. President, I wish first
and foremost to thank you for convening this meeting
and inviting me to participate. It is a very important
meeting not only for Somalia but for the neighbouring
countries of the region, as well as the international
community and partners.

I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for the
minute of silence and prayers you offered for the
innocent victims of the very recent bombing of the
Hotel Muna in Mogadishu. I also thank the Secretary-
General for his condolences in this regard.

I wish to express my appreciation for the report
of the Secretary-General (S/2010/394), which is very
concise and well thought out. I thank the Legal
Counsel, Ms. Patricia O'Brien, who proposed pertinent
points with regard to the possible implementation of
the recommendations set out in it, especially with
regard to the need for timely action. I am grateful also
for the efforts by the United Nations Office on Drugs
and Crimes to support the possible improvements to
the judicial system and the prisons in Somalia and in
the region. Finally, I thank all the members of the
Council, and I hope the recommendations will be acted
on in a timely manner by all those concerned.
