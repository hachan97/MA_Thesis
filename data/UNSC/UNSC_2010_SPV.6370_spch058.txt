Lieutenant General Obiakor: I should like, on
behalf the heads of military components - the force
commanders present here today - to express gratitude
for this opportunity to speak to the Council on some of
our missions. We are indeed encouraged by this
interaction.

Although we function in very difficult political
and physical environments, and although there is at
times, as the Council has heard from the force
commanders, a mismatch between the tasks and the
resources available, I heard them state that they are
encouraged and ever more dedicated to deliver on their
mandates.

I should also like to seize this opportunity to
thank the Security Council for having given me the
opportunity to serve in the United Nations. I also thank
the Council on behalf of my colleagues.
