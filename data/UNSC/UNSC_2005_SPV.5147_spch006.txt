Mr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese):
I would like to begin by thanking Lord Ashdown for
his report (S/2005/156, annex, enclosure) and for his
supplementary briefing. I also appreciate the efforts he
has made in promoting the peace process in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.

We are pleased to note that, since the second half
of last year, the Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities
have carried out much positive work and have achieved
a great deal in the field of consolidating national
authority, economic recovery and reconstruction,
accelerated institutional reform, facilitating refugee
return and national reconciliation and inculcating the
rule of law. We express our appreciation for all its
achievements.

The Office of the High Representative has also
played a positive facilitating role in those areas. We
welcome the smooth handover from the Stabilization
Force (SFOR) to the European Force (EUFOR). We
believe that the European Union (EU) will make a
useful contribution towards the maintenance of
stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

This year marks the tenth anniversary of the
signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement. Thanks to the
efforts exerted by all sides in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
with the assistance of the international community,
welcome progress has been made in all areas of
national reconstruction in that country. These
achievements in the Bosnia and Herzegovina peace
process are hard won and should be cherished by all
sides.

We expect all sides in Bosnia and Herzegovina to
further advance mutual trust and solidarity in order to
lead their people, of all ethnicities, on the road to
peaceful coexistence and common development.

China has consistently been concerned with the
development of the situation in Bosnia and
Herzegovina and, together with the international
community, we will extend our own efforts for the
achievement of lasting peace and economic
development in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
