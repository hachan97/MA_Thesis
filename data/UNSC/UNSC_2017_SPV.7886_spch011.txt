Mr. Delattre (France) (spoke in French): On
behalf of France and on my own behalf, I should like
to pay special tribute to our colleague and friend Vitaly
Churkin. I should like to convey to his wife, Irina, and
to his family our most sincere condolences and our
deepest sadness, which I would also convey to all of the
Russian Mission.

Vitaly Churkin was an exceptional representative
of the Russian Federation to the United Nations.
Beyond our differences, we always worked in a spirit of
mutual respect and personal friendship. Vitaly Churkin
was more than an exceptional diplomat, more than a
fearsome negotiator; he was a master of diplomacy. He
was one of the most talented diplomats I ever met. We
will miss him greatly, and his spirit will remain here in
the Security Council with us. I will never forget him.
