The President: I thank the representative of
Tunisia for his kinds words addressed to me.

May I crave the Council's indulgence by asking
speakers to be as brief as possible, because we need to
finish on time and to give all speakers on my list the
chance to speak.

The next speaker on my list is the representative
of Bangladesh. I invite him to take a seat at the Council
table and to make his statement.
