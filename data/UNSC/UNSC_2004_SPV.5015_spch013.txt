Mr. Andereya (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): The
international community has made persistent appeals to
the Sudanese authorities to enforce law and order in the
Darfur region and to bring to justice those responsible
for the crimes committed against the civilian
population.

The Chilean Government co-sponsored today's
resolution on the basis of its deep conviction that it is
not possible to continue to hope for action by the
authorities responsible while grave and massive
violations of the fundamental rights of persons,
especially the right to life, continue. The Government
of Chile hopes that, because of the adoption of the
resolution, the Government of the Sudan will follow up
with compliance within the timetable set and thereby
restore justice, order and, ultimately, peace in the
Darfur region.
