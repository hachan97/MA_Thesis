Mr. Seck (Senegal) (spoke in French): Senegal
welcomes the adoption of resolution 2368 (2017),
which we had the honour of co-sponsoring. I would
therefore like to thank and congratulate the delegation
of the United States of America on its leadership in the
consultations and the other members of the Council for
their contributions, which have enriched the text that
we have just adopted, with its 105 paragraphs and 3
annexes that expand the scope and the field of action of
the fight against terrorism.

The resolution refers, under Chapter VII of the
Charter of the United Nations, to numerous and complex
measures to be implemented in the fight against the
Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, Al-Qaida and
individuals, groups and entities that are directly or
indirectly related to them. Whether it be on the dark
net or the stony ground of the Sahel, the fight against
terrorism requires means, technique, coordination and
partnership. That is where international cooperation
must be intensified in order to help the least privileged
States and regions to better understand the complexity
of the fight against terrorism and thereby help them
become more effective in our common struggle.

Within a context where the international community
must more than ever face the problem of the return of
foreign terrorist fighters, the resolution strengthens
the provisions to fight that pernicious phenomenon.
That is the rationale for the support given by Senegal
during the consultations, keeping in mind the scope and
intensity of the phenomenon in Africa - from the Horn
of Africa to the Sahel, including the Lake Chad basin
and the Maghreb.
