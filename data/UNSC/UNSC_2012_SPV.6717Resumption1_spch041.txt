The President (spoke in French): There are no
further speakers inscribed on my list.

Before closing the meeting, I would like, on
behalf of His Excellency Mr. Faure Essozimna
12-23696

Gnassingbe, President of the Togolese Republic, to
thank everyone here today for demonstrating a strong
interest in the issue of security, which calls to all of us.
All of today's productive statements point to a path for
some day eradicating the scourge of transnational
organized crime.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
