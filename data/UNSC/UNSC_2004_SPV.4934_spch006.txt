Mr. Pleuger (Germany): Germany abstained in
the voting on the draft resolution at issue. The reason is
that the draft resolution addresses the recent events in
the Middle East in an unbalanced manner.

The Council of Foreign Ministers of the European
Union (EU), on 23 March, unequivocally condemned
the extrajudicial killing of Hamas leader Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin and of six other Palestinians by Israeli
forces. The EU, including Germany, has always
opposed extrajudicial killings. My Government
believes not only that they are contrary to international
law but also that they undermine the concept of the rule
of law, which is a key element in the fight against
terrorism. I reiterated that position, and our position on
the Middle East conflict, in no uncertain terms during
the open meeting of the Council two days ago.

At the same time, Germany and the EU have in
the past repeatedly condemned the terrorist atrocities
that have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Israelis.
Just last week, two terrorist attacks in Ashdod claimed
10 innocent lives. The draft resolution does not address
those facts in an appropriate manner, as did the
declaration of the EU ministers a couple of days ago.

We tried hard to be able to vote in favour of the
draft resolution by introducing balancing language
from the declaration of the EU foreign ministers.
Germany, for its part, feels bound by the statement of
the EU's Council of Foreign Ministers of three days
ago, which clearly condemned the wrongdoings of both
sides. Consequently, Germany was not able to vote in
favour of a draft resolution that falls short of that
common European position.
