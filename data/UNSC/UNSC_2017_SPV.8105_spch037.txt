Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
strongly condemns the use of chemical weapons inside
Syria. We support investigations into the incidents so as
to bring tojustice the perpetrators and those responsible
for unleashing the chemical-weapons attacks.

We support the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative
Mechanism (JIM) in continuing its work. The draft
resolution on which the Council voted (S/2017/968)
contains the proposed extension of the JIM. mandate
by a year, condemns the chemical weapons attacks in
Syria, demands investigations, and expresses concern
over the use of chemical weapons by non-State actors,
including terrorist organizations. It also seeks to
improve theJIM's working methods and mandate and
to strengthen its on-site investigation and evidence
collection, and proposes specific measures to improve
the JIM's work and to ensure the reliability and
credibility of the conclusions of its investigations.

China supported and voted in favour of the draft
resolution. We regret the fact that it was not adopted.
