Mr. Usman (Pakistan): We regret that the Afghan
Permanent Representative has yet again chosen to
criticize Pakistan for its internal problems. We reject
such insinuations. Pakistan will not assume the role
of scapegoat for the failures of other countries. We
call upon the Afghan Government to work with the
Government of Pakistan in the same spirit of the recent
meeting held for our two Foreign Ministers in order to
address security and economic challenges in a mutually
beneficial manner.

The meeting rose at 6pm.
