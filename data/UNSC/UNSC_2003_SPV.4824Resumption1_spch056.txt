The President: I thank all of those who have
contributed to a fairly long debate, but I think a good
debate. We have managed 47 interventions - which I
think is not bad - and we have done so in a way that
has preserved a sense of the importance of the subject
and that I hope has done justice to what we are trying
to do as the Security Council.

The Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda. Informal
consultations will begin in 10 minutes.

The meeting rose at 5.20 p.m.
