The President: In my national capacity, let me
briefly reassure the representative of Pakistan that
the United Kingdom will remain a strong European
economic and security player after Brexit.

Resuming my capacity as President of the
Council, I would like to thank our interpreters for
their forbearance. There are still a number of speakers
remaining on my list for this meeting and I intend,
with the concurrence of the members of the Council, to
suspend the meeting until 3 pm. sharp.

The meeting was suspended at 1.05 pm.
