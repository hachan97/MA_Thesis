Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I will be brief. I
have a practice in this Chamber of stepping in when
I see criticism of the Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs to defend the humanitarian
wing of the United Nations, the members of which
care far more about the Syrian people than their own
Government and are working in extraordinarily difficult
circumstances to save lives. Ithink that it behoves all of
us to pay tribute to them for that.
