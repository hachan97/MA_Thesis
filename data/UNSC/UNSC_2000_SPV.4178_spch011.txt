Mr. Gatilov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation, as a member of the
troika of States observers of the implementation of the
peace process in Angola, fully concurs with the
statement made by the representative of the United
States on its behalf, relating primarily to the need for
implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, for support for
national dialogue and reconciliation and for ensuring a
democratic political process and protection of human
rights.

The troika is unanimous in holding Savimbi
responsible for the continuation of the conflict in
Angola. Russia fully shares the view that by his actions
the leader of UNITA has excluded himself from the
political process, and that as long as he fails to take
irreversible steps to implement the Lusaka Protocol he
cannot hope to participate in the dialogue.

Like other members of the troika, Russia believes
that the consistent implementation and enhancement of
the effectiveness of the sanctions regime against
UNITA is an important element of international efforts
to end the conflict in Angola, and it supports the work
of the Security Council Committee on sanctions against
UNITA, under the chairmanship of Ambassador
Fowler. Together with our partners in the troika, we
would appeal to the international donor community to
expand its support to Angola to overcome the aftermath
of this long-lasting conflict and to bring about a life of
peace, particularly in those territories which until quite
recently were under UNITA's control.
