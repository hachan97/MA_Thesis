Judge Byron: I wanted to say, from my personal
point of View, I have been quite inspired by the
thoughtful and well-informed statements of the
members of the Security Council. On behalf of the
Tribunal, I think we are extremely grateful for the
words of appreciation for the work we have done and
for the declarations of continuing support. I will
certainly undertake to convey to the staff of the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) the
laudatory and encouraging remarks that some of you
have expressed. I am sure that it will encourage their
dedication even further as we work towards the
Completion Strategy.

In this regard, I must also include a special
expression of appreciation to the representative of the
Republic of Rwanda for his assurance of his
Government's appreciation for the work we are doing.
I would like to confirm, on behalf of the Tribunal, that
the Republic of Rwanda, has, in fact, been cooperating
with the work of the Tribunal.

We have taken note of the concerns and the
suggestions that have been expressed. With regard to
the legacy, we are actively engaged internally in
discussions and also in dialogue with the International
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and we
will participate in the discussion scheduled for
tomorrow with the working group on the subject.

Finally, I would just like to confirm the
commitment of the ICTR to use its best efforts to
honour the mandates of the Completion Strategy and to
work as effectively and efficiently as we can to meet
this challenge.
