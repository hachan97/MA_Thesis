Mr. Stephanides (Director of the Security Council Affairs Division): The draft annual report of
the Security Council for the period 1 August 2002 to
31 July 2003, to be submitted to the General Assembly
in pursuance of Article 24, paragraph 3, of the United
Nations Charter, has been prepared by the Secretariat
in line with the revised format agreed upon by the
Security Council in 2002.

The format of the draft report before the Council
provides a guide to the activities of the Council in a
concise manner. In this connection, I should like to
note that this is the second report prepared in
accordance with the provisions of the note by the
President of the Council of 22 May 2002 (S/2002/l99),
which were aimed at enhancing the quality of the
report and accommodating the views expressed on the
previous format.

Of particular interest is the introduction to the
report, which contains an analytical summary of the
work of the Council for the period covered by the
report.

A note containing changes requested by two
Council members and deletions and additions made by
the Secretariat is also before the Council.
