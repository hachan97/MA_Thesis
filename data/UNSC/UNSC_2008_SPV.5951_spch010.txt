Mr. Mantovani (Italy): We are extremely
concerned at the escalation of violence in the region of

South Ossetia, Georgia. It is particular sad to face such
a scenario while in Beijing in a few hours the Olympic
Games will be declared open. Once again, all the calls
for a universal Olympic Truce, issued by our world
body, are being blatantly ignored. Even though this
conflict does not appear on the Council's agenda, we
cannot dismiss our responsibilities vis-a-vis a situation
that could further deteriorate and affect the stability of
the entire region.

Echoing the appeals made to the parties today by
the Secretary-General, by the presidency of the
European Union (EU) and by the EU High
Representative, we affirm that violence must
immediately give way to dialogue and negotiations.
The first important step is to restore the situation on
the ground that existed before. Any actor who is in a
position to advise the parties should exert all his
influence to inspire moderation and restraint. We still
see a key role for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in the settlement of the
conflict, but for the OSCE to play that role, weapons
should first be put down and the sides should
immediately resume direct talks. The latest events
further demonstrate that the current situation in the
conflict areas of the region is simply unsustainable.
