Mr. Shen Guofang (China) (spoke in Chinese):
Today, we are at a historic juncture. The Security Council
is about to authorize the establishment of the United
Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor
(UNTAET), fully demonstrating United Nations
commitment to the people of East Timor.

China, Indonesia and East Timor are all in the same
region. We sincerely hope that the people of East Timor,
with United Nations assistance, will be able as soon as
possible to restore stability, develop their economy and
establish amicable and good-neighbourly relations with their
neighbours.

China fully supports UNTAET in its work and will be
sending personnel to participate in it. I wish to take this
opportunity to thank the Secretary-General's Personal
Representative, Mr. Marker, the Special Representative of
the Secretary-General, Mr. Martin, and the United Nations
Mission in East Timor for the enormous amount of work
they have already accomplished in very difficult
circumstances. We will also fully support the new Special
Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Vieira de
Mello, in his work and we trust that he will prove worthy
of all our hopes.

I also wish to note that East Timor will ultimately
have to be governed by the East Timorese people
themselves. The United Nations presence in East Timor is
to assist that island's people to achieve independence and
self-reliance. Thus, the principle of the East Timorese
people's involvement as principal actor must be upheld and
its wishes and choices respected. To the greatest extent
feasible, locals should be fully involved and play their due
role.
The Chinese delegation participated in the
consultations on the draft resolution in a constructive spirit.
We wish to thank the sponsors for accepting our
amendments. We will vote in favour of the draft resolution
before us.
