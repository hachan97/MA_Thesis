Ms. Haq: First of all, let me thank you very
much, Madame President, for so ably chairing this
meeting under Brazil's presidency. I also wish to thank
you and all your colleagues for the excellent
cooperation that we have had in this process. I would
also like to convey my thanks to all the members of the
Security Council for their expressions of support.
Similarly, I would like to take this opportunity to thank
Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao for having been here
with us to continue the same expression of support for
our work back in Dili. I would also like to thank all the
Council members for the confidence that they have
expressed in the United Nations Integrated Mission in
Timor-Leste, as well as for the extension of the
mandate. As the Prime Minister has so ably said, we
will now again continue our work in Timor-Leste.
