Mr. Cherif (Chad) (spoke in French): I would like
to thank Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman for
his briefing on the recent tragic events in Ukraine.

Chad expresses its deepest sympathy and
condolences to the families of the 298 victims of the
crash of the Malaysia Airlines aircraft. Given the
numerous nationalities among the victims, this tragic
event has an impact on peace and security throughout
the entire international community. Whatever the
nature and perpetrators of this incident, this is about
human lives. Chad joins the rest of the international
community in calling for the launch a full and
transparent international investigation to shed light
on the circumstances surrounding the crash and to
establish responsibility for the catastrophe. In that
regard, we welcome the willingness of Ukrainian
authorities to expand the investigation to include
independent international experts.
At this time sensitive time of grief, Chad reiterates
its call on all parties involved to exercise calm and
restraint. We urge countries with influence on the
parties to the conflict to encourage dialogue and
reconciliation. Chad takes note of the announcement
by the insurgents that they would observe a ceasefire
to allow for the removal of bodies, as well as the
willingness of the Ukrainian Government to implement
a peace plan with a view to establishing the foundation
for an inclusive political dialogue, which is the only
possible way to resolve this serious crisis.
