Mr. Gillerman (Israel): Once again, I must agree
with my colleague. He is very right: violence indeed
breeds violence. The violence emanating from Lebanon
against Israel, after Israel totally vacated and withdrew
from every inch of Lebanon, is indeed violence. It
cannot be justified; there are no more alibis. When the
representative of Lebanon says that his country wants
the Sheba'a farms back, he should ask his neighbours,
the Syrians, to return them. They claim that the
Sheba'a farms are Syrian. We cannot give back
something that is not ours. All we know is that the
Security Council has declared emphatically,
categorically and unequivocally that Israel has left
every single millimetre - not inch, but millimetre -
of Lebanon. How long can we keep hearing these alibis
and excuses for the violence?

Violence is there because Lebanon has allowed
violence to take it over. It has allowed a peaceful, fun-
loving, entrepreneurial and cultural country to become
a hotbed of terrorism and a cesspool of hatred. When
those children are incited the way they are, do not
expect them to grow up any other way. Those children
do not need Qana in order to hate us. All they have to
do is to read the textbooks from which Hizbollah
teaches them, and to hear the sermons they hear in their
places of teaching and prayer. They do not need any
further incentive. I believe that no baby is born
wanting to be a suicide bomber, and no mother gives
birth to a child wanting him to become a shahid. But if
that is the kind of culture they grow up in, indeed
violence breeds violence.
