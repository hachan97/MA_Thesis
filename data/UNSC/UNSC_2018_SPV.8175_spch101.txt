The President (spoke in Arabic): We have heard
the last speaker on the list of speakers.

Before I conclude this meeting, I would like
once again to thank Mr. Martin for his briefing and
for participating in this meeting for six full hours. I
would also like to thank all Member States that took
part in the meeting and provided ideas and suggestions.
They will be very useful in our endeavour to make the
Council's work more transparent and to improve its
working methods. This will definitely be an ongoing
process and will not be time bound.

The meeting rose at 4.15 pm.
