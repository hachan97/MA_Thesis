Mr. Qin Huasun (China) (interpretation from Chinese): Thanks to the efforts of the Haitian Government
and people, and the assistance of the international
community, the peace process in Haiti continues to move
in a favourable direction. The political situation in Haiti
has improved further and the society is generally stable.
The law enforcement capabilities of the Haitian police
have also been notably enhanced. The Chinese delegation
is pleased with these welcome developments.

China supports the peace process in Haiti. I myself
once had the opportunity to see what was happening in
Haiti. The efforts by the Haitian Government to maintain
political and social stability will help create a favourable
environment in Haiti to attract foreign financial assistance
and investment. This will also contribute to economic
reconstruction in the country and the improvement of the
people's living standards.

We believe that under the current circumstances the
United Nations peacekeeping mission in Haiti is over. The
main task now facing Haiti is economic reconstruction,
which will mainly depend on the Haitian people
themselves. In this connection, the international
community, particularly the international financial
institutions and other United Nations agencies, should
play an active role.

In view of the urgent request of the Haitian
Government for the extension of the mandate of
UN SMIH, we are ready to treat it as a unique case, so as
to promote further the peace process in Haiti. The draft
resolution before us (S/ 1996/ 1002) has not only
accommodated the request of the Haitian Government, but
has also taken into proper consideration the actual needs
and positions of all those concerned. We will therefore
vote in favour of this draft resolution.

We hope that the Haitian Government will continue
its efforts to maintain social stability and speed up
economic reconstruction so that the Haitian people will be
able to live and work in peace and happiness at an early
date.
