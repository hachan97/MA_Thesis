The President: I thank the representative of the
United Republic of Tanzania for his kind words addressed
to my predecessor and to myself.

Let me remind speakers that the Council has agreed
upon a new practice, according to which speakers are
encouraged to forgo the expression of compliments at the
beginning of their statements.

The next speaker is the representative of Canada. I
invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make
his statement.
