Mr. Eide: I do not think that there have been any
questions directed to me, but may I perhaps make a
few comments.

First of all, I am struck at seeing how in
agreement the Council is with regard to the essentials
and the priorities set by the Paris Conference,
including support for the Afghan Government and all it
is doing through the Development Strategy that has
now been launched.

Secondly, may I say that the support the Council
provides for the United Nations Mission is more than
encouraging. It warms me, and certainly it will warm
the Mission to know that here in New York there is
such broad support, and that the Council trusts us in
the many tasks that we have in front of us.

The coordination task is going to be tremendous,
and success depends, of course, on countries being
willing to be coordinated. But I must say I sense around
this table and around other tables that there is a
different attitude on this issue today "there is a greater
readiness to be coordinated. It is a considerable agenda.
I can promise the Council that we will do our best, and
I am pleased to see that it is ready to provide resources.

May I also say one thing at the very end: that we
will do this under Afghan leadership, under the
leadership of the Afghan Government - and I am
pleased to have the Foreign Minister next to me - and
that we will do it in the service of the Afghan people,
who need it so much.
