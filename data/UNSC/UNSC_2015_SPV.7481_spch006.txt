Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We are gathered here today to pay tribute to
the memory of all the victims of the monstrous crimes
committed in and around Srebrenica two decades ago.

Before proceeding, Mr. President, I would like to
ask you to call for a minute of silence to honour their
memory.
