The President: As this is the first meeting of the
Security Council for the month of April, I should like
to take this opportunity to pay tribute, on behalf of the
Council, to His Excellency Mr. Jean-Marc de La
Sabliere, Permanent Representative of France to the
United Nations, for his service as President in March
2004. I am sure I speak for all members of the Council
in expressing deep appreciation to Mr. De La Sabliere
for the great diplomatic skill with which he conducted
the Council's business last month.

Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.

The situation in Cyprus

The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Alvaro de Soto, Special Adviser to
the Secretary-General on Cyprus.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. De Soto to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Alvaro de Soto, Special Adviser to the
Secretary-General on Cyprus. I now give him the
floor.
