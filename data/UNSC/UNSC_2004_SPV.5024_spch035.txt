Mr. Annabi: There was only one specific
question, from the representative of France. I will
therefore be very brief.

Of course, we are all fully aware of the
implications of the decision by the Indonesian Appeals
Court to overturn the convictions of Indonesian
military and police officials who had been convicted of
serious crimes committed in Timor-Leste in 1999. In
that regard, the position of the Secretary-General is
clear. He has stressed repeatedly the need to ensure that
those responsible for serious crimes are brought to
justice and that there should be no impunity for the
perpetrators.

The Secretary-General has asked the United
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to
prepare a comprehensive report on the progress to date
in the serious crimes process, both in Indonesia and in
Timor-Leste. We expect that report to be completed by
the end of September or in early October. We shall then
be in a better position to consider, on the basis of the

report and in consultation with the Security Council, what actions could be taken to ensure that the serious
crimes process moves forward and that impunity does
not prevail.
