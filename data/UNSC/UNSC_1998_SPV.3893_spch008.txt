Mr. Richardson (United States of America): The
United States is pleased to support the draft resolution now
before the Council authorizing the export to Iraq of spare
parts and equipment to assist in refurbishing Iraq's
oil-export infrastructure.

This action, anticipated in paragraph 12 of resolution
1153 (1998), will enable Iraq to increase its capacity to
export oil and is consistent with the recommendations of
the Secretary-General regarding the pressing requirements
of the United Nations humanitarian programme in Iraq. It
is a very important step forward in the Council's efforts to
ensure that the genuine humanitarian needs of all Iraq's
people are met.

This draft resolution is a non-political, technical draft.
Its purpose is to implement the recommendations of the
Secretary-General as contained in his report of 1 February,
which was explicitly endorsed by the Council in resolution
1153 (1998).

This draft resolution streamlines the process approved
under resolutions 986 (1995) and 1153 (1998) by
eliminating the expensive and time-consuming requirement
to rewrite the distribution plan every six months, thereby
preventing future disruptions in the humanitarian
programme.

If there are to be new distribution plans - an
outcome not precluded by this action today - this draft
resolution ensures that there will be no gaps, as we have
seen in the past, between Iraqi distribution plans. So there
can be no more excuse for delays in future oil sales for
humanitarian purposes or in the delivery of food and
medicine to the people of Iraq. And it makes it clear that
the Council firmly intends to renew the humanitarian
programme as long as it is needed.

This is what the Secretary-General has asked for. It
is what the Council has already endorsed. We consider
this draft resolution a humanitarian victory, and the
winners are the people of Iraq.
