Mr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): I would like to join preceding speakers in
welcoming Mr. Morris and to express my satisfaction
at his very informative briefing. This is one of the most
urgent and important of issues and is one to which the
Security Council has not devoted enough time. As
Ambassador Greenstock mentioned, there are certain
limits to the responsibilities of the Security Council.
This issue relates to the responsibility of States and, as
Ambassador Schumacher of Germany said, to good
governance. However, despite those limitations, I think
that this issue is very important. It deserves further
consideration so that we can clarify the role that the
Council could play in resolving this important problem.

At the start of his presentation, Mr. Morris
mentioned the timely issue of Iraq. We are closely
watching the role played by the World Food
Programme (WFP) within the framework of the oil-for-
food programme. I think that it has played a very
constructive role. I believe Mr. Morris will agree with
me when I say that the situation has changed since the
war in Iraq began. We believe that there is a new role
for the WFP and humanitarian agencies to play, which
would be separate from the role of the oil-for-food
programme. That is because the oil-for-food
programme was limited to meeting the needs of the
Iraqi people during a specific period of time and in a
very specific situation. But now, everything has
changed. There is a war. That war must be governed by
the Geneva Conventions, in particular the Fourth
Geneva Convention. We believe that we should not use
the Iraqi people's own funds to assist them. We should
not take money from their pockets in order to feed
them. International funds have to be used. Does the
WFP now have the necessary funds to meet the new
needs created by the war?
