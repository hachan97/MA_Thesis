Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Mr. President, we would like to request that
draft resolution S/2017/933, submitted by the Russian
Federation, be put to the vote second and that draft
resolution S/2017/962, submitted by the United States
of America, be put to the vote first. We know that the
United States has told you and the Council that we
should vote on our draft resolution first, in accordance
with rule 32 of the Security Council's provisional rules
of procedure. We do not agree with that reasoning,
however. It is impossible for our draft resolution to
be put to the vote first without our permission, for the
following reasons.

The priority provided for in rule 32, on the
consideration of draft resolutions in accordance with
the order of their submission, allows for the possibility
and right that whoever submits a draft resolution first
can request that it be put to a vote first in cases when
there is a counter draft before the Council, which in
this case is the draft resolution submitted by the United
States. However, that is a privilege that one can refuse
to avail oneself of. Submission under rule 32 is not the
same as publication in blue. The two terms are often
confused, in fact, but incorrectly. If we follow the rules
of procedure, submission should include publication
in blue and the request for a vote. The United States
delegation was the first to request a vote, and in that
case our draft resolution should be put to the vote
second, because we asked for the vote after them. We
therefore insist on our draft resolution being put to the
vote second.
