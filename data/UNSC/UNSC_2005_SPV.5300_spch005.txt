Mr. Haneda (Japan): Japan welcomes the
unanimous adoption of resolution 1637 (2005). The
nature of this resolution is primarily technical, aimed at
extending the mandates of the multinational force and
of the Development Fund for Iraq and its International
Advisory and Monitoring Board. However, the Iraqi
side, in anticipation of the imminent start of the
election campaign, had requested early adoption of this
resolution.

Also, for countries contributing troops to the
multinational force, including my country, it was
vitally important to gain a stable perspective on the
troop contribution framework through the early
adoption of this resolution. The text of the draft
resolution prepared by the United States and the United
Kingdom has been amplified significantly with a full
complement of political messages. Considering the
importance of the draft resolution, Japan decided to
join in sponsoring it.

We hope that the unanimous adoption of this
resolution will send the right message to the Iraqi
public, the international community and the citizenry
of each troop-contributing country regarding the
necessity of a continued presence of the multinational
force.
