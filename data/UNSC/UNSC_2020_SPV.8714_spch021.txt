Mr. Polyanskiy (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We are always impressed by the institutional memory of Mr. Heusgen, who took partinthenegotiations on drafting the Minsk agreements, although his memory has recently started to significantly fail him. Regarding the aggression against Ukraine, in recent history there is only one example of such aggression, namely, on 22 June 1941. We will not mention the country that carried out that aggression, particularly since the nationalistic forces in Ukraine are trying to forget about it and, in fact, echo Mr. Heusgen's words about the supposed Russian aggression. I will not return to the issue of Flight MH-17. Our position is well known. There is no convincing evidence. Russia has not been involved in the investigation. I do not think that this is a topic for our discussion today. I would just urge Mr. Heusgen to act responsibly. He is promoting some very good initiatives, which we support - children in armed conflict and women, peace and security. Each statement in which he abets the Ukrainians' unwillingness to engage in dialogue with their own people does not theoretically promote those initiatives that he supports but has a concrete impact on the women and children in Donbas who are dying due to the bullets of Ukrainian soldiers. He should think about that next time he makes a statement.
