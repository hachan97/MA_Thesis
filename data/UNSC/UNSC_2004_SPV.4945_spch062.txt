Mr. Jenie (Indonesia): My delegation is shocked
at the assassination by Israel on Saturday of the new
leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas,
leader, Mr. Abdel Aziz Al-Rantisi. Also falling prey to
Israeli missiles were two of his bodyguards and several
Palestinian citizens. We would like to express our
condolences to the families of the bereaved and to the
Palestinian people. This brutal assassination comes less
than one month after Israel similarly murdered Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin, who was Mr. Al-Rantisi's predecessor
and the organization's spiritual leader and founder,
which was roundly condemned by Indonesia at that
time. Unfortunately, history has been repeated.

Indonesia unreservedly condemns this reckless
and total disregard for international law, for human life
and for the views and sensitivities of the international
community. As we have said in the past, apart from the
illegality of Israel's targeted assassinations, the policy
can promote only violence and insecurity, not peace.
What is worse is that this assassination confirms
Israel's loss of interest in and commitment to the peace
process.

Indonesia once again calls on Israel to return its
faith to negotiations with the Palestinians, not in guns
and bullets, or in artificial walls of separation and
security. It is of the utmost importance immediately to
halt the brutal extrajudicial assassinations of
Palestinians, which can only inspire revenge violence.

Finally, we call on the international community to
put the necessary pressure on Israel to return to the
negotiating table and to prevent Israel from repeating
this pattern of extrajudicial executions. It is only in the
faithful implementation of the road map that a just and
comprehensive settlement of the crisis can ever be
realized.
