Mr. Hoxhaj: I am going to make some remarks
not about the past but about the future.
First, I think that it is necessary for all sides to
call for a stop to the violence in the northern part of
Kosovo, and for the situation there to show some
improvement 12 years after the war.

Secondly, security and stability in that part of
Kosovo, within Kosovo as a whole and in the region
are always going to be a challenge as long as security
forces, paramilitary organizations and police forces
from the Republic of Serbia are operating in that part
of Kosovo. Accordingly, it is really time for Serbia to
dismantle these structures. We have seen the same
phenomenon occur everywhere in the former
Yugoslavia over the past 20 years; that has been the
situation from 1991 until today.

Thirdly, we are very interested in solving all
problems through dialogue, and we call on Serbia to
start implementing the agreements reached in Brussels.
To date, there has been the possibility of seeing
implementation only of the agreement on customs
11-60960
stamps, but nothing else. Nothing else has been
implemented until now.

Regarding the barricades, the European Union
insists on two principles - freedom of movement of
peoples and freedom of movement of goods. If Serbia
aspires to European Union candidate status but is
putting up barricades in a part of another country, I
think that is the best evidence of how interested Serbia
is in a European future.

I will stop here. I am not interested in bothering
the Council with more remarks. At the same time, I call
on my friends not to bring the spirit of a Balkan
country election campaign into a meeting of the
Security Council.
