The President (spoke in Chinese): I thank
Mr. Kalomoh for his statement.

I wish to remind all speakers to limit their
statements to no more than five minutes, in accordance
with the understanding reached among Council
members and in order to enable the Council to carry
out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy
statements are kindly requested to circulate their text in
writing and to deliver a condensed version when
addressing the Council.
