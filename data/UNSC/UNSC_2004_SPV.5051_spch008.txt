Mr. Mercado (Philippines): My delegation
supported the draft resolution on which the Council has
just taken action. We reiterate our concern about the
escalating violence in the Middle East, which has
resulted in the loss of countless innocent civilian lives,
including children. We urge both sides to halt the
violence. We call on Israel to stop its military assault in
northern Gaza. We also call on the Palestinian
Authority to stop the rocket attacks by militant groups
against Israel.

There will be no peace in the Middle East unless
the cycle of attack and reprisal is stopped on both
sides. We will say it again: violence will not produce
any winners in this conflict. We continue to appeal to
both sides to restart the peace process within the
framework of the road map. We ask both parties to
fulfil their obligations under the road map to achieve a
comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle
East.
