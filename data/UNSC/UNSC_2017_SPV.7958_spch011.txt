Mr. Skoog (Sweden): Like others, we welcome
the unanimous adoption of today's Security Council
resolution 2356 (2017). The Council's action comes
in response to the intensified pattern of provocations
by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and
demonstrates, once again, the unity and resolve of the
Council on this issue.

Sweden condemns in the strongest terms the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea's repeated
launches of ballistic missiles. Such actions are in
blatant violation of the relevant Security Council
resolutions. We stand with the neighbouring countries
and their peoples, who are living under the constant
shadow of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's
threatening behaviour.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea
continues to show blatant disregard for its international
obligations. The implementation of all the relevant
resolutions, including the one just adopted, is crucial.
We call on all States Members of the United Nations to
meet their obligations in that regard.

Finally, sanctions alone will not solve the
situation on the Korean peninsula. Intensified and
creative diplomatic efforts are needed to avoid
misunderstandings and further escalation and to begin
to prepare for a peaceful, diplomatic and comprehensive
solution for the peninsula and the wider region. We
call on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to
re-engage in a credible and meaningful dialogue with
the international community.
