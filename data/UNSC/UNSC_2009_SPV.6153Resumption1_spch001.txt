The President: I wish to remind all speakers, as I
indicated at the morning session, to limit, if possible,
their statements to no more than five minutes in order
to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing and to
deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.

Before I start giving the floor, I would like to
welcome our new Assistant Secretary-General for Field
Support, Mr. Anthony Banbury. He has joined us in the
Secretariat and today in the Security Council. I
welcome him and wish him continued success.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Brazil.
