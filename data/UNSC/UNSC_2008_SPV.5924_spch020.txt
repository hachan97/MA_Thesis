Mr. Grauls (Belgium) (spoke in French): My
delegation welcomes the Prime Minister of the
Republic of Djibouti and the representatives of Eritrea,
the African Union and the League of Arab States. We
also thank the Secretariat for its briefing.

Belgium shares the concern expressed around this
table regarding the border incidents that took place
from 10 to 12 June in Ras Doumeira and Doumeira
Island. Those incidents caused numerous deaths and
much damage, and could have quickly degenerated.
The situation continues to run a serious risk of
escalation that is not limited to the countries concerned
but potentially threatens the entire region.

The Security Council reacted speedily on 12 June
by reminding both countries of their commitment to
dialogue, if necessary with the assistance of other
countries and regional organizations. That appeal
remains valid.

Belgium thanks all those who have helped in the
search for a settlement to the crisis. It is in the interests
of neither country to prolong the current situation of
confusion. Belgium encourages the two countries
themselves, first and foremost, as well as others
involved, including the Secretary-General, to pursue
their efforts. Belgium supports the dispatch by the
Secretary-General of a fact-finding mission and
encourages him to consult with the African Union and
the League of Arab States with respect to the
conclusions from their respective initiatives.

Finally, my delegation wishes to thank France for
submitting elements of language for a statement to the
press.
