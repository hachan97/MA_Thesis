Mr. DeLaurentis (United States of America): I
regret having to take the floor at this late hour. I thank
you again, Sir, for organizing this meeting on this
critical issue. Unfortunately, the contribution of the
delegation of the Venezuela to our debate today was to
focus its statement on irrelevant and extraneous issues
that had little to do with the subject at hand. It is
regrettable that Venezuela has sought to use this
opportunity to promote other objectives. In our view, it
was a disservice to this Council and to your efforts
today, Sir.
