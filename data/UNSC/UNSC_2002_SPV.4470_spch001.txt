The President (spoke in Spanish): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Ruud Lubbers, High Commissioner
for Refugees.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Lubbers to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Ruud Lubbers, High Commissioner for
Refugees. After the briefing, I shall give the floor to
Council members who wish to comment or ask
questions.

I now give the floor to Mr. Lubbers.
