Mr. Laro (Nigeria): Nigeria is deeply concerned by
the deteriorating political, security and humanitarian
situation in Yemen. We have repeatedly stated that
the crisis in Yemen cannot be resolved militarily. The
only path to sustainable peace and stability in Yemen
is through negotiation and dialogue. We call on all
parties in Yemen to return to the political process in
line with the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative and
Implementation Mechanism, as well as the outcomes of
the National Dialogue Conference, in which all parties
participated. Our Wish is to see in the very near future a
peaceful, prosperous, united and stable Yemen in which
all communities live together in harmony. It is our hope
that resolution 2216 (2015), which the Security Council
has just adopted, will lead to an early and permanent
resolution of the crisis in Yemen.
