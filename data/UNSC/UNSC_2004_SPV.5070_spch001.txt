The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document 5/2004/830, which contains the text of a
note dated 21 October 2004 by the Secretary-General.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2004/879, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations. May I take it that the Council is
ready to proceed to take a decision on that draft
resolution?

There being no objection, it is so decided.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to adopt the draft resolution contained in document
S/2004/879 without a vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The draft resolution has been adopted as
resolution 1571 (2004).

The Security Council has thus concluded its
business for this meeting.

The meeting rose at 10.20 am.
