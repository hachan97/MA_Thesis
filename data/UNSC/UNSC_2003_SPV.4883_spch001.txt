The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the Charge d'affaires ad interim of Iraq in which he
requests that His Excellency Mr. Hoshyar Zebari,
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq, be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council and
as agreed in its prior consultations, to invite His
Excellency Mr. Hoshyar Zebari, Minister for Foreign
Affairs of Iraq, to participate in the discussion, without
the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

On behalf of the Council, I extend a warm
welcome to His Excellency Mr. Hoshyar Zebari,
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Zebari
(Iraq) took a seat at the Council table.

The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. Members of the Council have before them
the report of the Secretary-General (S/2003/ 1149)
pursuant to paragraph 24 of resolution 1483 (2003) and
paragraph 12 of resolution 1511 (2003). I should also
like to draw the attention of the members to the
following documents: letter dated 2 December 2003
from the President of the Security Council addressed to
the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of
Iraq to the United Nations (S/2003/1169); and letter
dated 11 December 2003 from the Charge d'affaires a.i.
of the Permanent Mission of Iraq to the United Nations
addressed to the President of the Security Council
(S/2003/1170).

I welcome the presence of the Secretary-General,
Mr. Kofi Annan, at this meeting, and I give him the
floor.
