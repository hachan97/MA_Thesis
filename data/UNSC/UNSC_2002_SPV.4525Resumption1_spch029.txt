The President: I thank the representative of
Lebanon for his kind words addressed to me.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is His
Excellency Mr. Ravan A. G. Farhadi, Vice-Chairman of
the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable
Rights of the Palestinian People, to whom the Council
has extended an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure. I invite him to take a
seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
