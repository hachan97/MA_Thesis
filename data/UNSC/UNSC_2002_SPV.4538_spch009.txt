The President: I thank the Assistant Secretary-
General for Political Affairs, Mr. Ibrahima Fall, for his
kind words addressed to my delegation.
I should like to announce that I will be happy to
give the floor to Council members who wish to respond
to comments made by non-members in the course of
the debate. I believe that that will make the debate both
more interactive and more interesting; indeed, it was
the wish of the African Group to hear the responses of
Council members. Therefore, after three or four non-
members have spoken, I shall be happy to give the
floor to any member who wishes to respond. For
example, the representative of France would like to
respond after the first four speakers have spoken. I
hope other Council members who wish to respond from
time to time will inform the Secretariat of the point at
which they wish to intervene.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Benin, who will speak as Chairman of
the African Group for the month of May. I invite him
to take a seat at the Council table and to make his
statement.
