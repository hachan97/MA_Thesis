Mr. Heumann (Israel): It is regrettable that I need
to take the floor for a second time today, but given some
of the statements that have been made, I feel obliged to
respond. I shall do so very quickly.

We heard today the Saudi representative address
my country. This representative, whose country was
just put on the blacklist as one of the worst violators
of children's rights, has the audacity to criticize my
country. Saudi Arabia is responsible for the killing and
maiming of more than 600 children in the past year,
and that has entitled it to be included on the list ofthose
parties who commit grave violations against children.
I warmly suggest to him that he make better use of
his time and, instead of attempting to divert attention
from his own country's crimes, that he develop a new
policy that would actually take the rights of children
into account and protect children from cruel and
indiscriminate attacks in Yemen.
