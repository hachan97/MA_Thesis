Mr. Mahugu (Kenya): We are encouraged by the
fact that one of the longest wars fought in this region is
finally coming to an end, and in this regard we welcome
the signing of the December accord. We are particularly
aware of the United Nations involvement in the peace
process in Guatemala and of how useful and successful
that involvement has been to date. The report of the
Secretary-General on the current status of the peace
process clearly sees a role for the United Nations in the
verification of the peace accords negotiated with its
assistance. Consequently, having considered the Secretary-
General's recommendations, my delegation is of the View
that increasing the strength of the United Nations Mission
for the Verification of Human Rights and of Compliance
with the Commitments of the Comprehensive Agreement
on Human Rights in Guatemala (MINUGUA) so as to
fulfil the additional verification functions entrusted to it
by the ceasefire agreement is crucial for its final
implementation.

In this regard, my delegation has noted the
Secretary-General's confirmation that the mechanism to
oversee the preparation of assembly points to receive the
Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG)
combatants have been put in place. We have also

 

observed that paragraph 16 of the report reaffirms the
desire of both parties to see the military aspects of the
peace settlement urgently implemented. Accordingly, we
strongly believe that the support of the international
community for the efforts of Guatemalans in their quest for
peace should be forthcoming and unequivocal and should
not be seen to waver at this critical stage. Kenya will
therefore vote in favour of the draft resolution.
