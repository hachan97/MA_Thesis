Mr. Cardi (Italy): Italy welcomes the unanimous
adoption of resolution 2372 (2017), which reauthorizes
the mandate of the African Union Mission in Somalia
(AMISOM).

We would like to thank the penholder, the
United Kingdom, for its excellent work on the text of
the resolution.

AMISOM. has been doing a tremendous job in
recent years. We wish to commend the African Union
and the troop- and police-contributing countries on
their efforts, and AMISOM. on the high price in human
lives it has paid for the cause. In the past month, the
Somali Government has achieved much progress, from
agreeing on the main principle of the national security
architecture to the security pact for the coordinated
development of the Somali security forces. The
new framework will require some time to be fully
operational.
In our View, the decision taken by the Security
Council to defer to October 2018 its consideration of
the further steps of the Mission's transition process
is therefore very wise. Because the threat posed by
Al-Shabaab remains very serious, the need to build
up the Somali security forces in an effective manner
retains all its strategic significance. At the same time,
resolution 2372 (2017) sets out the timeline upon which
the Council will speed up the shift from AMISOM
to the Somali security forces, with regard to primary
responsibility for security. The reconfiguration of the
Mission in favour of a more robust presence of police
personnel, as security conditions allow, will also prove
to be instrumental to that end.

For years, Italy has been advocating the added value
of AMISOM. and the Somali police to the stabilization
of Somalia. We therefore look forward to further
discussing that and other relevant matters pertaining
to Somalia, a country we will continue to be strongly
committed to, during the joint session the Security
Council and the African Union Peace and Security
Council will hold in Addis Ababa next week.
