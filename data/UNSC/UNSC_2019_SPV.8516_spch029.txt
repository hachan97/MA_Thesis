Ms. Mueller: I would like to respond to the question
posed by the Ambassador of Ukraine, which was
about how all the parties can contribute to alleviating
human suffering. I first want to implore all the parties
to immediately cease using landmines and work with
Mine Action Service partners to provide awareness to
civilians and plans for demining.

Secondly, I would like to call on the parties to the
conflict to take every possible precaution to prevent or
at least minimize civilian harm. International law must
be upheld by all the parties so as to protect civilians
and their access to critical services at all times. Very
concretely, I urge that the pedestrian bridge at Stanytsia
Luhanska be rebuilt and also that the conditions at the
bridge be improved to enable speedy passage across
it, in particular for the elderly, who desperately need
access to their pensions and to health services.

Finally, humanitarian assistance should not be
politicized. Humanitarian assistance is provided based
on the universally recognized principles of humanity,
impartiality, neutrality and independence.
