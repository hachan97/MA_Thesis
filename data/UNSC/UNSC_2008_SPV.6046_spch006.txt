Mr. Hoang Chi Trung (Viet Nam): We too have
the honour to give an explanation of our vote. We have
voted in favour of the resolution on the basis of the
request made to the Security Council by Somalia with
respect to support for the countries of the region in
efforts to suppress piracy in the waters off the coast of
Somalia.

We wish to reaffirm that the resolution is aimed
at ensuring respect for the sovereignty, territorial
integrity, political independence and unity of Somalia
and promoting safe and uninterrupted maritime
navigation in the area. The measures taken under the
resolution must be consistent with relevant
international treaties and must not be considered as
establishing customary international law.
