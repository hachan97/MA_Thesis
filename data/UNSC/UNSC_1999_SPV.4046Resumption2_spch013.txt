The President: It is my understanding that the
Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft
resolution before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall
put the draft resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:

Argentina, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, China, France,
Gabon, Gambia, Malaysia, Namibia, Netherlands,
Russian Federation, Slovenia, United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of

The President: There were 15 votes in favour. The
draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1265 (1999).
 

There are no further speakers inscribed on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
