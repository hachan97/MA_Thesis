Mr. Yepez Lasso (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish):
Ecuador is a peace-loving country that bases its foreign
policy on the strictest compliance with the principles
and norms of international public law, which are
clearly and precisely articulated in the Charter of the
United Nations. Therefore, my country firmly defends
the binding nature of the principle of the peaceful
settlement of disputes and the proscription of the use of
force in international relations, except in cases
envisaged in the San Francisco Charter itself. Ecuador
has always supported the Security Council's
jurisdiction over the maintenance of international peace
and security. All of its resolutions must be respected by
the parties, and it is incumbent upon the Council to
ensure their full implementation.

Therefore, Ecuador urges the Government of Iraq
to cooperate fully in the effective implementation of
Security Council resolution 1441 (2002). In that
context, the United Nations inspectors should continue
their work until they complete the process aimed at the
peaceful, transparent and verifiable disarmament of
Iraq, and should submit the relevant reports for the
Council's consideration and for its decision.

The situation concerning Iraq must be addressed
in conformity with the norms of international law,
primarily those contained in Chapter VII of the
Charter. Only the Security Council - when the facts
and circumstances so require - will thus be able to
determine whether or not there are grounds to use force
through an explicit resolution that would set forth the
conditions for the use of force, if appropriate.

Ecuador believes in peace and in law. The
international legal order established after the Second
World War is being tested. My country urges that it
remain fully in force and that multilateral cooperation
be strengthened in order to build a more secure and just
world in greater solidarity.
