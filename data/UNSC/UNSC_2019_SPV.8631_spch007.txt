Mr. Yao Shaojun (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
appreciates the seriousness of the problem of illegal
migration in the Mediterranean and hopes that the
countries concerned and organizations of the region will
come up with more effective solutions to it. Accordingly,
China voted in favour ofthe Security Council's adoption
today of resolution 2491 (2019). We hope that Member
States will implement it and the previous relevant
resolutions carefully and comprehensively, with a view
to enabling a full and appropriate solution to the issue.
As the resolution requests, the Secretary-General will
submit a progress report to the Council in April 2020.
Given the important developments in the situation in
the region since the adoption of resolution 2240 (2015),
we expect the Secretary-General's report to contain
information on the progress of relevant operations and
that the Council will then comprehensively review the
implementation of resolution 2491 (2019) in the light of
developments on the ground.

Addressing illegal migration requires that we
address both its symptoms and root causes by adopting
a holistic approach and focusing on resolving the
underlying issues, including extreme poverty, social
turmoil and armed conflicts. China hopes that the
international community will engage in helping
migrants' countries of origin achieve peace and
stability, promote economic and social development and
consolidate peace and stability through development
in order to find a lasting solution to this issue. China
is ready to continue to work with other countries to
find a proper solution and to maintain regional peace
and stability.
