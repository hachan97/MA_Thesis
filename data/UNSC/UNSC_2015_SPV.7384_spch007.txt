Mr. Barros Melet (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): Chile
joined the international community's recognition of the
contact group's diplomatic efforts, which have led to
the agreement on a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine. We are
confident that it will contribute to ending the violence
and the humanitarian crisis in the country by providing
assistance through an international mechanism.

Resolution 2202 (2015), which we have just
adopted, is clear sign of consensus in support of those
diplomatic efforts and of the ceasefire for the benefit
of the protection of civilians. We view very positively
the inclusion of the reference to resolution 2166 (2014)
in the adopted text. We are confident that the measures
set forth in the 13 points of the agreement reached at the
Minsk summit on 12 February will be implemented by
all parties for the benefit of the population that has been
affected by the crisis.

We emphasize the need to respect the independence,
territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. We
call on all parties to fully comply with the provisions
of the ceasefire in order to guarantee that a sustainable
political solution is agreed that ensures peaceful
coexistence based on the principles of international law
and the Charter of the United Nations, thereby building
lasting peace.
