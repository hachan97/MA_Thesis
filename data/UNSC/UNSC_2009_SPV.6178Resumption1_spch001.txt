The President: I would like to inform the
Council that in addition to the list of countries that I
mentioned this morning, I have received letters from
the representatives of Nepal and the Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela in which they request to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In accordance with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
consideration without the right to vote in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, the
representatives of the aforementioned countries
took the seats reservedfor them at the side of the
Council Chamber

The President: I would like to remind all
speakers to limit their statements to no more than five
minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its
work expeditiously.

I now give the floor to the Permanent
Representative of Morocco.
