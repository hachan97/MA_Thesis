The President (spoke in French): In response to
the requests of Austria, Canada, the Netherlands,
Nigeria and the Sudan, I understand that the Council
has agreed to extend invitations to those
representatives, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure, to participate in the
consideration of the item without the right to vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

In response to the request of Qatar, I shall take it
that the Security Council has agreed to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to His Excellency Mr. Yahya Mahmassani,
Permanent Observer of the League of Arab States to
the United Nations.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

I wish to welcome all the Ministers and
participants at this meeting.

I now invite the Secretary-General, His
Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, to take the floor.
