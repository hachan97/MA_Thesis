The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as the representative of Poland.

At the outset, let me thank the Special Coordinator,
Mr. Mladenov, for his account of the latest developments
on the ground. Poland condemns in the strongest terms
the rocket attacks targeting the civilian communities
in southern Israel, carried out by militant groups from
the Gaza Strip. There is no justification under any
circumstances for indiscriminate and deliberate acts
of Violence against the civilian population. They are
unacceptable. They must stop and never be repeated
again. Both Israelis and Palestinians have a right to live
in peace and safety.

We concur with Special Coordinator Mladenov
that such attacks undermine the efforts to improve
the situation in Gaza. We strongly urge the parties to
exercise the utmost restraint and to refrain from any
actions that may lead to a further escalation of the
situation and may endanger the safety of civilians.

We call upon all actors to ensure the protection
of civilians, particularly children. In that respect, we
reiterate our appeal to all parties to strictly comply with
their obligations under international humanitarian law
and human rights law.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

I give the floor to the Permanent Observer of the
Observer State of Palestine.
