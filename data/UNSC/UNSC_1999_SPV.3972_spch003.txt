The President (interpretation from Spanish): It is my
understanding that the Security Council is ready to proceed
to the vote on the draft resolution (S/ 1999/79) before it. If
I hear no objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the
vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Argentina, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, China, France,
Gabon, Gambia, Malaysia, Namibia, Netherlands,
Russian Federation, Slovenia, United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of
America

The President (interpretation from Spanish): There
were 15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 1225 (1999).

There are no further speakers inscribed on my list.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage

of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 12.10 p.m.
