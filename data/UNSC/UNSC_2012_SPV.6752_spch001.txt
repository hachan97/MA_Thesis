The President: The Security Council will now

begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

After consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the

following statement on their behalf:

"The Security Council strongly condemns
the 13 April 2012 (local time) launch by the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

"The Security Council underscores that this
satellite launch, as well as any launch that uses
ballistic missile technology, even if characterized
as a satellite launch or space launch vehicle, is a
serious violation of Security Council resolutions
1718 (2006) and 1874 (2009).

"The Security Council deplores that such a
launch has caused grave security concerns in the
region.

"The Security Council demands that the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea not
proceed with any further launches using ballistic
missile technology and comply with resolutions
1718 (2006) and 1874 (2009) by suspending all
activities related to its ballistic missile
programme and in this context re-establish its
pre-existing commitments to a moratorium on
missile launches.

"The Security Council agrees to adjust the
measures imposed by paragraph 8 of resolution
1718 (2006), as modified by resolution 1874
(2009). The Security Council directs the
Committee established pursuant to resolution
1718 (2006) to undertake the following tasks and
the

to report to the Security Council within 15 days:
(a) designate additional entities and items;
(b) update the information contained on the
Committee's list of individuals, entities and items
(S/2009/2005 and INFCIRC/254/Rev.9/Part 1),
and update on an annual basis thereafter; and
(c) update the Committee's annual work plan.

"The Security Council further agrees that, if
the Committee has not acted pursuant to the
paragraph above within 15 days, then the Security
Council will complete action to adjust these
measures within an additional five days.

"The Security Council demands that the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea
immediately comply fully with its obligations
under Security Council resolutions 1718 (2006)
and 1874 (2009), including that it abandon all
nuclear weapons and existing nuclear
programmes in a complete, verifiable and
irreversible manner; immediately cease all related
activities; and not conduct any further launches
that use ballistic missile technology, nuclear tests
or any further provocation.

"The Security Council calls upon all
Member States to implement fully their
obligations pursuant to resolutions 1718 (2006)
and 1874 (2009).

"The Security Council expresses its
determination to take action accordingly in the
event of a further Democratic People's Republic
of Korea launch or nuclear test."

This statement will be issued as a document of
Security Council under the symbol

S/PRST/2012/13.

The Security Council has thus concluded the

present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
