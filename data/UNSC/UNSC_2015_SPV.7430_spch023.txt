The President: I would remind all speakers to
ensure that their statements do not exceed four minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its business
in a timely, efficient and expeditious manner. I would
request that delegations with lengthy statements
distribute those texts in the Chamber and speak within
the allotted four-minute time frame. I would also
request that speakers bear in mind that the speed of
delivery of statements needs to be reasonable so that
interpreters can follow them. I also wish to inform
everyone concerned that, as we have a large number
of speakers, we will proceed with today's open debate
through the lunch hour.

(spoke in Arabic)

I now give the floor to the representative of
Lebanon.
