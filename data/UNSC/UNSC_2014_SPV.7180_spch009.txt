Mr. Omaish (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): Today,
Jordan voted in favour of draft resolution S/2014/348
based on our deep conviction regarding the principles
of criminal justice and the need for criminal
accountability, in an attempt to put an end to the policy
of impunity pursued since the beginning of the Syrian
crisis and based on our belief in the principles of the
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. We
would like to express our deep regret that the Council
was unable to adopt the draft resolution today.

At the same time, we would like to emphasize our
support for the French initiative, which is designed to
limit the use of the veto when the Security Council is
voting on draft resolutions related to the perpetration of
genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, in
order to avoid a repetition of what we have seen today.
