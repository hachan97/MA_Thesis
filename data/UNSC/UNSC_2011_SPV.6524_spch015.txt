Mr. Amieyeofori (Nigeria): 1, too, would like to
thank Under-Secretary-General Pascoe for his
comprehensive and insightful briefing on the situation
in Syria.

Nigeria shares the concerns of most delegations on
the widespread violence that has engulfed Syria since
late March and led to hundreds of deaths and injuries.
We call for an end to the violence and bloodshed and
urge all the parties to maintain calm and restraint.

In these circumstances, we want to reiterate the
importance of the protection of civilians, respect for
human rights and the need to uphold the right to
peaceful assembly. The lifting of the 48-year old
emergency law and the programme of reforms
announced by the Government, although long overdue,
are steps in the right direction. We therefore encourage
the Government of Syria to consolidate this process
and to swiftly implement these measures.

In our view, resolving the Syrian crisis, as most
speakers have noted, requires some measure of caution,
as this crisis could negatively affect regional peace and
security.

Finally, we call for an inclusive dialogue and
genuine reforms that address the legitimate concerns
and aspirations of the Syrian people, including a
democratization process that will promote peace and
stability in the country. In this regard, we welcome the
statement issued by the League of Arab States. Our
view is that the Arab League has an important role to
play in the efforts to resolve the Syrian crisis. We urge
the Syrian authorities to provide access for
international aid and assistance to those in need of care
and drugs in order to halt the deteriorating situation in
the country.
