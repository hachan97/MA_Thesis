The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the
representative of the United States for the kind words
he addressed to me.

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Cesar
Gaviria, Secretary General of the Organization of
American States, for three minutes so that he may
respond to the comments and questions raised by the
representatives of Chile and of the United States.
