The President (Spoke in French): As we agreed
in consultations, we shall vote on the draft resolution
on the basis of the English text, which is before us. The
draft resolution will be circulated in blue very shortly,
but I would like to know whether members are
prepared to vote on the basis of the document that is
now before them. I see this is the case.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2002/1063, which contains the text of a
draft resolution presented by Bulgaria, France, Ireland,
Norway and the United Kingdom. It is my
understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to
the vote on the draft resolution before it. IfI hear no
objection, I shall now put the draft resolution to the
vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by Show of hands.

Infavour:
Bulgaria, Cameroon, China, Colombia, France,
Guinea, Ireland, Mauritius, Mexico, Norway,
Russian Federation, Singapore, Syrian Arab
Republic, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland

Abstaining:
United States of America

The President (spoke in French): The result of
the voting is as follows: 14 votes in favour, none
against and 1 abstention. The draft resolution has been
adopted as resolution 1435 (2002).

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
