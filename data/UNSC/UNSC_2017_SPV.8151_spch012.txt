Mr. Yelehenko (Ukraine): Ukraine welcomes
the unanimous adoption of resolution 2397 (2017),
which designates additional individuals and entities
for inclusion on the relevant control lists, as well as
strengthening prohibitions and restrictions, in response
to the continuous provocations by the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea. Indeed, to date,
Pyongyang's policy continues to be very persistent and
clear in ignoring international law and the numerous
calls to halt its illegal activity. Besides nuclear tests
and missile launches, there is also an intricate system
of sanctions evasion in place.

Today's resolution not only strengthens the already
existing sanctions regime by imposing additional
sectoral and targeted measures. It also clearly proves
that the Council remains united and decisive in its
response to the growing nuclear threat on the Korean
peninsula. On the other hand, the resolution confirms
the Council's openness to dialogue on a peaceful
and diplomatic solution to the situation in the region
and its intention to avoid affecting the North Korean
population. We believe that our message today must be
heard by the North Korean leadership.

I also wish to reiterate the key importance of the
full and comprehensive implementation of all Security
Council resolutions related to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea by all Member States. Joint actions
are needed to change Pyongyang's reckless behaviour.
A united and uncompromising stance at the global level
is crucial to prevent the risk of further provocations
and to preserve the nuclear non-proliferation regime as
a whole.

Finally, let me underline that Ukraine voted in
favour of the resolution in the belief that any responsible
member of the international community must spare no
effort in restoring respect for international law and in
finding solutions to counter the greatest threat to global
peace and security.
