Mr. Aboulatta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the
outset, I should like to thank the Japanese delegation
for submitting draft resolution S/2017/970 today.

As we reiterated yesterday (see S/PV.8105),
experience has proved throughout the existence of the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-
United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM)
that there is an urgent need to improve its working
methods, in particular by conducting field visits to
the sites where the use of chemical weapons is being
investigated - including the inspection, recording
and collection of evidence and samples in a timely
fashion - and by considering all potential scenarios
relating to the use of chemical weapons. Egypt has tried
to ensure that any draft resolution of the Security Council
on the extension of the JIM. mandate would guarantee
these measures without delving into technicalities that
would undermine the implementation or independence
of the Mechanism, and in a way that would provide a
solid and sound foundation for its conclusions.

In line with the position that we have expressed
previously and reiterated yesterday in explaining our
abstention in the voting on the two draft resolutions
that were before us, and also in line with our resolve
to guard against the recurrent use of chemical weapons
against our brethren in Syria and the need to identify
the perpetrators of earlier crimes, we supported the
Japanese draft today because it provides an opportunity
to maintain that international tool, open broad prospects
for the restructuring and development of the working
methods of the Mechanism, and promote its credibility
and the independence of its investigations.
We therefore express our regret that the Council
could not adopt the draft resolution today and deplore
the lack of trust among its members. However, we
reiterate that we remain willing to work with our
partners in the Security Council in the remaining
weeks of our membership to consider any alternative
that would achieve the purposes of the JIM. in Syria.
