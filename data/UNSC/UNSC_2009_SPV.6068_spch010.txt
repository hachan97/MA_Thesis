Mr. Tiendrebeogo (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French): We should like to join you, Mr. President, in
paying tribute to Ambassador Khalilzad and in
expressing our good Wishes for his future endeavours.

With respect to the resolution that we have just
adopted, we would like to thank the delegation of the
United States of America for its leadership in the
preparation and negotiation of the draft. Burkina Faso
would also like to thank the members of the Security
Council, who agreed to adopt the resolution
unanimously.

For some time now the Council has been facing a
dilemma in Somalia: how to act effectively in a
situation of chaos. At the same time, is it not precisely
because there is chaos that our action is necessary?
With the present resolution, the Council is laying an
important milestone on the road to establishing a
peacekeeping operation. Burkina Faso chose to support
the resolution even though we had hoped it would
express a firmer commitment on the part of the Council
beyond the intention currently expressed in the text.
We believe nonetheless that the resolution will make it
possible to support more fully the dynamic of the
political process under way, because it takes into
account certain recommendations of the African Union,
specifically those related to strengthening the African
Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM) and the
deployment of a peacekeeping operation.
We look forward to studying the report of the
Secretary-General and also hope that the Council can
quickly come to a firm decision to establish an
operation. For the time being, we invite donors to
contribute to the special trust fund created to support
the efforts ofAMISOM.

We take this opportunity to reiterate our gratitude
to the troops of Uganda and Burundi involved in
AMISOM. and our support for the mission of
Mr. Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, Special Representative
of the Secretary-General for Somalia.
