Mr. Fernandez-Arias Minuesa (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): Spain supported and co-sponsored resolution
2220 (2015) and thanks the delegation of Lithuania
for presenting it and for its tireless work leading to
the adoption of a timely and positive text. The text
is a good complement to resolution 2117 (2013) and
keeps the issue on the Security Council's agenda. We
view positively the references to the control of arms
transfers to terrorist groups and criminal networks,
to the protection of civilians and to issues of women
and peace and security. We also see as very timely
references to the Arms Trade Treaty, which is and has
been the most important step taken in disarmament in
recent years.

The resolution incorporates practical measures
aimed at improving the control of the illicit arms
trafficking, management, stockpiling and proper
destruction of stockpiles. We have see the image of the
soldier laying down his rifle contained in the tapestry
hanging in this Chamber as symbolic of the Security
Council's work in the fight to free the world from the
threat of weapons, specifically small arms and light
weapons. We have taken a step in that direction today.
