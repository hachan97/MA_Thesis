The President (spoke in Spanish): I would like
to remind all speakers that they should limit their
statements to a maximum of four minutes, so that the
Security Council can carry out its work expeditiously.
I would therefore ask all delegations wishing to make
lengthy statements to be kind enough to distribute their
texts in writing and to present orally in the Chamber an
abbreviated version of their comments.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Kyrgyzstan.
