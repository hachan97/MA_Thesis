Mr. Urbina (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): I
wish to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Pascoe and
Mr. Mulet for their briefings this afternoon, and to
thank the representative of Georgia for being here with
us.

Eight days ago, on Monday, 11 August, I made a
statement here in which I briefly summarized
Costa Rica's position on this matter. Today I am taking
the floor again to say that, in our view, the situation in
Georgia is not a European problem; nor is it a problem
that involves only the great economic and military
Powers. Costa Rica firmly believes that this is a crisis
in which small States that are not major economic or
military Powers also have a stake. We are the majority
in this Organization. Costa Rica wishes once again to
emphasize the need to restore the position and
observance of international law, which guarantees the
security of small countries.

We share the concerns raised by the failure to
comply with commitments, in particular because those
commitments were agreed upon by the parties as steps
necessary to normalize the situation in Georgia. We
welcome humanitarian action from any quarter,
because it eases the situation of a civilian population
that has been the victim of politically motivated
hostilities.
