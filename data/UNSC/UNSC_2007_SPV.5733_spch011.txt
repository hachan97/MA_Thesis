Mr. Shcherbak (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation welcomes today's
unanimous adoption of resolution 1773 (2007), which
extends for another year the mandate of the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). We feel
that its adoption is a great step towards strengthening
the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon. We
are grateful to the peacekeepers for the stabilizing role
they are playing in Lebanon, maintaining peace and
security in that country.

At the same time, we feel that the resolution is a
compromised text and that other issues that were raised
here today in the statements by our colleagues, in
particular the question of weapons smuggling, do not
relate to the text that we have just adopted. We could
also continue the list of problems, as we indicated in
our discussions on the resolution, including as regards
cluster bombs.

In conclusion, we would like to once again stress
our delegation's gratitude for the unanimous adoption
of this resolution.
