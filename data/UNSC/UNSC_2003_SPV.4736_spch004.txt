Mr. Cunningham (United States of America):
My thanks go to Mr. Morris. That was really a superb
presentation on this very, very difficult situation. I
want to thank him also for his hard work and his
organization's hard work in trying to deal with it.

Unfortunately, Mr. Morris has outlined the
elements of an emergency that force us to deal with the
short term and with chronic cases. In his comments he
pointed to many of the other elements that make this
even more intractable: man-made complications, the
politicization of food, the effects of war. We join Mr.
Morris in opposing food being used as a weapon, and
we are particularly alarmed at the impact of
HIV/AIDS, for many of the reasons he described.

What I wanted to ask Mr. Morris is, given all this,
what has been his most recent message to donors on the
crisis? What have the responses been and what does he
assess to be the unmet needs still before us in 2003?
