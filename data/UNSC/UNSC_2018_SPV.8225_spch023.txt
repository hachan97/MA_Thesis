Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I apologize for
taking the floor again, but I want to clarify something.
The Russian Ambassador's English is far too good for
him not to have understood me when I spoke on 5 April
(see S/PV.8224). The investigation of the Salisbury
incident that is under way is an independent police
investigation, and the United Kingdom will be very
pleased to update the Council as and when we have
something to say.

If I may, I would like to add one more thing.
The other difference between Salisbury and Syria is
that the United Kingdom is a party to the Chemical
Weapons Convention in good standing, and the Syrian
Government has not complied with its obligations as
certified by the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons.
