Mr. Adoum (Chad) (spoke in French): I wish at
the outset to express the gratitude of the Government
of Chad for the visit undertaken by Security Council
members to N'djamena and Chad. On behalf of the
Government of Chad, I also thank Council members, in
particular Ambassador De La Sabliere, for their kind
words concerning the welcome they received in Chad.

I shall be very brief, as I do not wish in any way
to open a debate at this meeting, Whose purpose is to
present the report of the Security Council's mission.
However, I would simply point out that we shall
respond in due time to the accusations and remarks
made by my colleague from the Sudan, and provide
evidence to refute his statements.

I should also like vigorously to recall and to
stress the importance that the Government of Chad
attaches to my letter of 14 June addressed to you,
Madam. We feel that the contents and tone of the letter
merit particular attention with regard to the stability
and security of our country. At the appropriate time,
the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Chad intends to
come to New York to address the Security Council on
this matter. I shall therefore say no more.
