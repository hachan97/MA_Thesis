Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I want to respond
to the unwarranted and intemperate comments of the
Syrian Permanent Representative against Germany and
the German Ambassador. I want to stress that Germany
is our partner and our ally in Europe, the European
Union and NATO, at the United Nations and throughout
the world. Germany makes a major contribution to the
work of the United Nations. It is the second-largest
contributor to the United Nations and it upholds the
values of the Charter of the United Nations.

We all know that the United Nations was founded
out of the ashes of the Second World War and we all
know what events led up to that war and its outcome.
It is true that Syria was a founding Member of the
United Nations, and that is a matter for all countries to
be proud of. But as many millions of ordinary citizens
in Syria know to their cost, Syrian authorities do not
uphold the values of the Charter of the United Nations,
they do not uphold the Chemical Weapons Convention,
and they have tortured and starved their own people.
If there is any threat to the values of the Charter of the
United Nations, it comes from Syria and not from any
member of the Security Council today.
