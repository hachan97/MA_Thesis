Ms. Tachco (United States ofAmerica): The United
States wishes to thank Cote d'Ivoire for its steadfast
work as penholder for resolution 2404 (2018), and we
also wish to thank our fellow Council members for their
collaboration during the negotiations.

The United States believes that the resolution we
have just adopted will bring about a real improvement
to the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office
in Guinea-Bissau. With a streamlined mandate, the
mission can focus even more on its good offices to
help deliver an end to the stalemate that has not only
frustrated the Council but, more importantly, has hurt
the citizens of Guinea-Bissau for far too long.

That stalemate was created out of selfishness and
intransigence. We again call on President Vaz, Prime
Minister Da Silva, the leader of the Parti africain
pour l'independance de la Guinee et de Cabo Verde,
Mr. Pereira, and others in the Guinea-Bissau leadership
to work together for the sake of their people and forge
consensus to get Government working again. Guinea-
Bissau's leaders have had many chances to fix the
Government gridlock since the Conakry Agreement
was signed in October 2016. They have ignored
those chances and taken actions that purposefully
contradicted the Agreement.

The bold move taken by the Economic Community
of West African States' (ECOWAS) to push those
impeding the process through targeted sanctions comes
from a desire to induce them to become part of the
solution instead. As it did in The Gambia, ECOWAS
is proving to be an example for regional organizations
everywhere in its willingness to take significant
challenging steps to improve lives across West
Africa. As I said in the Chamber two weeks ago (see S/PV.8182), time is running out and our patience has
expired. Guinea-Bissau's leaders must make this time
different, and come out and do what is right.
