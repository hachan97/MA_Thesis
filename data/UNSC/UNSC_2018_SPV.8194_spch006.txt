Mr. Polyanskiy (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation supportedthe adoption
of resolution 2404 (2018), extending the mandate of
the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in
Guinea-Bissau. In taking that decision, we were guided
by the importance of maintaining consensus within the
Security Council. We also took into account the hopes
expressed by our African partners.

In that regard, we wish to stress that the
acknowledgment contained in the document of
instances of restrictions imposed by the Economic
Community of West African States on a number of
Guinea-Bissau actors does not signify their approval by
the Council. Once again, we note the fact that the only
legitimate international sanctions are those imposed by
the Security Council, in line with Chapter VII of the
Charter of the United Nations. We object to any attempt,
through the Council, to introduce wording that would
distort that fundamental principle in international law
or use it to legitimize unilateral restrictions, regardless
of any noble intentions that may be advanced.

Our approach to the matter is well known. Unilateral
sanctions, especially those imposed in addition to
measures already agreed by the Security Council, are
a path to nowhere. Not only do they not help to resolve
crises but, as practice shows, they only serve to further
escalate them.
