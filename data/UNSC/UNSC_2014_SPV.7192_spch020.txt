Mr. Oh Joon (Republic of Korea): I would like to
thank the Russian presidency for holding this important
meeting. I would like to also thank the Presidents and
Prosecutors of the International Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the International
Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals for their
respective briefings.

The Republic of Korea appreciates and supports
the efforts of the ICTY and the ICTR and the smooth
transitioning activities of the Mechanism. We note
that, as of now, 161 cases have been handled by the
ICTY and 93 by the ICTR. We encourage the correct
understanding of ensuring due process and fairness
in prosecutions and trials. However, in some cases it
has taken longer than expected for the defendant to be
indicted and judged, such as in the Mladie and Butare
cases. We would like to stress the importance of speedy
completion by quoting the legal maxim: "Justice
delayed is justice denied".

We would also like to reiterate the importance
of the residual work, such as the nine fugitive cases,
contempt and false testimony cases, victims and
witness protection and record archiving. To fulfil
those mandates, mutual assistance and international
cooperation are crucial. We also support resolution
2150 (2014), which calls upon all States to cooperate
with the Mechanism in the arrest and prosecution of the
remaining fugitives.

In transitioning to the Mechanism, we believe
that the Presidents and the Registrars need to focus
on the staff's sustainability. The rich legacy of those
international criminaljustice bodies has to be preserved
for prosperity. The ICTY, ICTR and the Mechanism
are and will remain symbols of the international
commitment to the fight against impunity and the
milestone of reconciliation.
