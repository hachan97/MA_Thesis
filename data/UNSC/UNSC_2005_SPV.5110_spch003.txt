The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Mr. VaIdes for his kind and undeserved words
addressed to me.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I remind all speakers to limit
their statements to no more than five minutes so that
the Council may carry out its work expeditiously.
Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to circulate their texts in writing and to
deliver condensed versions when speaking in the
Chamber.

I now give the floor to the Minister for Foreign
Affairs of Haiti.
