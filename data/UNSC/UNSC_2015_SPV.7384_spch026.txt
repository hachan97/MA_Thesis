Mr. Sergeyev (Ukraine) (spoke in Russian): What
has been called the unification of Crimea should really
be called occupation and annexation following an
aggressive attack. We shall discuss that further.

What was said about humanitarian convoys
is a challenge to international law, which defines
arrangements for supplies of humanitarian assistance
to a second country. In today's statement by the
representative of Russia, international law was once
again trampled all over. They have their law and they
know how to use it.

As to a constitution, we reject anything that smacks
of Russian interference. Russia has been trying to tell
us how we should develop and what our constitutional
order should be 4 what the next Constitution should
look like. Everything was clearly stated to our people.

With regard to the eastern regions, as well as
elsewhere, work is under way on decentralization and
expanding the powers of local authorities.

Therefore, once again, I ask that Russia not interfere
in our affairs. We will decide for ourselves how to live,
what to build and how to establish dialogue with our
own people.
