Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): The
United Kingdom welcomes the adoption of resolution
2140 (2014), on Yemen. By its unanimous adoption of
the resolution, the Security Council has delivered four
clear messages.

First, the international community continues to
focus on Yemen and wants to support the Yemeni people
towards a more stable and prosperous future. More
support is needed to help the Yemeni Government to
improve security and provide humanitarian assistance.

Secondly, the next steps in the transition are
clear. Those are constitutional electoral reform,
followed by elections. All constituencies must work
together to implement the recommendations of the
National Dialogue Conference. That includes the
recommendation of the report of the good governance
working group on who can hold future high office.

Thirdly, those wishing to derail the political
transition will face swift and firm consequences through
the new Sanctions Committee. The resolution is clear:
"the transition process requires turning the page from
the presidency of Ali Abdullah Saleh" (resolution 2140 (2014), fourteenth preambular paragraph).

Fourthly, when the Council works together and
delivers tough messages, it can create the catalyst for
change.

I would like to end by taking this opportunity to
commend the continued efforts of Special Adviser of
the Secretary-General Jamal Benomar and of the Gulf
Cooperation Council to assist Yemen through that
transition process.
