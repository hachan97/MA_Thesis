The President (spoke in Russian): As this is the
first meeting of the Security Council for the month of
November, I should like to take this opportunity to pay
tribute, on behalf of the Council, to Mr. Mihnea Ioan
Motoc, Permanent Representative of Romania to the
United Nations, for his service as President of the
Security Council for the month of October. He is
currently in Africa, but we all recall the excellent work
done by him personally and the entire Romanian
delegation. I am sure I speak for all members of the
Council in expressing deep appreciation to
Ambassador Motoc for the great diplomatic skill with
which he conducted the Council's business last month.

Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.

Election of five members of the International Court
of Justice (S/2005/446, S/2005/447 and Corr.1 and S/2005/448 and Corr.1)

The President (spoke in Russian): The Security
Council will now proceed to the election of five
members of the International Court of Justice, in
accordance with Article 13 of the Statute of the
International Court of Justice, to fill the five seats
which will become vacant on 5 February 2006 on the
expiry of the terms of office of the following Judges:
Mr. Vladlen S. Vereshchetin (Russian Federation),
Mr. Pieter H. Kooijmans (Netherlands), Mr. Francisco
Rezek (Brazil), Mr. Thomas Buergenthal (United States of America) and Mr. Nabil Elaraby (Egypt).

The list of candidates nominated by national
groups is contained in documents S/2005/447,
S/2005/447/Add.1 and S/2005/447/Corr.1.

I should like to inform the members of the
Council that I have received a letter addressed to me by
the Legal Counsel, dated 2 November 2005, in which
he informs me, on behalf of the Secretary-General, that
after the established deadline for the filing of
nominations, namely, 30 June 2005, several national
groups submitted nominations to the Secretariat. I
should also like to draw members' attention to the fact
that all such additional nominations relate to
candidates already nominated by other national groups,
whose names therefore already appear in document
S/2005/447 and S/2005/447/Corr.l. The Legal Counsel
recommended that, in accordance with established
practice, I inform Council members orally on the day
of the election about the decisions of the national
groups I have just mentioned. I am also informed that
the Legal Counsel made a similar recommendation to
the President of the General Assembly.

The nominations made by the national groups to
which I have referred are as follows: for Mr. Mohamed
Bennouna, Argentina and Jordan; for Mr. Thomas
Buergenthal, Germany, New Zealand, Peru and
Romania; for Mr. Julio D. Gonzalez Campos,
Argentina; for Mr. Kenneth Keith, Germany,
Luxembourg and Papua New Guinea; for Mr. Bernardo
Sepulveda Amor, Argentina, the Netherlands, Poland
and Romania; and for Mr. Leonid Skotnikov, Germany
and Romania.

The Security Council has before it a note by the
Secretary-General dated 3 November 2005, contained
in document S/2005/447/Add.l. Therein, the Secretary-
General notes that, by a letter dated 3 November 2005,
the representative of Niger informed the Legal Counsel
that the national group of Niger had decided to
withdraw its nomination of Mr. Seidou Adamou Mazou
for election to the International Court of Justice. Since
Mr. Mazou was nominated only by the national group
of Niger, his name does not appear on the ballot
papers.

The Security Council also has before it a
memorandum by the Secretary-General contained in
document S/2005/446, describing the present
composition of the Court and setting out the procedure
to be followed in the conduct of the election.

I should like to remind the Council that, under
Article 10, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the
International Court of Justice,

"Those candidates who obtain an absolute
majority of votes in the General Assembly and in
the Security Council shall be considered as
elected."

The required majority in the Security Council is
eight votes.

If, in the first ballot, the number of candidates
obtaining an absolute majority is less than five, then,
pursuant to rule 61 of the provisional rules of
procedure of the Security Council, the Council will
proceed to a second ballot on the remaining vacancies.
Balloting will then continue in the same manner until
five candidates have obtained the required majority of
votes.
If, on the other hand, more than five candidates
obtain the required majority, according to past practice
and as set forth in paragraph 13 of the Secretary-
General's memorandum, a new vote will be held on all
the candidates. That rule will also apply to any
subsequent ballots if the number of candidates
obtaining the absolute majority is greater than the
number of vacancies remaining.

The voting will be held by secret ballot. When we
proceed to the vote, members of the Council will
receive a ballot paper containing the names of all the
candidates. In that connection, I should like to offer
one slight clarification.

Members have before them document
S/2005/447, which contains a note by the Secretary-
General entitled "List of candidates nominated by
national groups". I wish to point out to members of the
Council that two candidates share the same surname,
namely, Mr. Bernardo Sepulveda Amor, Mexico's
candidate, and Mr. Abdelfattah Amor, Tunisia's
candidate. In order to avoid any confusion, Mexico's
candidate has requested that he appear as Mr. Bernardo
Sepulveda in the ballot to be distributed to members.
No such request was made by Tunisia's candidate; his
name will therefore appear as Mr. Abdelfattah Amor. I
hope that serves to clarify matters.

No withdrawal will be accepted once ballot
papers have been distributed. However, it would be
possible to withdraw between ballots. Members of the
Council will be requested to place an "X" in the boxes
next to the names of the candidates for whom they
wish to vote. Only those candidates whose names
appear on the ballot paper are eligible for election.

I should like to remind members of paragraph 10
of the Secretary-General's memorandum (S/2005/446),
which specifies that "Each elector may vote for not
more than five candidates on the first ballot". Any
ballot paper containing votes for more than five names
will be considered invalid. When five candidates have
obtained the required majority of votes, I shall
communicate the result of the election to the President
of the General Assembly, and I shall request the
Council to remain in session, pending the receipt from
the President of the General Assembly of the result of
the voting in the Assembly.

The Council will now proceed to draw lots to
select two delegations to serve as tellers. As one of the
candidates for election the Court is of Russian
nationality, I shall defer to the representative of
Romania, which held the presidency during the month
of October, to draw lots.

>l<>l<>l<

The President (spoke in Russian): The names of
the delegations of Algeria and the United Republic of
Tanzania have been drawn. I request them each to
appoint one of their members to serve as teller.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Hadj Ali
(Algeria) and Mrs. Taj (United Republic of Tanzania) acted as tellers.


The President (spoke in Russian): May I take it
that the Council is now ready to proceed with the
election of five members of the International Court of
Justice?

It is so decided.

I request the Conference Officer to distribute the
ballot papers.

Members of the Council should place an "X" in
the boxes next to the names of the five candidates for
whom they wish to vote.

>k>l<>l<


The President (spoke in Russian): I take it that
all the members of the Council have now voted, and I
ask the Conference Officer to collect the ballot papers.

>l<>l<>l<


The President (spoke in Russian): All the ballot
papers have been collected. I should like to remind the
Council that, as we agreed during our consultations,
the ballots will not be counted until it has been verified
that the ballot papers in the General Assembly have
been collected. However, I have now been informed
that the ballot papers have been collected in the
General Assembly.

The counting of the ballots in the Security
Council will now begin. The tellers will now count the
ballots. As agreed in our consultations, there will be
two independent countings of the ballots, one by each
teller.

We shall wait for the General Assembly to
complete its work. The Council will remain in session.

>l<>l<>l<


The President (spoke in Russian): The result of
the voting is as follows:

Number of ballot papers: 15
Number ofinvalid ballots: 0
Number of valid ballots: 15
Required majority: 8

Number of votes obtained:
Mr. Abdelfattah Amor 2
Mr. Mohamed Bennouna 13

Mr. Thomas Buergenthal 14
Mr. Julio D. Gonzalez Campos 9
Mr. Kenneth Keith 9
Mr. Bernardo Sepulveda Amor 14
Mr. Leonid Skotnikov 14

As more than five candidates - six candidates -
received the required majority, the Council will now
hold another vote on all the candidates, as described in
paragraph 13 of the Secretary-General's memorandum
contained in document S/2005/446.

Accordingly, we shall now hold a vote. I should
like to remind Council members that each elector can
vote for no more than five candidates, and only for the
candidates listed on the ballot. Any ballot paper with
more than five names will be considered invalid.

I request the Conference Officer to distribute the
ballot papers.

Members of the Council should place an "X" in
the boxes next to the names of the candidates for whom
they wish to vote.

The President (spoke in Russian): The result of
the second ballot is as follows:

Number of ballot papers: 15
Number of invalid ballots: 0
Number of valid ballots: 15
Required majority: 8
Number of votes obtained:
Mr. Abdelfattah Amor 2
Mr. Mohamed Bennouna 12
Mr. Thomas Buergenthal 14
Mr. Julio D. Gonzalez Campos 9
Mr. Kenneth Keith 8
Mr. Bernardo Sepulveda Amor 13
Mr. Leonid Skotnikov 13

The outcome is similar to that of the first ballot:
six of the seven candidates have received the required
majority. Accordingly, we shall have to hold a third
ballot.

I propose that we wait a few minutes while the
outcome of the second ballot in the General Assembly
is announced. After we learn the result, we shall take a
decision on how to proceed.

***


The President (spoke in Russian): I wish to
inform members that, as in the Council, more than five
candidates - specifically, six of the seven
candidates - received the required majority in the
second ballot in the General Assembly. Accordingly,
there will be a third ballot in both the Security Council
and the General Assembly.

I understand that the President of the General
Assembly has proposed that the Assembly suspend its
meeting until 3 p.m., when it will reconvene to hold the
third ballot.

I propose that, with the consent of the Council,
we proceed in the same manner and reconvene at
3 p.m. sharp to hold a third ballot. Unless I hear any
objection, I shall take it that the Council agrees with
that proposal.

It is so decided.
I therefore suspend the meeting until 3 p.m.

The meeting was suspended at 1.10 p.m. and
resumed at 3.15 p.m.


The President (spoke in Russian): I have
received a report from the Legal Counsel that, in
separate letters dated 7 November 2005, the
representatives of Tunisia and Sweden informed the
Legal Counsel that their respective national groups had
separately decided to withdraw the candidacy of
Mr. Abdelfattah Amor for election to the International
Court of Justice. Since Mr. Amor's candidacy was
nominated only by the national groups of Tunisia and
Sweden, his name is not included on the third ballot.

The Council will now proceed with a third ballot
for the election of five members of the International
Court of Justice.

I request the Conference Officer to distribute the
ballot papers.

Members of the Council should place an "X" in
the boxes next to the names of the five candidates for
whom they wish to vote.

The President (spoke in Russian): I take it that
all the members of the Council have now marked their
ballots. I ask the Conference Officer to collect the

The President (spoke in Russian): All the ballot
papers have been collected. It is my understanding that
the collection of ballot papers in the General Assembly
is also being completed.

The tellers will now count the ballots. There will
be two independent countings of the ballots, one by
each teller.

We will now await the results of the voting in the
General Assembly.

The President (spoke in Russian): The result of
the voting is as follows:

Mr. Mohamed Bennouna 12
Mr. Thomas Buergenthal 14
Mr. Julio D. Gonzalez Campos 9
Mr. Kenneth Keith 10
Mr. Bernardo Sepulveda Amor 13
Mr. Leonid Skotnikov 13

Since more than five candidates have once again
obtained the required majority of votes, the Council
will now proceed to a new vote on all the candidates,
in accordance with the procedure set forth in paragraph
13 of the Secretary-General's memorandum. It is my
understanding that the General Assembly will also
conduct a fourth round of voting.

I would like to remind members of the Council
that each member may vote for no more than five
candidates and that only those candidates whose names
appear on the ballot papers are eligible. Any ballot
paper containing votes for more than five candidates
will be considered invalid.

The Council will now proceed with a fourth
ballot for the election of five members of the
International Court of Justice.

I request the Conference Officer to distribute the
ballot papers.
Members of the Council should place an "X" in
the boxes next to the names of the five candidates for
whom they wish to vote.

The President (spoke in Russian): Before I
announce the result of the fourth ballot in the Security
Council, I would like to inform members that I have
received a letter from the President of the General
Assembly, Mr. Eliasson, stating that five candidates
have received an absolute majority of the votes in the
General Assembly.

As for the Security Council's fourth ballot, the
result of the voting is as follows:

Number of ballot papers: 15
Number ofinvalid ballots: 0
Number of valid ballots: 15
Required majority: 8
Number of votes obtained:
Mr. Mohamed Bennouna 11
Mr. Thomas Buergenthal 14
Mr. Julio D. Gonzalez Campos 10
Mr. Kenneth Keith 10
Mr. Bernardo Sepulveda Amor 12
Mr. Leonid Skotnikov 13

As more than five candidates received the
required majority, the Council will now hold a new
vote on all the candidates, as described in paragraph 13
of the Secretary-General's memorandum contained in
document S/2005/446.

Accordingly, we shall now hold a fifth ballot. As
I have said, the General Assembly has approved five
candidates and will thus not vote again. Only the
Security Council will vote.
I should like to remind Council members that
each elector may vote for no more than five candidates,
and only for the candidates whose names appear on the
ballot papers. Any ballot paper with more than five
names will be considered invalid.

I take it that the Council is ready to proceed with
the election of five members of the International Court
of Justice.

I request the Conference Officer to distribute the
ballot papers.

Members of the Council should place an "X" in
the boxes next to the names of the candidates for whom
they wish to vote.

Since more than five candidates have received an
absolute majority, the Council will now proceed to a
new vote on all the candidates, as described in
paragraph 13 of the memorandum by the Secretary-
General (S/2005/446).

We shall accordingly proceed to a sixth ballot. I
should like again to remind Council members that each
elector may vote for no more than five candidates and
that only the candidates listed on the ballot papers are
eligible. Any ballot paper with more than five names
will be considered invalid.
