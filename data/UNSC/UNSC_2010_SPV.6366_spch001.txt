The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members have before them document
S/2010/402, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document 8/2010/382 containing the report of the
Secretary-General on the African Union-United
Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft resolution to
the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
France, Gabon, Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria,
Russian Federation, Turkey, Uganda, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America.

The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1935 (2010).

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 10.20 am.
