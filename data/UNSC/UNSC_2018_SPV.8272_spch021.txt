Mr. Danon (Israel): I thank Mr. Mladenov for his
briefing, as well as Ambassador Haley and the United
States for calling for this emergency meeting of the
Security Council. It is not often that the Council calls
for an emergency meeting following a provocation by
Hamas; today's meeting marks a concrete step in the
right direction. But today we need action. The Council
must act on the opportunity presented to it.

In response to the most severe attack by Hamas
and Islamic Jihad since the 2014 Operation Protective
Edge, the Security Council must take two decisive
actions: the first is to condemn Hamas for its war
crimes against Israelis and Palestinians, and the second
is to adopt a resolution designating Hamas as a terrorist
organization, exactly as it did with Al-Qaida and with
the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS).

Let us review the facts. Over the past 24 hours,
Hamas and Islamic Jihad fired nearly 200 rockets and
mortar shells from the Gaza Strip into nearby Israeli
towns and villages. The terrorists began their attacks
on Tuesday, just as parents were preparing their young
children for the school day.

I will share with the Council a chilling example.
During the assault, a mortar shell exploded in the yard
of a kindergarten, damaging the structure. By sheer
luck, the kindergarten was empty, and no one was hurt.
But that attack was a war crime. The deliberate goal of
the terrorists was to kill civilians.

We have warned the Council of Hamas's intentions
time and again. We have explained the imminent danger
posed by the coordinated and violent riots that Hamas
has orchestrated along the security fence. The mob,
incited and paid by Hamas, attempted to breach the
fence by force, opened fire at our soldiers and detonated
explosives. Hamas terrorists even set fire to the Kerem
Shalom civilian border crossing, a crossing designated
for food and humanitarian goods to enter Gaza.

The latest attacks of the past 24 hours - the firing
of shells and rockets at our citizens and the destruction
of major electricity infrastructure for Gaza - only
confirm our countless warnings that Hamas not only
seeks to instil fear in the hearts of Israelis, but that
it could not care less about the Palestinians whom it
controls in Gaza.

In response to these terror attacks, the Israel
Defense Forces (IDF) have targeted Hamas and Islamic
Jihad's terror infrastructure. We also destroyed the
tenth Hamas terror attack tunnel uncovered in Gaza
since October. The IDF destroyed that tunnel, which
began in Gaza, wove through Egypt and ended right
in southern Israel, near the Kerem Shalom civilian
crossing. Like all of Hamas's terror tunnels, this one,
too, was intended to infiltrate Israel and harm as many
civilians as possible. But this terror tunnel also had
a second purpose: to smuggle weapons weapons into
Egypt from Gaza.

Iran's role in this latest unrest should not be
ignored. It is Iranian money that is used to pay the
Hamas rioters on the fence, and it is Iranian rockets that
were fired at our towns. Just like in Syria and Lebanon,
wherever there is terror and violence in our region,
there is Iran. Hamas is no different. No matter which
tactic it chooses, whether it is suicide bombers, rioters
at the fence or rockets and missiles, when Hamas has
the opportunity to harm innocent people, it does not
hold back. That is its sickening ideology.

We have here a situation that is black and white.
Israel disengaged from Gaza in 2005, as I keep
reminding the Council. Hamas took over the following
year and since then has done nothing but terrorize
Israel and prolong the suffering of the people of Gaza.
Let us not forget either that Hamas continues to hold
the bodies of two Israeli soldiers, Hadar Goldin and
Oron Shaul, and two Israeli civilians, Avera Mengistu
and Hisham al-Sayed. We will not rest until they have
returned home.

Let me remind the Council that the situation in
Gaza today is the direct result of Hamas's refusal to
renounce violence. Let me also remind it that the
Quartet conditions, put forward by the United States,
the Russian Federation, the European Union and the
United Nations, were very clear about the need to
renounce violence as a means of achieving goals.

We have said it time and again: if there were no
terror, there would be no restrictions, and it is the
people of Gaza who would benefit most. Even today,
when the United Nations Special Coordinator for
the Middle East Peace Process, Nickolay Mladenov,
advocates for civilian projects in Gaza, it is Hamas that
destroys those prospects. It is Israel that attaches great
importance to the international efforts to assist Gaza's
economy and development.

Hamas destroys civilian infrastructure because
it does not want the people of Gaza to live in peace.
Hamas has carried out endless terror attacks against
Israel and the Palestinians in Gaza, and the past 24
hours have been no different.

There is no moral equivalence; there is not even
a question of morality. Some cynical members of the
Council are circulating a shameful draft resolution
that does not even mention Hamas. Look at the draft:
the idea that Hamas's violence could be rewarded by a
resolution condemning Israel is absurd.

Every member of the Council needs to ask itself
how it could possibly support a draft resolution that
condemns Israel but does not even mention Hamas once.
Members should read the draft tonight; they are going
to vote on it. Maybe they can help me find the word
"Hamas" in it. How many times is Israel mentioned?
Hamas, not even once. What hypocrisy.

If this body does not issue a clear condemnation of
Hamas, it will raise the question of whether this body
is capable ofprotecting innocent life against terror. The
key step is to accept reality: that Hamas is a terrorist
organization, nothing less. Terrorist organizations
must be designated as such by the Security Council.
Designating Hamas as a terrorist organization would
enable the Council to sanction its leaders, its members
and every person or entity with which it associates. It is
a designation that would result in countless lives saved.

It is high time that the international community
combat Hamas with the same tools and vigour that it
uses against Al-Qaida and ISIS. Let me be clear: if
Israeli children cannot sleep quietly at night, then the
terrorists of Gaza will feel the might of the IDF. We
will not allow anyone to harm our citizens, and we will
do all that is necessary to defend them.

We ask the Security Council to have the courage
and the moral clarity to take the following actions:
condemn Hamas and designate it as a terrorist
organization recognized by the United Nations.

The meeting rose at 5pm.
