Ms. Ivanovic (Serbia): I thank the Permanent
Representative of Germany, Mr. Heusgen, for his
question. Related to the statement we heard today
by Ms. Korjenie, one of our briefers, I would like to
express my support of what was said by the Permanent
Representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The
message was that all the war crimes committed in
Bosnia and Herzegovina should be prosecuted and all
victims and survivors respected, regardless of their
ethnicity or religious affiliation. We believe that that
is the right path, that of approaching perpetrators and
victims in an impartial and unbiased way. That is the
right path to reconciliation.

The meeting rose at 12.15 pm.
