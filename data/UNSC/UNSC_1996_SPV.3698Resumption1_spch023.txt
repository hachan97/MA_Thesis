Mr. Downer (Australia): The violent events which
have taken place in Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza
during the last three days have deeply shocked the
Australian Government and people. I want immediately to
take the opportunity offered by this open meeting of the

 

Council to express Australia's sympathy to the families of
all those injured and killed. Clearly, there is great
frustration in the areas where this violence has occurred.
The only enduring answer that can be given to that
frustration is peace. Peace must be pursued with vigour and
must be accompanied by serious attempts to eliminate
fundamental sources of injustice and to spread the message
of tolerance.
Australia calls upon the Government of Israel and the
Palestinian Authority to do everything in their power to
stop the violence. They should ensure that no steps are
taken which further provoke violence.

Australia strongly supports the Madrid process because
it offers the best prospects for the achievement of a just and
secure peace in the Middle East. In this context, we also
call on all parties to honour the obligations and
commitments they have made, including by commencing
substantive talks on final status issues and the redeployment
of forces. All parties should recommit themselves to the
search for a peaceful resolution of their differences. They
must resume direct dialogue. The promise to negotiate
solutions was given. Those negotiations must not be stalled
or avoided. It is only through such steps that progress
towards forging a durable peace and securing the future
welfare of both the Israeli and Palestinian people can be
restored.
