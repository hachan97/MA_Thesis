Mr. Adi (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic):
In accordance with our statements on the subject matter
before us today and with regard to putting an end to
the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, I
will respond to some comments made by the Israeli
representative.

The funding of and support for armed groups in
Syria by certain States are clear. As is well kown, the
conflict and wars in the Middle East are caused by the
Israeli occupation. That is well documented by many
international organizations. Israel's history is bleak and
full of slaughter. Israel has occupied the Arab territories
for more than 60 years. Israeli State terrorism has
perpetrated the worst crimes against civilians in the
Syrian Golan, Lebanon and Palestine.

For Israel to claim to regret the situation in Syria is
an attempt to divert attention from the Israeli occupation
of the Golan since 1967, wreaking humiliation and
slaughter, expelling our citizens and flouting all
international resolutions that have urged Israel to put
an end to the occupation of the Arab territories. The
assistance referred to by the representative of Israel,
which he placed in a humanitarian context, must not
mislead the Council. Israel persists in allowing terrorists
to work in the area of separation and to perpetrate their
terrorist acts.

We could speak at length of Israel's actions. What
we have heard today bears witness to its practices. In
the interest of brevity, that is all I will say.
