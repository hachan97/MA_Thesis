The President: The Security Council will
continue its consideration of the item on its agenda.
The Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General pursuant to Security
Council resolution 1559 (2004) contained in document
S/2004/777. I wish to draw the attention of the
members of the Council to document S/2004/794,
which contains the text of a letter dated 5 October 2004
from the representative of Lebanon, addressed to the
Secretary-General. I also wish to draw attention to
document S/2004/796, which contains the text of a
note verbale dated 6 October 2004 from the Permanent
Mission of the Syrian Arab Republic addressed to the
President of the Council.

After consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council welcomes the report
of the Secretary-General of 3 October 2004
(S/2004/777) on the implementation of resolution
1559 (2004) of 2 September 2004.

"The Security Council takes note of the
letter from the Permanent Representative of
Lebanon dated 5 October (S/2004/794) and of the
note verbale from the Permanent Mission of the
Syrian Arab Republic dated 6 October 2004
(S/2004/796).

"The Security Council reaffirms its strong
support for the territorial integrity, sovereignty
and political independence of Lebanon within its
internationally recognized borders.

"The Council notes with concern that the
requirements set out in resolution 1559 (2004)
have not been met, as reported by the Secretary-
General. The Council urges relevant parties to
implement fully all provisions of this resolution,
and welcomes the Secretary-General's readiness
to assist the parties in this regard.

"The Security Council appreciates the
Secretary-General's intention to keep the Council
updated. It requests that he continue to report on
the implementation of the resolution to the
Council every six months."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2004/ 36.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 10.25 am.
