The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2005/127, which contains the text of a
letter dated 24 February 2005 from the Secretary-
General addressed to the President of the Security
Council concerning the list of candidates to the
International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and,
in particular, the suggestion contained therein to extend
the deadline for nominations to the Tribunal until
31 March 2005.

Members of the Council also have before them
the draft of a letter which I, as President of the Security
Council, would propose to send to the Secretary-
General in reply to the aforementioned letter.

In the absence of objection, I shall assume that
the Security Council endorses the proposal of the
Secretary-General and agrees that I should send the
letter as drafted to the Secretary-General.

It is so decided.

The reply will be issued as a document of the
Council under the symbol S/2005/ 159.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.
