Mr. Mansour (Palestine): The delegation of
Palestine expresses its appreciation for the convening
of this important open debate on a topic that is very
timely and relevant for the Security Council:
"Strengthening international law: rule of law and the
maintenance of international peace and security". We
express our appreciation to Denmark for the discussion
paper it has prepared to help guide this debate
(S/2006/367, annex), which raises many relevant issues
and questions of concern to which the Security Council
should give serious consideration in the conduct of its
work, as it strives to carry out its responsibilities under
the Charter of the United Nations. We would also like
to welcome the President of the International Court of
Justice (ICJ) and the United Nations Legal Counsel and
to thank them for their valuable interventions.

The issue of strengthening international law and
the maintenance of international peace and security is
clearly of importance to the entire international
community. It is an issue of particular concern to us, as
the question of Palestine has consistently been on the
Security Council's agenda since the inception of the
United Nations and remains a question of which the
Council is seized, for it tragically remains unresolved
after the passage of several decades.

As appropriately noted in the discussion paper,
the Security Council has the authority to promote the
peaceful settlement of disputes and to take steps to
ensure compliance with international law. In terms of
the question of Palestine specifically, the Council has
exerted repeated efforts, through its debates and, more
important, through the adoption of dozens of
resolutions, to bring about respect for the relevant rules
and principles of international law aimed at ultimately
securing a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict. Yet, for various reasons, including lack of
follow-up and of implementation of its resolutions, and
excessive use of the veto at critical junctures, the

06-4010]
Council has regrettably been unable to effectively exert
its authority with regard to this conflict.

While, since 1967, the Security Council has
adopted more than 40 resolutions specifically on the
situation in the occupied Palestinian territory, including
East Jerusalem - 27 of which, for example, reaffirm
or recall the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of
12 August 1949 - the Council has been unable to take
the action necessary for implementation of those
resolutions and thus for bringing about compliance by
Israel, the occupying Power, with its obligations under
international law, including humanitarian law and
human rights law.

In that regard, Israel's policies and practices
against the Palestinian people under its occupation
since 1967 and until the present have included not only
systematic human rights violations, but acts
constituting grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva
Convention under its article 147 - that is, war crimes.
These have included, but not been limited to: military
raids and attacks; excessive and indiscriminate use of
force against civilians, including children and women;
extrajudicial executions; wanton and deliberate
destruction of property, including homes; confiscation
of land; construction of colonial settlements and
transfer of the occupying Power's civilians to the
occupied territory; construction of a wall besieging and
isolating civilians in walled enclaves; arrest, detention
and imprisonment of thousands of civilians, including
minors; and collective punishment of the entire civilian
population, including by means of severe restrictions
on freedom of movement.

In a situation such as this - one in which
violations and grave breaches of international law are
being relentlessly committed and the perpetrators are
not being held accountable and continue to defy the
law with impunity - the unfortunate result is the
weakening of international law, giving rise to
accusations of double standards in the implementation
of the law, and the undermining of the credibility of
those institutions entrusted with implementing the law.
The perpetuation of such situations is clearly harmful
not only to those civilian populations subjected to such
violations, but also to the international system itself. In
the case of Palestine, the fostering of this culture of
impunity by appeasement of the occupying Power or
by ignoring its incessant violations against the civilian
population under its occupation has not only
aggravated the situation by failing to bring about an
end to the violations, including an end to Israel's
belligerent military occupation itself, but has also
prolonged a conflict that has caused so much suffering,
loss and hardship for the Palestinian people, as well as
for the entire region, whose stability and security is
under constant threat as a result of the ongoing
occupation.

Appropriate measures in accordance with the
purposes and principles of the Charter should be taken
to remedy the situation in the interest of upholding and
strengthening the rule of international law and
promoting peace and security in the world. In that
regard, it is clearly in the interest of the international
community to exert all efforts necessary for securing a
peaceful settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as
well as of the Arab-Israeli conflict as a whole, on the
basis of international law and the resolutions of the
United Nations.

The Security Council, in accordance with its
authority and responsibilities under the Charter, should
play a leading role in that effort. We firmly believe in
the authority and the ability of the Security Council to
do so and in the legitimacy and rule of international
law. It is our strongest hope that one day soon these
efforts will become a reality and will ultimately allow
for peace, justice and security to become a reality in
our part of the world.

At the same time, we stress the importance of the
role of the General Assembly, in accordance with the
Charter, in the progressive development of
international law, in conjunction with the role ascribed
to the Security Council for that purpose. With regard to
the question of Palestine, we believe that the
Assembly's efforts have definitely contributed to the
promotion and strengthening of international law,
including, for example, by its use of the International
Court of Justice. In December 2003, the Assembly
requested the ICJ to urgently render an advisory
opinion on the legal consequences arising from the
construction by Israel, the occupying Power, of a wall
in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East
Jerusalem, "considering the rules and principles of
international law, including the Fourth Geneva
Convention of 1949, and relevant Security Council and
General Assembly resolutions" (General Assembly resolution ES-lO/Z4, the operative para.) It was on
that clear basis of international law that the Court
examined the situation and presented its findings in its
advisory opinion of 9 July 2004.

In its entirety, the advisory opinion constitutes a
comprehensive and authoritative determination by the
ICJ of the applicable rules and principles of
international law, including humanitarian and human
rights law, and the specific legal obligations by which
Israel, the occupying Power, is bound under
international law. The Assembly appropriately
followed up the Court's advisory opinion by
acknowledging it, demanding that Israel comply with
its legal obligations as mentioned in the opinion, and
also calling upon all United Nations Member States to
comply with their legal obligations.

In this regard, it is imperative to recall that the
Court, in paragraph E of the dispositif, also determined
that

"The United Nations, and especially the
General Assembly and the Security Council,
should consider what further action is required to
bring to an end the illegal situation resulting from
the construction of the wall and the associated
regime, taking due account of the present
Advisory Opinion". (A/59/4, para. 246)

Unfortunately, the Security Council has to date
remained silent on the issue of the unlawful
construction of the wall in the occupied Palestinian
territory, including East Jerusalem, has not
acknowledged or utilized the ICJ's advisory opinion in
that regard, and has not taken any action to bring an
end to this illegal situation, which is destroying the
territorial integrity and contiguity of the Palestinian
territory, exacerbating the dire economic, social and
humanitarian conditions of the Palestinian civilian
population and seriously jeopardizing the prospects for
the achievement of a peaceful settlement of the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict based on a two-State solution,
international law, United Nations resolutions and the
Arab peace initiative.

It is not too late, however, for the Security
Council to use its authority to address this issue and to
undertake the appropriate measures for bringing an end
to Israel's violations and grave breaches and for
salvaging the prospects of reaching a peaceful
settlement.
In conclusion, by undertaking such an effort, the
Council would be actively fulfilling its Charter

06-4010]
responsibilities on the basis of legal mechanisms in
unison with the other organs of the United Nations, and
would also be making a major contribution to
strengthening an international order based on legal
principles. Moreover, that would reaffirm and reassert
the important role that the Security Council should
rightfully play in the search for a just, lasting,
comprehensive and peaceful settlement of the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict and in the maintenance of peace
and security in the Middle East.

Our deepest hope is that the Council, in the light
of this important debate and of the many significant
issues it has brought to the forefront, will soon set an
appropriate course of action to undertake its
responsibilities vis-a-vis the question of Palestine, thus
upholding and strengthening the rule of law and
promoting peace and security for both the Palestinian
and Israeli peoples as well as for the Middle East
region as a whole, and beyond.
