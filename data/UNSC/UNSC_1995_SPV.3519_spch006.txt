Mr. Ubalijoro (Rwanda): My delegation decided to
co-sponsor this draft resolution for one specific reason: to
alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people.

Indeed, the machinery provided for in this document
is in full accordance with that principle. It is painful for
my delegation to sit down and cross its arms while great
numbers of Iraqis seem to be condemned to eternal

 

suffering because of the lack of sensitivity and cooperation
of a few.

Moreover, I would like to reiterate that this is a
temporary measure to provide for the needs of the Iraqi
people until Iraq's fulfilment of all its obligations contained
in all the relevant Security Council documents. It is of
paramount importance that Iraq comply fully with its
remaining obligations in order for the Council to take
further positive steps that are in the best interest of the
Government of Iraq, and especially its people.

It is in this context that we would like to send an
important message to the Government of Iraq.

Needless to say, the international community is not
against the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Iraq.
Inspired by the great principles contained in the United
Nations Charter, we call upon Iraq to adhere to all the
moral obligations that all sovereign and peace-loving
countries undertake in order to live in a climate of mutual
respect, harmony and peace. That is also why my
delegation will vote for the present draft resolution.
