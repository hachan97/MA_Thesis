President Santos Calderon (spoke in Spanish):
I have come before the Security Council first and
foremost to thank all of its members for the support
extended to my country and Government in establishing
peace. I am also here to report the outcome of almost
six years of negotiations - two years in secret and four
in open talks - that is the result of a great effort to
end the last armed conflict in the western hemisphere,
which lasted 52 years and inflicted all sorts of suffering
and pain on my country.

The Final Peace Agreement is sui generis, because
this may be the first time ever that two parties have
reached an accord to establish a special peace
jurisdiction and court and submit themselves to its
authority. This is the first time that the victims have
been placed at the centre of the solution to a conflict,
along with their rights to truth, justice, reparations and
non-recurrence. This is also the first peace agreement
that has a special chapter on gender, ensuring that
women enjoy the same rights as men. We stress that
particular aspect.

I bring the thanks of 50 million Colombians, and
above all the 8 million victims among them, for the
support offered by all members of the Security Council
to our work, which represents a contribution to world
peace.
