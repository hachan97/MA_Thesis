The President (spoke in French): I thank
President Meron for his briefing and for the kind words
he addressed to my country. As this is his last
presentation before the Council, I believe that I reflect
the feelings of all those present in paying tribute to his
work.

I now give the floor to Judge Erik Mose,
President of the International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda.
