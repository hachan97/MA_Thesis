Mr. Dahlgren (Sweden): The International
Monitoring Committee and the Inter-African Mission to
Monitor the Implementation of the Bangui Agreements
(MISAB) are playing an important role in facilitating a
return to peace and security in the Central African
Republic. Today, we wish to express our particular
appreciation to all those involved in these efforts - to
the Chairman of the International Mediation Committee,
President Bongo, to its members, to the troop contributors
and other contributors to MISAB, and to the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

Progress has been achieved over the past year in
implementing the Bangui Agreements. We hope that
concerted efforts will now be made to implement the
outstanding provisions, as set out in the letter dated 8
January 1998 from the President of the Central African
Republic to the Secretary-General. Sweden supports the
extension of the Security Council's authorization to
MISAB until mid-March.

We also see the need for a continued international
presence in the Central African Republic after the end of
MISAB's mandate. The United Nations is responsible for
international peace and security. We therefore support the
proposal that the follow-up to MISAB take the form of a

 

United Nations operation. We look forward to the detailed
concept of operations which the Secretary-General intends
to submit to the Security Council.

We attach particular importance to the preventive and
multifunctional aspect of the envisaged United Nations
operation. The military and civilian components of that
mission will need to pull together in close cooperation with
United Nations agencies and the Bretton Woods institutions.

Sweden will vote in favour of the draft resolution
before the Council today.
