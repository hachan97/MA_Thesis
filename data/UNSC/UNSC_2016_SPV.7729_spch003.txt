The President (spoke in French): I thank
Mr. Mladenov for his briefing.

Before inviting Council members to informal
consultations to continue our discussion on the subject,
as this is the last scheduled meeting of the Council for
the month of June, I would like to express the sincere
appreciation of the delegation of France to the members
of the Council, especially my colleagues the Permanent
Representatives, their respective staffs and the
secretariat of the Council for the very valuable support
they have given to us.

It has been a very busy month, and one in which
we rallied to consensus on several important issues
within our purview. We could not have done it alone, of
course, or without the hard work, support and positive
contribution of every delegation and the representatives
of the Secretariat, as well as the relevant conference
service officers. As we end our presidency, I know I
speak on behalfofthe Council in wishing the delegation
of Japan good luck in the month of July.

The meeting rose at 10.20 a.m.
