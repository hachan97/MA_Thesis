The President (interpretation from Chinese): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Argentina, Canada, Haiti and
Venezuela, in which they request to be invited to participate
in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives to
participate in the discussion without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Lelong (Haiti)
took a seat at the Council table; Mr. Petrella
(Argentina), Mr. Fowler (Canada) and Mr. Escovar-
Salom (Venezuela) took the seats reserved for them at
the side of the Council Chamber.

The President (interpretation from Chinese): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on the agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Transition
Mission in Haiti, documents S/ 1997/832 and
S/l997/832/Add.1.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/ 1997/931, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by Argentina, Canada, Chile, Costa
Rica, France, Portugal, the United States of America and
Venezuela.

The first speaker is the representative of Haiti, to
whom I give the floor.
