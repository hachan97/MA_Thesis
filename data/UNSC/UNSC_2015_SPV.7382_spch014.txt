Ms. Murmokaite (Lithuania): Lithuania welcomes
the adoption by consensus of resolution 2201 (2015), on
Yemen, which we were happy to sponsor. In the past
months, the Security Council has not always been at
its best, and we have been too slow to act on several
occasions. This particular signal that the Council is ready
to rise to the challenge and do its part in supporting the
transition in Yemen is therefore essential. Through this
resolution, the Council is sending a powerful message
that all parties, in particular the Houthis, must engage
in a constructive and inclusive dialogue that leads to
agreement on a draft constitution and on the holding of
a constitutional referendum and elections within a clear
time frame.

The core idea behind the involvement of the United
Nations and the Council is Yemen was to present
its people with a clear break from the past based on
democracy, human rights, the rule of law and national
reconciliation. That idea, enshrined in the Initiative of
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the outcomes of
the National Dialogue Conference and the Peace and
National Partnership Agreement, should remain the key
reference point for any future path. We thank the main
sponsors and authors of the resolution - Jordan and the
United Kingdom. As our United Kingdom colleague
did, I would also like to stress the role of the GCC,
which remains essential in Yemen moving forward.
