Mr. Dejammet (France) (interpretation from French): It is important that Security Council resolutions
986 (1995) and 1.1.11 (1997) be implemented as
effectively and continuously as possible. Their
humanitarian purpose makes this even more urgent. The
plan proposed in the draft resolution before us goes in
this direction, and this is why, from the outset, we have
supported efforts for the adoption of a technical,
humanitarian text. In matters of this type, we would like
the Security Council to show its solidarity and
cohesiveness. We realize that the obligations of all should
be recalled, and it is in this context that we understand
the very justified appeal in the text to improve the
situation. We understand this as an expression of
encouragement to all concerned, and in particular to the
Security Council Committee established by resolution 661
(1990).
