Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We are grateful to the Permanent
Representative of Japan, Ambassador Takasu, for
having briefed the Council on the work of the Security
Council Committee established pursuant to resolution
1737 (2006) over the past 90 days and for the work
undertaken in that period. The Committee will need to
continue to study the specific situation, which was the
main focus of his briefing.

Over the period in question, the Committee
continued to act in strict compliance with the
provisions of the Security Council resolutions 1737
(2006), 1747 (2007) and 1803 (2008). In our view, the
Committee should, in its future work, continue to work
in the spirit and letter of those resolutions, with a view
to effectively resolving the Iranian nuclear problem
exclusively through political and diplomatic means.

At present, the situation relating to the Iranian
nuclear programme is not simple. Unfortunately, it is
still not possible to have substantive negotiations with
the Iranian side. Nevertheless, the six States, including
Russia, have not discarded the possibility of renewed
dialogue with a view to reaching a comprehensive
resolution of all issues relating to the nuclear
programme of Iran. In our work in this area we need to
be patient and calm, and must not let ourselves be
overcome by emotion. Emotion will only hinder us in
achieving our objective.

We hope that the resolution adopted on
27 November (GOV/2009/82) by the Board of
Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) will have a positive impact. We expect that
Iran will take the signals contained in the IAEA
resolution very seriously and that it will cooperate
fully with the IAEA for a swift return to negotiations
on the situation relating to the Iranian nuclear problem.
