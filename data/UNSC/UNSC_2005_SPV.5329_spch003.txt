Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
We have taken note of the report submitted to the
Security Council by Mr. Mehlis, head of the
International Independent Investigation Commission.
The Commission is making fresh headway in its
investigation, but it has not yet finished its work. Much
remains to be done. We have also taken note of the
recent request by Lebanon, and we express our full
understanding in that respect.

The main purpose of resolution 1644 (2005),
which the Council has just adopted, is to extend the
mandate of the International Independent Investigation
Commission so that it can continue to assist the
Lebanese Government in establishing the facts
regarding the assassination of Mr. Hariri. For those
reasons, China voted in favour of resolution 1644
(2005). We hope that, given the efforts and cooperation
of all the parties concerned, the Commission will soon
uncover the truth of the matter.
