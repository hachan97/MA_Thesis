The President: With the Members' permission, I
would like to - I have to - draw your attention to the
need to respect this Council. I understand that we are
not in a Broadway theatre, and what is going on is not
exactly a musical, but I would still request all present
kindly to switch off their mobile phones and put them
on silent mode. Since the last time I checked - in fact,
double-checked - it was confirmed to me that all
modern mobile phones are equipped with this feature.
They vibrate or they do something else, but they do not
produce sound which distracts speakers.
