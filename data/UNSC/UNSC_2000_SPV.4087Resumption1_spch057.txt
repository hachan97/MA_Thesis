The President: We have only a few speakers left. I
am optimistic that if we move rapidly we will finish
shortly. If any representatives wish to make any concluding
observations, they will, of course, be welcome to do so.

The next speaker on my list is the representative of
Cyprus. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and
to make his statement.
