Mr. Diarra (spoke in French): Among the
comments that have been made in the course of this
meeting, it was said that the various strategies that
have been developed to deal with Sierra Leone were
aimed at Sierra Leone. For instance, even the sanctions
established in resolution 1343 (2001) were themselves
aimed at strengthening the peace process in Sierra
Leone. I believe that the Council must now try to
develop a strategy specifically on Liberia, and I would
like to draw the Council's attention to that matter.

Secondly, I would ask how we can coordinate the
strategy to be developed by the Council with the
strategy of the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), with which the Council is familiar
and which has been the subject of occasional reports to
the Security Council.

Lastly, I wonder how we can support the strategy
on the ground so as not to give the impression that we
are speaking about two different things, that is to say,
that there is a difference between the position of the
Security Council and that of ECOWAS. It should be
understood that we are acting on behalf and under the
mandate of the Council, and in accordance with the
Charter.
