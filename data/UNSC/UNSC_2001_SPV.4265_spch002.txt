Mr. Rosenstock (United States of America):
Thank you very much for that very touching comment.
I see there are more speakers than even I have years, so
I will be very brief and merely again express my very
profound thanks for the extraordinary gesture on the
part of Security Council members, who - all of them
out of order - applauded, which was even more
enjoyable, and I certainly do not raise a point of order
to it. Thank you again.
