Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I will be brief. I actually forgot to mention
three issues that I think it is important to mention
today. I would first like to sincerely thank you,
Mr. President, for your stewardship of today's meeting.
It has been difficult, but you managed to conduct it in
truly presidential fashion. Secondly, I should recall
something that I forgot to mention, which is that
our alternative draft resolution (S/2017/933) was not
submitted yesterday but has been before the Council
since 7 November.

Lastly, I would like to note, which I omitted
to earlier, that while Bolivia clearly does not need
Russia's protection, it does need support. In my view,
the United States representative's accusations of a lack
of transparency with regard to today's process on the
part of the representative of Bolivia were completely
unjustified. Regrettably, we saw far less transparency
in today's voting process displayed by our counterparts
in the negotiations.

The meeting rose at 5.45 pm.
