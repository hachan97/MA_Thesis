The President: I shall now give the floor to
members ofthe Council. But before I do so, let me note
that we have had an exceptionally rich exchange of
views. Many key points have emerged. It is clear from
the briefings that have been given that, despite wide
recognition as one ofthe more successful peacekeeping
operations, huge challenges remain. I think Mr. Vieira
de Mello was being modest-or perhaps even more
important, realistic - when he acknowledged that
much still remains to be done. The East Timorese will
need ongoing commitment of the international
community for many years in support of the embryonic
Government of East Timor.

Mr. Mark Malloch Brown of UNDP said that East
Timor needs our support for tomorrow even more than
for today. The World Bank noted that we need to
develop a clear and structured plan for the transition
and post-independence mandate. The IMF explained in
detail how a patient consultative process to develop
long-term and sustainable financial institutions and
processes is necessary. The President of the General
Assembly, Mr. Holkeri, noted that we cannot afford to
exit East Timor prematurely or without a well-prepared
strategy. And finally, Mr. Ramos-Horta also told us
that, while he would not want the United Nations
forces to remain forever, a premature withdrawal
would be difficult for East Timor.

In brief, many major points have emerged, and
we hope that Council members will address them.
