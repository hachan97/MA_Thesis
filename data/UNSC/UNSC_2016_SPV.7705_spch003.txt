The President (spoke in French): I wish to extend
my heartfelt thanks to Ms. Mogherini for her presence
here today, for her commitment and for her briefing.
As she has most kindly underscored, this is the second
time she has met with the Security Council under the
presidency of France (see S/PV.7402). We are most
pleased with that and hope to continue this tradition.

I shall now give the floor to the members of the
Security Council.
