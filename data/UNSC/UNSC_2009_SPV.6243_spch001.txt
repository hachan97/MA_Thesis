The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2009/645, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Austria.
I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to documents S/2009/571 and S/2009/601 containing
the texts of two letters from the Secretary-General
addressed to the President of the Security Council,
dated 2 and 23 November 2009, respectively.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Austria, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, Japan, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,
Mexico, Russian Federation, Turkey, Uganda,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, United States of America, Viet Nam

The President (spoke in French): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1901 (2009).

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Council will remain seized of the matter.
