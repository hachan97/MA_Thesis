Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I should like to express our gratitude to the
members of the Council for their support of resolution
1918 (2010), which was submitted by the Russian
Federation. We are grateful to our colleagues for the
constructive approach and valuable ideas that made it
possible to give momentum to this important anti-
piracy initiative.

In our view, the resolution adopted today is of
particular importance amid the growing threat posed by
piracy off the coast of Somalia and in more distant
regions of the Indian Ocean. Today, the Security
Council has sent an important political message: that
the international community is determined to combat
impunity and intends to continue seeking additional
mechanisms to enhance the effectiveness of the
prosecution of those who carry out, plan and conduct
acts of piracy.
