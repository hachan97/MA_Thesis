The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now proceed to the consideration of its
annual report to the General Assembly, the draft of
which has been prepared by the Secretariat.

Members of the Council have before them the
draft report of the Security Council to the General
Assembly for the period from 16 June 2000 to 15 June
2001, as circulated by the Officer-in-Charge of the
Department of Political Affairs on 27 August 2001, and
a corrigendum thereto.

I should like to express my great appreciation and
that of the Security Council to the Secretariat for the
work it has undertaken in preparing this report.

I shall now call on the Assistant Secretary-
General for Political Affairs to make an explanatory
statement.
