The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Ms. Bensouda for her briefing.

I shall now give the floor to the members of the
Security Council who wish to make statements. I would
like to remind speakers that, if possible, they should
limit their statements to no more than five minutes.
After five minutes the speaker's microphone will start
blinking. The Council's agenda today is very full and
intense, so I would request that speakers with long
statements give a condensed version in the Chamber and
circulate the full text to the other members separately.
