Mr. Kawamura (Japan): I would like to express my
sincere appreciation to the United States delegation for
its effective guidance of the consultations on today's
important adoption ofresolution 2351 (2017). Japan also
appreciates the Secretary-General's efforts to solve the
Guergerat crisis and create an environment conducive
to a resumption of the political process.

Japan voted in favor of the resolution extending
the mandate of the United Nations Mission for the
Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) for another
year in recognition of its important role in monitoring
the ceasefire that contributes to the region's peace and
stability. As we mentioned during the Council's 6 April
debate on peacekeeping (see S/PV.7918), we are eager
to improve the effectiveness of peacekeeping. We need
to assess whether the continued deployment of a given
peacekeeping operation fits the reality on the ground
and also hold deeper discussions in the Council in order
to link political processes to mandates. MINURSO is an
illustration of both of those points. We must pay more
serious attention to the Mission's effectiveness and
to reinvigorating the political process. We very much
hope that today's resolution will play an important role
in relaunching the political process.
