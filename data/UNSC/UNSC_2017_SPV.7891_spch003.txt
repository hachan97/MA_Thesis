The President: I thank Mr. Tanin for his briefing.

I wish to remind invited participants to limit their
statements to no more than 10 minutes, in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
A red light will flash on the microphones when the
lO-minute mark is reached.

I now give the floor to President Nikolie.
