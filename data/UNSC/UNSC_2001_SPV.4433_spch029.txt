The President (spoke in French): I thank the
representative of Norway for his kind words addressed
to me.

I shall now make a statement in my capacity as
the representative of Mali.

My delegation broadly shares the views expressed
in the Council today. However, after expressing my
gratitude to the Secretary-General for his report to and
Mr. Annabi for his briefing, I would like to make a few
brief comments.

First of all, we welcome the encouraging results
that have been obtained in the implementation of the
Dayton Accords, and we urge all the communities of
Bosnia and Herzegovina to participate actively in the
building of a multi-ethnic and democratic society and
in promoting the peaceful return of refugees.

Secondly, we invite the authorities of Bosnia and
Herzegovina to continue the macroeconomic reform
that is being undertaken, and we encourage the regional
players to provide support for the economic
development of Bosnia and Herzegovina with a view to
consolidating peace in that country.

Thirdly, we welcome and encourage the efforts
being made to restructure the police and reform the
judiciary, as well as the human rights institutions. It is
certainly true that all of these efforts will help to
establish an effective judicial system that can dispense
true justice to the citizens - a prerequisite for peace.

In conclusion, I would like to reaffirm the strong
support of my delegation for the invaluable efforts of
the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, and we associate ourselves with the
appeal to the international community for full support
for the efforts to reconstruct Bosnia and Herzegovina.

I now resume my functions as President.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to whom I
give the floor.
