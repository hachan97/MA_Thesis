Mr. Kooijmans (Netherlands): The Netherlands will
vote in favour of the draft resolution on the extension of
the mandate of the United Nations Mission in the Central
African Republic (MINURCA), first of all to express its
firm support for the positive contribution of MINURCA to
the political process in the Central African Republic.

Secondly, the Netherlands welcomes the fact that the
draft resolution integrates in a comprehensive way essential
aspects of peace-building and reconstruction, such as a
transparent electoral process, the restructuring of the armed
forces and economic reform.

In this approach, it is indeed essential that the
Government of the Central African Republic continue to
work closely with the Economic and Social Council, the
United Nations Development Programme and the Bretton
Woods institutions. The Netherlands expects that important
lessons can be learned - and applied elsewhere - from
the implementation of this comprehensive approach in the
Central African Republic, and in this regard we are looking
forward to the progress reports of the Secretary-General of
the United Nations.
