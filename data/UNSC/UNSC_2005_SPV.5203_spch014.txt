Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria) (spoke in French): I
would like, first of all, to welcome the Minister of
Justice of Burundi, Mr. Kiganahe, and to thank him for
his statement and for the clarification he has provided.
I also thank Mr. Zacklin for his excellent presentation
of the report of the assessment mission on the creation
of an international judicial commission for Burundi.

My delegation notes with satisfaction that the
mission to Burundi came back convinced of the need to
set up an international mechanism for seeking the truth
and establishing responsibility for crimes committed in
that country.

The process of adopting the law to create the
national truth and reconciliation commission and the
scepticism with which that law has been greeted testify
to the need for a credible, impartial and independent
mechanism likely to win the support of all Burundians
in their search for truth and justice. The support of the
international community is essential to establish
national reconciliation on a solid foundation. The
formula that is proposed - a two-stage mechanism
consisting of a national truth commission of mixed
composition to look into accountability, and a special
chamber in the court system to pursue those
responsible for crimes, with both having a major
international component - seems to us to be of a
nature to help the Burundians to reach the goal of
promoting the rule of law, protecting human rights and
fighting impunity. This formula also is less
burdensome and easier to implement, and it opens up
the prospect of contributing to the long-term
improvement of the functioning of the judicial system
in Burundi.

We hope that the Security Council will be able to
respond positively to the expectations of the people of
Burundi with regard to the search for truth promoting
justice and fighting impunity, as expressed by the
Minister, Mr. Kiganahe.
