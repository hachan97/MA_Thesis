Mr. Sidorov (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian): The Russian Federation feels deep
satisfaction at the impressive success of the peace process
in El Salvador and at the completion of one of the most
fruitful operations of the United Nations. The experience
of this 45-month-long multifunctional operation shows
that patience and persistence in seeking ways towards a
settlement and in implementing the agreements reached
can resolve even the most complex and protracted
conflicts. Of course, for this to occur there must be a
sincere desire to achieve a stable peace, and this the
Government of El Salvador and the Frente Farabundo
Marti para la Liberacion Nacional (FMLN) are showing.
We congratulate the people of El Salvador, and this is
also a great success for the international community, and
the United Nations especially.

 

Now what must be done is to consolidate the success
that has been achieved by rendering the peace process
irreversible. We rely on the parties in El Salvador to
redouble their efforts with a view to fulfilling, as quickly as
possible, the parts of the peace agreements that still remain
to be fulfilled.

The Russian Federation attaches great importance to
the fact that, within the context of the continuing United
Nations presence in El Salvador after the peace-keeping
operation ends, provision has been made for a combined
approach to the tasks that need doing during the post-
conflict peace-building stage. In this, close cooperation will
be needed between El Salvador and the United Nations
Development Programme, and also with the other
specialized agencies of the United Nations and the
international financial institutions. We hope that this
cooperation will be successfully carried out.
