Mr. Hume (United States of America): The
United States would like to welcome Foreign Minister
Miranda back to the Security Council for this important
meeting.

Today the United States is pleased that
Portuguese Ambassador Monteiro will speak for us in
his capacity as coordinator of the troika of observer
States to the Lusaka Protocol. The United States
subscribes fully to the statement that he will make and
would like to take this opportunity to thank him for his
outstanding service here, both to his country and to this
Organization. We wish him well on his next assignment
and look forward to welcoming his successor.
