The President (spoke in Spanish): There are no
further speakers inscribed on my list. The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

I would like to thank President Preval for his
participation and his briefing, as well as for having
remained with us throughout the debate. I would also
like to thank the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the
Latin American countries who were with us today,
which demonstrates both the importance that Haiti
holds for the region and our commitment towards it.

I think this was a very enriching debate, which
has strengthened the presidential statement
(S/PRST/2011/7), demonstrated to us all the work that
lies ahead in Haiti and illustrated our commitment to
work in coordination with that country. President
Preval and the entire Haitian people can count on a
region and a world that stand alongside him so as to
ensure that Haitian citizens enjoy a better quality of
life.
