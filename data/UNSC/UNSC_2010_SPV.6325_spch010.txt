Mrs. ngu (Nigeria): I thank you, Sir, for
having convened today's meeting. We wish to welcome
the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey. We
acknowledge the presence of the Deputy Secretary-
General, and we thank Assistant Secretary-General
Oscar Fernandez-Taranco for his very lucid briefing.

The Nigerian delegation is dismayed by this
morning's assault on a Gaza-bound aid flotilla, which
resulted in several deaths and injuries. We extend our
sympathies to the families of the dead and wounded.
This incident is not only unfortunate but regrettable, as
it has come at a critical time when two rounds of
proximity talks have already taken place between Israel
and Palestine. All well-meaning people were hopeful
that the two parties would work assiduously for the
resumption of direct negotiations.

The maximum use of force to intercept an
international humanitarian convoy is not only
unnecessary but, more significantly, has created a new
situation that could unleash fresh unrest with grave
consequences for peace in the Middle East. We
therefore call for maximum restraint and urge all
parties to recommit to their roadmap obligations. Even
in the face of such provocation, we must not relent in
our efforts to tread the path of dialogue and long-term
political reconciliation. We call for an urgent and full
inquiry into this unjustified Violence. Those
responsible must be compelled to account for their
actions.

We remain concerned about the deplorable
humanitarian conditions in Gaza. The restrictions and
blockade on Gaza must be lifted to alleviate the
suffering of innocent people.

It is important that security be guaranteed to all
nations and all peoples in the Middle East. The Council
should be united in the message it sends out whenever
there is a clear threat to peace and security. In this
regard, we support the draft presidential statement.
