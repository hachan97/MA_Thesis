The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as representative of Indonesia.

In my national capacity, I would like to once again
express my delegation's appreciation to the Analytical
Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team established
pursuant to paragraph 7 of resolutions 1526 (2004); the
Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate;
the Group of Experts of the Committee established
pursuant to resolution 1540 (2004); and the Office of
the Ombudsperson for carrying out their activities
in accordance with their respective mandates; and to
the secretariats for their dedication in supporting the
Chairs in their daily work.

We must acknowledge that there have been
encouraging developments in advancing our common
goals with regard to the three Committees' mandates,
but we are far from done. We share concerns that,
although the threat has been transformed, it has not
diminished. We believe that the continued collaboration
and unity of the Committee are a prerequisite for the
further development of our future work. We need
the Committee to be united more than ever before.
Therefore, I would like once again to commend the
members of the Committee for their efforts over the
past few months to preserve its credibility and sanctity.

Indonesia, based on procedural rules of the
Committees, will continue to facilitate consultations
and find common ground to bridge various views in
order to ensure the effective functioning of the regimes.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

There are no more names inscribed on the list
of speakers.

The meeting rose at 12.10p.m.
