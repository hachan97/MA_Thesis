The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as representative of the Netherlands.

Today the Security Council sends a strong signal
that it stands united in support of the United Nations
Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO). In particular,
the Council has reaffirmed the political and technical
support that MONUSCO will give to the electoral
process. The Kingdom of the Netherlands firmly
believes that MONUSCO can and must contribute to
the restoration of trust among all parties.

We also welcome the clear benchmarks for the
electoral process. We will continue to monitor them,
together with the implementation of the 31 December
political agreement. We also welcome the addition of a
provision on the protection of peaceful demonstrators
as part of the protection-of-civilians mandate. The
Mission is becoming increasing mobile and agile. We are
therefore pleased with the emphasis on the importance
of community engagement, key enablers and early
warning and response. These are conditions for the
successful implementation of the strategic review.

We look forward to the comprehensive performance
review and efforts to improve the Mission's effectiveness.

Lastly, the Netherlands fully supports the request
to the Secretary-General to carry out contingency
planning. That could be a vital tool for preventing the
conflict from escalating. This is a crucial year for the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, as the country
prepares itself for its first-ever democratic transfer
of power. Today the Council has sent a strong signal
that it not only stands united behind MONUSCO but,
more importantly, behind the people of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

I give the floor to the representative of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.
