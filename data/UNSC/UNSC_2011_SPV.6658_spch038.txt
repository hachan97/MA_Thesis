Ms. Schonmann (Israel): The previous speaker is
deaf to the cries of freedom that continue to come from
the Syrian people in the streets, in broad daylight and
even as we speak. Listening to him just now brings to
mind George Orwell's 1984, where war is peace,
freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength.
That Syria continues to gun down and terrorize
its own people is well known and well documented.
That Syria is one of the world's primary sanctuaries for
terrorist organizations is no secret either. It is common
knowledge that it continues to support, finance and
provide safe haven for terrorist organizations, and that
Damascus is the global headquarters of numerous
terrorist organizations.

While in Israel there is an open and vibrant press,
freedom of speech and a pluralist democratic society,
the Syrian people continue to be oppressed, only
dreaming of living in a democracy. Indeed, whenever a

Syrian representative speaks about terrorism, we
should all appreciate the unique opportunity to gain
some insight into the mind of a State sponsor of
terrorism.
