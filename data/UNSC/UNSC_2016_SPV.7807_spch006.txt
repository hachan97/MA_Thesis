Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Like other members of the Security Council,
we would love to see the swift establishment of
solid peace and stability in Somalia and Eritrea and
throughout the entire Horn of Africa. However, we
were forced to abstain in the voting on resolution 2317
(2016) for the following reasons.

Support by Eritrea to the Al-Shabaab terrorist
group and the border dispute between Djibouti and
Eritrea were the main criteria for imposing restrictive
measures on Asmara in 2009. Since then, however,
the situation on the ground has changed significantly.
In its reports three years in a row, the Monitoring
Group concluded that there was no evidence of Eritrea
providing assistance to Al-Shabaab and that the
border dispute with Djibouti has been settled through
Qatar's mediation. Allegations that Eritrea is allegedly
supporting regional armed groups are uncorroborated.
It therefore looks as ifthe reasons that led to the need to
impose sanctions simply no longer exist. The sanctions
regime against Eritrea has not taken that into account,
and they have remained unchanged. In that regard,
perhaps the time has come to draw up a road map
for the gradual lifting of sanctions against Eritrea, as
suggested by a number of delegations in the course of
work on the resolution.
