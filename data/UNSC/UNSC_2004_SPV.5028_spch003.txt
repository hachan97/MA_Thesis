The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the
representative of Lebanon for his kind words addressed
to me.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution (S/2004/707)
before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the
draft resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Angola, Benin, Chile, France, Germany,
Romania, Spain, United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of
America.

Abstaining:
Algeria, Brazil, China, Pakistan, Philippines,
Russian Federation.

The President (spoke in Spanish): The result of
the voting is as follows: 9 votes in favour, none against
and 6 abstentions. The draft resolution has been
adopted as resolution 1559 (2004).

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
