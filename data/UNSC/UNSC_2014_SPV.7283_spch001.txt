The President (Spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now proceed to the consideration of its
annual report to the General Assembly, for the period
from 1 August 2013 to 31 July 2014.

The draft report has been provided to members of
the Council. The introduction to the draft report was
prepared by the delegation of Rwanda, as President of
the Council in July 2014, with the participation of the
other members of the Council. The body of the report
was prepared by the Secretariat. I should like to express
my appreciation to Rwanda and the Secretariat for their
respective contributions.

I should like to point out that the draft report was
prepared in accordance with the note by the President
of 26 July 2010 (8/2010/507).

I now give the floor to the representative of
Rwanda, whose delegation was responsible for drafting
the introduction to this year's annual report.
