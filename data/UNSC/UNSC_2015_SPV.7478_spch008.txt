Mr. Xu Zhongsheng (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China listened carefully to Prosecutor Bensouda's
briefing. The major problems in Darfur recently have
been the slow progress of the political process, the
refusal of some rebel groups to join the peace process
and the continuing use of violence to undermine the
region's peace and stability. We welcome and support
the efforts of the Sudanese Government and the
relevant rebel groups to push for implementation of the
Doha Document for Peace in Darfur, and we hope that
all the parties concerned will adhere to the principle of
political settlement, join with and actively promote the
Document's implementation and seek a comprehensive
political settlement of the question of Darfur. We hope
that countries that have influence with the rebels will
play a constructive role in that regard. The international
community should also help to create favourable
external conditions for a political settlement of the
question of Darfur.

China's position on the involvement of the
International Criminal Court (ICC) in the issue remains
unchanged. We also believe that the concerns of the
African Union and the countries concerned about the
ICC's involvement should be given full attention.
