The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank the
representative of the Republic of Korea for his kind
words addressed to me.

I should like to take this opportunity to welcome,
on behalf ofthe Council, Mr. Esmat Abdul-Maguid, the
Secretary-General of the League of Arab States, who
has joined us this afternoon.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the

the Council table and to make his statement.
