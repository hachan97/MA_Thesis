Mr. Nishida (Japan): Japan welcomes the
adoption of resolution 1964 (2010). Paragraph 3 of the
resolution states that the Security Council notes the
recommendations on Somalia of the African Union and
that the Council underlines its intention to review the
situation for further decisions on the African Union
Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) beyond what has been
decided today.

We commend Uganda and Burundi for their
sacrifice for and contribution to Somalia through
AMISOM, and we recognize the importance of
supporting their activities. As one of the sponsors of
the resolution, we sincerely hope that the Council will
continue with consultations on how to provide
predictable support to AMISOM. We believe that such
support will help AMISOM. to enhance the security
situation in Somalia, thereby paving the way for the
Transitional Federal Government to advance the
political process. We stand ready to remain involved in
the process in the future.
