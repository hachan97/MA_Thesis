Mr. Zhang Jun (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
representative of Germany commented on my statement
just now, so Iwould like to respond by making two points.
First, before he comments on others' statements, he
should first understand the content of those statements.
If he is confused about them, it might not be appropriate
to make such comments. I emphasized in my statement
that we should consolidate the results that have recently
been achieved in countering terrorism, continue to act in
accordance with Council resolutions and international
law - let me emphasize, international law - unify
standards and combat all forms of terrorism. I have a
personal background in international law. It is common
sense that international law includes international
humanitarian law and everyone should understand that.
I also want to highlight the fact that China has its own
principles and positions that it bases its statements on,
and it is not anyone else's place to lecture or comment
on them.

Secondly, how China votes in the Council, including
on resolutions drafted by the humanitarian penholders,
depends on the merits ofthe case. Our position is based
on our consideration for international peace and security

and for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, security
considerations and humanitarian needs of the country
concerned. It is also based on China's principles and
positions, which we have steadfastly adhered to. We
regard to how we vote, do not have to look to others to
help make our decisions, and it is not Germany's place
to worry about that.
