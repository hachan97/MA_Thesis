Mr. Dejammet (France) (interpretation from French):
Along with the other Council members, France has lent its
support to the draft resolution that is going to be put to the
vote, and given the final draft, we wish to join the other
sponsors. In expressing itself in a unanimous way the
Council demonstrates its unity in the face of an
unacceptable and irrational Iraqi decision. The Council is
acting firmly because Iraq's decision represents a serious
Violation of that country's obligations. By so acting,
Baghdad is turning its back on the Council's clearly
expressed intention to proceed without delay to a
comprehensive review of the implementation of its
resolutions as soon as the restrictions imposed on the
United Nations Special Commission and the International
Atomic Energy Agency on 5 August were lifted.

The draft resolution that we are going to adopt today
restates the Council's intention to carry out this
comprehensive review. It also reaffirms the intention of
the Council
"to act in accordance with the relevant provisions of
resolution 687 (1991) on the duration of the
prohibitions referred to in that resolution".

These provisions, as everyone knows, are embodied in
paragraphs 21 and 22 of Council resolution 687 (1991).

Finally, in its last operative paragraph, the text we
will adopt reaffirms unambiguously the responsibilities
and the prerogatives of the Security Council in the
maintenance of international peace and security,
responsibilities that include evaluating situations as and
when necessary and making the appropriate conclusions.

France appeals to Iraq to seize the opportunity that
the Council is ready to offer it through the undertaking,
initially proposed by the Secretary-General, of a
comprehensive review. The only way for this to be done
and for there to be progress towards lifting the sanctions
that are causing suffering to the Iraqi people is for
Baghdad to rescind without delay the unjustifiable
measures of 5 August and 31 October.
