The President: Thank you, Madam Minister, for
your important statement, your alphabetical A-B-C
suggestion and your interesting suggestion about doing a
meeting of this sort at least once a year, which in my
national capacity I instantly endorse.

It is my pleasure now to continue. Because we have
such a long list of speakers and we will want to break for
lunch in the not-too-distant future, I would hope that the
non-ministerial representatives here would keep their
remarks as short as possible, so that this afternoon we can
have some exchanges of view on what we have heard and
how we might work together.
