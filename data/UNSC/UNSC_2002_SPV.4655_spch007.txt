Mr. Wang Yingfan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
We should like to thank Deputy President Zuma for
coming to New York and for his detailed and
comprehensive briefing to the Council. We should also
like to welcome our new colleague from France,
Ambassador de la Sabliere, to the Council. We believe
that the French delegation will continue to play a
positive and active role in the Security Council, as it
has in the past. China also supports and highly
appreciates the South African Government, especially
Deputy President Zuma, for its efforts to achieve peace
and stability in Burundi.

In Burundi's peace process, the ceasefire
agreement is the key. We are very much pleased that
the agreement has made important progress, but there
are certain problems. As Deputy President Zuma
pointed out, this is a very complicated question. The
Nineteenth Summit Meeting of Heads of State and
Government will continue to pursue efforts in that
regard.

I should like to raise only one question. Under
these circumstances, what does the Deputy President
think the Security Council should do to advance the
peace process in Burundi, especially the signing of the
agreement, and what can the Council do to cooperate
with him in his efforts?
