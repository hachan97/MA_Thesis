The President (spoke in Russian): I wish to
remind all speakers, as I indicated at the morning
meeting, to limit their statements to no more than five
minutes - this, in accordance with the agreement in
the Council - so as to enable the Council to carry out
its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy
statements are kindly requested to circulate the text in
writing and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking in the Chamber.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Pakistan, to whom I give the floor.
