Mr. Rosselli (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): In this
very Chamber, we have already said that we are pained
by the situations in Syria, Yemen, South Sudan and in
all other parts of the world where the civilian population
is subject to the brutalities of war. We have also said in
this very Chamber that, as we give speeches, we are
pained by the fact that bombs continue to fall on the
civilian population, hospitals and schools. In this very
Chamber, we have also said that what is happening in
Aleppo is, without any doubt, a true massacre.

Today, an end to hostilities, bombings and carnage
are of the utmost importance. Allow me to add that
the babies being pulled from the rubble in Aleppo are
not terrorists; the old people crushed in the debris of
their homes are not terrorists; the patients buried in the

rubble of hospitals in Aleppo are not terrorists; and the

children buried in the remains of their schools are not

terrorists.

Regarding the draft resolution in document
S/2016/847, my delegation abstained for reasons of
procedure and of substance. Regarding procedure, the
draft resolution was presented yesterday at 5 pm. as a
take-it-or-leave-it proposition. There was no possibility
of negotiation. Moreover, after briefly reading through
it, we noted that it included a bilateral agreement on
which the Security Council had no say or any reason
for being aware of it. We all know that there is a strong
discrepancy between those members who would sign
the agreement and those who would not, and it is not up
to the Security Council to mediate in that regard.

Regarding substance, the draft resolution does not
address something that is vital at the present stage,
namely, putting an end to the bombing in Aleppo. My
delegation is committed and will continue to work in the
Security Council to relaunch a process of negotiation
that will contribute to ending the current situation and
channeling Syria towards a better future.
