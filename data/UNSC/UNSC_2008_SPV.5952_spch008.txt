Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): We expressed our
concerns last night when we met on this same subject,
and those concerns have only increased today with the
disturbing news of an escalation in the fighting and of
further casualties, including those involving civilians.
The situation on the ground in unclear, but it is
nevertheless dangerous and volatile. Among the events
of today, we have seen reports of the arrival of armed
personnel from other regions, reports of the
bombardment of Georgian positions elsewhere on
Georgian territory by Russian fighter-bombers and
reports of the passage of ground forces from Russia
through the Roki tunnel. The fighting continues, and it
is a threat to peace and security in the region and
beyond.

We support Georgia's sovereignty and territorial
integrity, and I would like to take this opportunity to
call on all members of the Security Council and other
colleagues to reaffirm that. I would also like to take the
opportunity to reiterate calls for a ceasefire and for
withdrawal. We look to the Georgians, the Russians,
the South Ossetians and other fighters to desist from
violence and to use all means to ensure the safety and
security of peacekeepers and of civilians.

Humanitarian assistance cannot be used as a
pretext for the presence of non-Georgian troops, and a
return to the status quo ante, which is obviously
desirable, must be such that it too is effective on non-
Georgian as well as Georgian forces. We also call for
international engagement in a South Ossetian peace
process.

My Government is pleased to support the efforts
outlined by the representative of France, speaking for
the European Union, setting forth what is happening on
mediation from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe and the European Union, and I
commend those efforts to the Security Council. We will
continue to support them.
