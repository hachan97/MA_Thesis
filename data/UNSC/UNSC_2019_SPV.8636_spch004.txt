Mr. Singer Weisinger (DominicanRepublic) (spoke in Spanish): I have the honour to brief the members of
the Security Council in my capacity as Chair of the
Committee established pursuant to resolution 2374
(2017), concerning Mali. In my statement, I intend to
provide information on my role as Chair since the start
of my mandate on 1 January and to highlight the work
conducted by the Committee and the Panel of Experts
since the beginning of the year.

The Committee has met five times since the
beginning of the year. The Committee held informal
consultations on 7 February to consider the midterm
report of the Panel of Experts on Mali (see S/2019/l37),
submitted to the Security Council in accordance with
paragraph 4 of resolution 2432 (2018). Committee
members heard a briefing on 12 April by Ms. Pramila
Patten, Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, on the scourge
of sexual violence in Mali. Since the Committee was
established to date, there have been eight people on
the 2374 (2017) sanctions list. The Committee signed
an agreement with INTERPOL in March to publish
and circulate INTERPOL-Security Council Special
Notices. The Panel of Experts submitted its final report
to the Security Council on 9 August (see S/2019/636),
as mandated by the Security Council.

Lastly, I would like to report that I will be visiting
Bamako from 16 October to 18 October. The visit is a
timely one, as it is a good opportunity to engage with
national authorities and receive updates on the political
and security situation in Mali and the Sahel, including
on the implementation of the Agreement on Peace

and Reconciliation in Mali. It also provides a good
opportunity to explore prospects for future engagement
with countries in the Sahel in order to promote peace and
reconciliation in Mali and stability in the wider region.
