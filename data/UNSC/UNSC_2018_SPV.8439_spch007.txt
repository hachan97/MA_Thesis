Mrs. Cordova Soria (Plurinational State ofBolivia) (spoke in Spanish): Bolivia voted in favour of resolution
2451 (2018) because it is urgent, it is necessary and it is
absolutely essential in order to support the burgeoning
dialogue, which is the only hope for peace for the
Yemeni people today.

We supported the resolution, and we strongly
support the efforts being carried out by the Secretary-
General, the Special Envoy and the United Nations
team to establish a space for negotiations and to provide
Yemen the humanitarian aid that it so desperately needs.

However, we deplore the fact that in the past
24 hours, once again we have witnessed a lack of
transparency and, frankly, a lack of respect, something
that we often see in the Council. Elected members
are the main actors in the issues that are discussed;
we demand to be taken into account. Bolivia has said
this repeatedly during the past few years as a Council
member, and we will continue to say it when our term
is over. We believe that transparency and full equality
among all members of the Council is a goal that remains
to be achieved.
