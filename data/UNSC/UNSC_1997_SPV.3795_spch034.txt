The President (interpretation from Russian): I thank
the representative of Zambia for his kind words addressed
to the previous and present Presidents of the Security
Council.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my list.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 12.30 pm.
