The President: I thank Laurent Fabius for an
eloquent and forceful statement and, on behalf of
everybody, we also thank him for the leadership of
France last week. We appreciated it enormously and
thank him for his literally heroic effort to be here today.
We are very grateful.

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Moussa
Faki Mahamat, Minister for Foreign Affairs and
African Integration of Chad.
