The President: Let me indicate that we are
honoured to have followed up on the Argentine
delegation's work on this issue in the Council. I
promised the predecessor of the representative of
Argentina that when we became a member of the
Council, we would follow-up on this issue.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Mexico.
