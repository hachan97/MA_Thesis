The President (interpretation from French): I thank
the representative of Cape Verde for the kind words he
addressed to me.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to vote on the draft resolution contained in
document S/1996/536. Unless I hear any objection, I shall
put the draft resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements before the voting.
