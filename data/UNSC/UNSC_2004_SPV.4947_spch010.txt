Mr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): My
delegation voted in favour of the draft resolution, but
we deeply regret that the Security Council was unable
to preserve the unity that it has always shown on the
question of Cyprus. This lack of unanimity is
particularly regrettable because it is being
demonstrated at such a crucial moment for the future of
Cyprus, which today is truly at a crossroads, and when
the Council ought to have shown unfailing unity. My
delegation had hoped that the Security Council would
give itself more time to find an honourable compromise
and middle ground. We are convinced that such
compromise and middle ground were within our reach.

Our vote in favour of the draft resolution reflects
our desire to support the Secretary-General's efforts
and to show him our gratitude for what he has been
able to achieve in particularly difficult circumstances.
We voted in favour because the text reflects the will of
the international community and the Security Council
to accompany and support the political process in
Cyprus and to stand by its people. We sincerely hope
that the Security Council's message will be clearly
understood by all.
