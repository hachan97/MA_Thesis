The President: I thank Under-Secretary-General
Amos for her briefing. I know I speak on behalf of the
Security Council in this public meeting in extending our
gratitude and admiration for the selfless contributions
of all humanitarian workers in this conflict and to
those in the United Nations system and the rest of the
international humanitarian system who are doing so
much to bring what relief we can to those suffering.

I now invite Council members to informal
consultations to continue our discussion on the subject.

The meeting rose at 3.15 pm.
