Mr. Verbeke (Belgium) (spoke in French):
Belgium voted for the resolution under consideration.
Through this resolution, the Security Council confirms
the consistent stance that has governed its continuous
commitment to stability and peace in a sovereign and
independent Lebanon. The duty of justice and the fight
against impunity are essential for the stability of
Lebanon. This constancy has always guided the
Council in its work with respect to the establishment of
the International Independent Investigation
Commission and of the international tribunal.

It is this same assessment that guided my
delegation to support and sponsor this new resolution.
This resolution does not prejudice an agreement that
remains to be reached among the Lebanese and which
we continue to call for. By adopting resolution 1757
(2007) today, the Security Council has provided
unreserved support to the efforts of the Government to
strengthen the rule of law that all Lebanese deserve.
