Mr. Ndong Mba (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in Spanish): Our abstention reflects the frustration of the
Republic of Equatorial Guinea with regard to the failure
to adopt a resolution to establish an attribution and
accountability mechanism to identify those responsible
for the use of chemical weapons. We reiterate our call
for a consensus-based resolution that would establish
that mechanism and prevent a repeat of the action we
witnessed yesterday.

In that regard, we recall that the Swedish initiative
was endorsed by the 10 elected members of the Council.
We could introduce the required changes into the draft
resolution to enable its adoption by consensus, which
would allow the mechanism to be established under the
auspices of the Secretary-General.
