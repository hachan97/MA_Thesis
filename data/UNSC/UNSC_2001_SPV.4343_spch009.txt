The President: I thank the Secretary-General for
his gracious presence and for his flexibility, on a very
busy day, in adjusting his timetable to our timetable.
We had been in the consultation room, and we never
know when we will come out of it. I thank him for
waiting for us, and for coming down at the right
moment. We appreciate his presence; I think it gives us
a strong boost in holding this kind of wrap-up. We look
forward to hearing his views about our views.
