Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
endorses the extension of the mandate of the United
Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS). China is closely
following developments in the situation in South
Sudan and hopes that the parties there will effectively
implement the agreement on the resolution of the
conflict in their country and honour their commitment
to the ceasefire so as to restore stability and pursue the
development of their country.

China attaches great importance to the efforts
of the countries of the region to achieve peace and
development in South Sudan, and supports the role of
the Intergovernmental Authority on Development as
the main path to that end. The urgent task before us now
is to find the best way to achieve peace in South Sudan
based on the political and security situation there and
respect for the country's sovereignty.

In the recent attack on UNMISS, two Chinese
peacekeepers lost their precious lives for the cause of
peace. China will continue to unswervingly support
United Nations peacekeeping operations and to increase
its contributions to the cause of international peace.
We appreciate the positive role played by UNMISS in
advancing the peace process in South Sudan. China
supports the ongoing implementation of the UNMISS
mandate.

When discussing the adjustment of mandates, the
Security Council should step up its consultations with
and heed the opinions of the countries concerned and
of those of the region. The Mission should strengthen
capacity-building in the relevant areas so as to effectively
protect the security and safety of peacekeepers. China
is ready to engage with the relevant parties on the issue.
