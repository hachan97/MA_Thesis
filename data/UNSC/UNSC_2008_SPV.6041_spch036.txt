The President: There are no further speakers
inscribed on my list. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.

May I take this opportunity, on behalf of the
Security Council, to thank Judge Robinson, Judge
Byron, Prosecutor Brammertz and Prosecutor Jallow
for taking the time to brief the Security Council.

The meeting rose at 1.45 p.m.
