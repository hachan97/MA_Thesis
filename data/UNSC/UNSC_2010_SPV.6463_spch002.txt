Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian delegation abstained from the
voting for the following reasons.

The adoption of resolution 1966 (2010) by the
Council was a step it was forced to take as a result of
the Tribunals' drawing out their activities. The work of
the Tribunals was to end by the deadlines established
by resolutions 1503 (2003) and 1534 (2004) within the
framework of the completion strategy. The Tribunals
had every opportunity to do so. However, that did not
occur. We firmly believe that today's resolution is the
last on the issue of the duration of the Tribunals'
activities, and that they will be fully wound up by the
end of 2014.

We welcome the contribution of the Austrian
chairmanship of the Informal Working Group on
International Tribunals in reaching today's very
difficult compromise.
