Mr. Cohen (United States of America): The United
States thanks Council members for their endeavours to
ensure that the African Union-United Nations Hybrid
Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) is well positioned
to continue its mission to protect civilians, support
humanitarian aid to 1.2 million internally displaced
persons and assist in the creation of an inclusive
political process in Darfur.

Ongoing armed clashes in the Jebel Marra region
between the Sudan Liberation Movement/Abdul Wahid
al-Nur rebel group and the Sudanese Armed Forces,
intercommunal violence in other parts of Darfur and the
recent attack on civilians in Deleij on 9 June serve as
reminders of the ongoing security challenges that plague
the region. For that reason, we believe that UNAMID
should continue to implement its full mandate.

As security in Khartoum is intrinsically tied to
security in Darfur, the four-month technical rollover
will allow more time for the Rapid Support Forces (RSF)
to remove themselves from team sites, to ensure that
the transfer of future UNAMID headquarters and team
sites are for community use and to remain responsive to
events on the ground. For now, we support the United
Nations decision not to handover facilities or sites to
the RSF and to safeguard the sites for civilian purposes.

The next four months should provide further
clarity on the national political situation. We expect
the Transitional Military Council to transition to a
civilian-led Government that is able to make progress
towards creating the conditions for UNAMID's
planned exit. However, if negotiations stall or security
conditions continue to deteriorate, we will look more
closely at the planned UNAMID drawdown. We urge
all stakeholders to make significant progress on putting
in place a civilian-led transitional Government in the
coming months.
