Mr. Xu Zhongsheng (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China voted in favour of resolution 2297 (2016). The
Somali peace process is currently at a critical juncture.
Holding general elections in August, as scheduled,
will establish conditions conducive to Somalia's
achievement of peace, stability and development as
soon as possible.

The Council visited Somalia in May, and today
it unanimously adopted a resolution extending the
mandate of the African Union Mission in Somalia
(AMISOM), demonstrating the international
community's commitment to helping the Federal
Government of Somalia to take the political process
forward, uproot the threat posed by Al-Shabaab, and
expedite the country's peaceful reconstruction.

China is grateful to the African Union and the
countries of the region, which have consistently made
great contributions and sacrifices in order to maintain
the security and stability of Somalia. China hopes
that, in the light of the demands of the countries of the
region, the international community will help Somalia
and AMISOM. to strengthen their capacity-building,
and in particular provide the Mission with consistent
and stable logistical support and give Somalia robust
assistance in advancing the political process and
promoting economic and social development.

The meeting rose at 11.15 am.
