The President: I shall now speak briefly in my
national capacity.

I support the United Kingdom in submitting
short resolutions. I think that this kind of thing is
expected by colleagues in the Chamber. Ijoin others in
congratulating the United Kingdom on the resolution.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

The representative of South Africa has asked for
the floor to make a further statement.
