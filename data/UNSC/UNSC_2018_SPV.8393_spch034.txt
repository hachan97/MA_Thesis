The President (spoke in Chinese): I thank our
briefers for their very good interactive discussions this
afternoon. On behalf of the members of the Council,
I wish to thank Assistant Secretary-General Zouev,
the Police Commissioners and other speakers for their
oustanding contributions to the work of the Council. I
wish them every success as they carry out their tasks.
