Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): Recent
reports concerning the use of chemical weapons
in Douma and the consequent civilian casualties
have given rise to serious concern on the part of the
international community. China has noted that the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
(OPCW) has already asked its Fact-finding Mission in
the Syrian Arab Republic to investigate the relevant
reports. We support the OPCW in sending investigators
to Syria so as to establish the truth. We call on all
parties concerned to cooperate with the investigation.

The draft resolution submitted by the Russian
Federation (S/2018/322) expresses deep concern about
the alleged use of chemical weapons in Douma on
7 April, strongly condemns the chemical-weapons
attacks that took place in Syria and elsewhere, urges
the OPCW Fact-finding Mission to carry out an on-site
investigation, and provides that the Syrian Government
and other parties will ensure the security of and safe
access to investigators. The draft resolution is in keeping
with China's principled position. China supports and
voted in favour of the Russian draft resolution.
