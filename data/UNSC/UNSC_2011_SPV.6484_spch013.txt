Mr. Manjeev Singh Puri (India): Consistent
with our long-standing position of solidarity with the
Palestinian people and our position that the settlements
in the occupied Palestinian territories are illegal under
international law, India co-sponsored the draft
resolution and voted in its favour. It is our sincere hope
and expectation that wiser counsel will prevail among
the parties concerned and that the path of dialogue will
be the path followed to realize peace in the region.

Even though the Council today could not adopt
the resolution, we expect that the sentiments expressed
by its members will impel the parties to serious
introspection and to the realization that the only way to
resolve the problem is to restart talks on all pending
issues so that a lasting peace is established and that -
as mentioned by many in the Council today - by
September 2011 we can welcome to the international
community an independent, viable and united State of
Palestine, living within secure and recognized borders,
with East Jerusalem as its capital, side by side and at
peace with Israel.
