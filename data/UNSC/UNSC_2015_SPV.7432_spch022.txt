The President: I can assure Ambassador McLay
that it is not goodbye but farewell, and we look forward
to his future contributions in any capacity. His wisdom
and experience are much needed in today's volatile
world. I thank him sincerely and I am sorry that we
worked him very hard right to the end, but that was
intentional.
