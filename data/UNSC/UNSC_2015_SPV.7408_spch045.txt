Ms. Honore: I thank the President and all members
of the Security Council for the observations that have
been made and the recommendations that have been put
forward with a view to bolstering the work of the United
Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH)
in support of the full development of Haiti's electoral
management capacity, the professionalization of the
Haitian National Police, the strengthening of the rule
of law, the promotion and protection of human rights
and the role of good offices. I would like to also extend
my thanks to all the other Member States, including
the Republic of Haiti, as well as the multilateral
organizations that have commented on the report of the
Secretary-General (S/2015/157) that was the object of
consideration by the Council at this meeting.

On behalf of all Mission personnel - military,
police and civilians, both international and Haitian,
as well as United Nations Volunteers - I also wish

to express deep appreciation for the many statements
of encouragement for the work of MINUSTAH as we
pursue our efforts with the Government of Haiti and
its international partners, as well as the United Nations
country team, in support of and in service to the people
of Haiti.
