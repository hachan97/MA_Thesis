Mr. Olson (United States of America): I will take
the floor only briefly, just to welcome the Minister and
to thank him for his very comprehensive briefing and
assure him and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) of both my delegation
and the Council's continued support in carrying out our
entirely complementary agendas.

I would like to ask the Minister if he could
provide just a little bit more information on the role he
feels the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human
Rights could play in encouraging the growth of
democratic institutions both in Europe and in Eurasia.
