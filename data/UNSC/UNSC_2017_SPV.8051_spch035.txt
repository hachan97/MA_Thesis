The President: I wish to remind all speakers to
limit their statements to no more than four minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements
are kindly requested to circulate their texts in writing
and deliver a condensed version when speaking in
the Chamber.

I now invite His Excellency Mr. Jacob Zuma,
President of South Africa, to take the floor.
