The President (spake in Russian): There are no
further speakers on my list.
Before 1 close the meeting 1 would like to say

that. as far as I understand. contacts among interested
delegations have as yet not led to a situation in which

the Council could directly take up consideration of a
draft resolution in consultations. These contacts will
continue during the lunch break, and we shall hold
consultations at 4 pm.

The meeting rose at 1.15pm.
