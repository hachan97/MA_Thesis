The President: At this point, I would like to thank
all delegations for their willingness to continue the
debate through the lunch hour in order to accommodate
the very large number of speakers, which is an indication
of the significant level of interest in this critical issue.
We thank everyone for their presence and participation
here today, but as we start our session this afternoon,
I would like to take this opportunity to remind all
speakers that they should try to limit their statements to
no more than four minutes in order to enable the Council
to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with
lengthier statements are kindly requested to circulate
the text in writing and deliver a more condensed version
when speaking in the Chamber.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Malaysia.
