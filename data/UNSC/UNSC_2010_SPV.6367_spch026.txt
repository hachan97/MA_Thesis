The President (spoke in Russian): I believe that
it is wrong to offer a selective reading of history, just
as it is wrong to quote selectively from the opinion of
the International Court of Justice.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 5.25 pm.
