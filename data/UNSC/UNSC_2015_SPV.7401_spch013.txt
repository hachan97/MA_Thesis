Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): That logic is completely distorted. I would
even put it another way. It is very strange that the
United States stated that the use of chemical weapons
by the Government of Syria would be a red line and that
it would cause the Unites States to use force, and yet
after the events of 21 August it did not do so. Therefore,
the Al-Assad Government did not cross that red line.
The President of the United States stated that it was a
red line and then he did nothing. That means that the
Al-Assad Government did not use chemical weapons.
It is not just my assumption. Many observers think the
same thing.

The meeting rose at 1.10 pm.
