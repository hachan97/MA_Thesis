Mr. Cardi (Italy): I would like to thank you
in particular, Mr. President, for calling today's
meeting. I also offer my thanks to Under-Secretary-
General Feltman for his briefing on the report of the
Secretary-General (S/2017/515), and to Ambassador
Vale de Almeida for his briefing on behalf of
Ms. Federica Mogherini.

Today I will touch on three aspects of my report for
the period from 16 January 2017 through 15 June 2017:
first, the activities of the Security Council in the "2231
format"; secondly, monitoring of the implementation of
resolution 2231 (2015); and, thirdly, developments in the
procurement channel and other requests for approval.
The full version of the report has been circulated to
Council members and has been issued under the symbol
S/2017/537.

First, with regard to the 2231 format, following
the Security Council's informal consultations on
the 29 January 2017 ballistic-missile launch by the
Islamic Republic of Iran, the Council held a meeting
on 2 March in the 2231 format to further consider the
launch. I will summarize our discussion in the second
part of my briefing.

On 17 March, the Security Council held a meeting in
the 2231 format to hear a briefing from the Coordinator
of the Procurement Working Group of the Joint
Commission established in the Joint Comprehensive
Plan ofAction (JCPOA). In his briefing, the Coordinator
gave an overview of the procurement channel and of
the Procurement Working Group's functions, activities,
processing of proposals and various benchmarks.
During the same meeting, the Council also agreed to
shift the reporting schedule on resolution 2231 (2015)
implementation from July-January to June-December,
thereby allowing the Facilitators to brief the Council
after six months into and at the end of their terms.

In line withparagraph4 ofthe resolution, in February
and June 2017, the Director General of the International
Atomic Energy Agency submitted two quarterly reports
on verification and monitoring activities. The February
report recalled that on 15 January 2017, the Agency
verified that Iran had taken the actions specified in
annex V of the JCPOA, namely, the removal of all
excess centrifuges and infrastructure from the Fordow
Fuel Enrichment Plant and their transfer to storage at
the Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant under continuous
Agency monitoring. In addition, the Agency indicated
that, on 21 January, the Islamic Republic of Iran, under
Agency verification and monitoring, began feeding
natural UF6 into a single IR-8 centrifuge for the
first time.

In both quarterly reports, the Agency affirmed
that the Islamic Republic of Iran had not pursued the
construction of the existing Arak heavy water research
reactor based on its original design; had no more than
130 metric tonnes of heavy water; had no more than
5,060 centrifuges that have remained installed in 30
cascades at Natanz; had not enriched uranium above
3.67 per cent U-235; had not conducted any uranium
enrichment or related research and development
activities at Fordow; and that there had not been any
nuclear material at the plant.

On 2 March 2017, at the 2231 format meeting, the
experts of one Member State observed that the medium-
range ballistic missile, a Khorramshahr, tested by the
Islamic Republic of Iran on 29 January was designed to
carry a payload greater than 500 kilograms to a range
over 1,000 kilometres (km). The experts noted that

"500 kg has been the approximate mass required
to carry a first-generation nuclear weapon and
300 km is an internationally accepted range of
strategic significance".

They concluded that the test constituted an activity
related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of
delivering nuclear weapons.

Following the briefing, the issue of the particular
sensitivity of the launch, with regard to its regional
implications and its relation to resolution 2231 (2015),
raised by some representatives, was discussed. A
representative emphasized that resolution 2231
(2015) does not provide a definition as to which
types of missiles are constructed in such a manner
as to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons. Other
delegations said that resolution 2231 (2015) concerns
intrinsic capability rather than intent. Since the launch
involved a system that was, by design, capable of
delivering a nuclear warhead, its use was therefore
inconsistent with resolution 2231 (2015).

In the light of the views expressed by delegations,
I noted that there was no consensus on how this
particular launch relates to resolution 2231 (2015). I
stressed that it was essential for the Security Council
to act in a unified manner in this area, so as to help
foster the effective implementation of resolution 2231
(2015). I also proposed that, in the framework of my
regular contacts with interested parties, including the
Permanent Representative of Iran, I would underline the
importance, for all parties, of continuing to maintain an
attitude conducive to building trust and to implement
the terms of the JCPOA and resolution 2231 (2015).

With respect to procurement channel developments
and other requests of approval, since implementation
day a total of 16 proposals to participate in or permit
the activities set forth in paragraph 2 of annex B to
resolution 2231 (2015) have been submitted to the
Security Council by four Member States from three
different regional groups, including States that are not
participants in the JCPOA. That reflects the growing
confidence of Member States in the procurement
channel. I am also pleased to note that, on average,
the proposals were processed through the procurement
channel in less than 46 calendar days.

A proposal to participate in and permit the
activities set forth in paragraph 5 of annex B to
resolution 2231 (2015) was submitted on 23 November
2016 by a Member State that, on 24 February, provided
additional information. On 28 February, I informed that
Member State that the Security Council had reached no
agreement and returned its request.

In conclusion, 18 months after implementation day,
transparency, practical guidance and outreach remain
a priority. In that regard, I plan to engage in new
outreach activities on the implementation of resolution
2231 (2015) during the second part of my tenure. In
the short term, on 14 July, I intend to convene an open
briefing for States Member of the United Nations to
raise awareness and understanding of the resolution
and its implementation.
