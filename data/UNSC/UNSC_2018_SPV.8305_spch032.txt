The President: Before moving on, I want to really
express the appreciation of Sweden for the strong
commitment and engagement of everyone during
the debate this morning. It is sometimes tempting to
express that commitment through very long statements,
as we know. Ijust have to remind speakers to limit their
statements to no more than three minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.

To that end, let me take the opportunity to remind
speakers that the presidency will use the flashing lights
on the collars of the microphones to remind speakers
that it is time to sum up and bring their remarks to a
close. Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to circulate the text in writing and to deliver
a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.

I wish to inform representatives that we will be
carrying on this open debate through the lunch hour
as we have a large number of speakers to listen to
this afternoon.

I now give the floor to the representative
of Colombia.
