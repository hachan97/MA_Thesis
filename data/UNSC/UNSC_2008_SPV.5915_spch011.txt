The President: On behalf of the Council, I
should like to express appreciation to all of the
members of the Security Council and of the Secretariat
who participated in the mission, which was very ably
led by Ambassadors Kumalo, Sawers, Ripert and
Kafando, for the manner in which they discharged their
important responsibilities on behalf of the Council.

I should also like to express appreciation to the
men and women from around the world who are
serving in United Nations peacekeeping operations in
Africa and to all those who facilitated this mission.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 11.15 am.
