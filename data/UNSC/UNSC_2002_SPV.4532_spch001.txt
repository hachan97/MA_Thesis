The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Burundi, the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, Rwanda, South Africa and Spain, in which
they request to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the discussion without the right to
vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Nteturuye
(Burundi), Mr. Atoki (Democratic Republic of the Congo), Mr. Gasana (Rwanda), MrKumalo
(South Africa) and Mr. Arias (Spain) took the
seats reservedfor them at the side of the Council
table.

The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2002/537, containing the report of the
Security Council mission to the Great Lakes region,
from 27 April to 7 May 2002. Members also have
before them photocopies ofthe addendum to the report,
which will be issued as a document of the Security
Council.

I call on Mr. Jean-David Levitte, Head of the
Security Council mission to the Great Lakes region.
