Mr. Uanivi (Namibia): Thank you, Mr. President,
for convening this important meeting on the
implementation of the peace process in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. We would also like to thank Under-
Secretary-General Miyet for his valuable briefing on
the current developments in the country.

We note with appreciation the overall improved
situation within which the programme on police reform
and restructuring continues to make incremental
progress. In this regard, Namibia acknowledges the
activities of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and
Herzegovina (UNMIBH) in assisting local authorities
with meeting their obligations, inter alia, to institute a
common Border Service, to increase minority police
recruitment and/or transfer minority police officers to
various locations throughout the country; and to attract
displaced and former police officers to return to their
pre-war homes and rejoin the local police forces there.
In addition there is the ongoing registration programme
geared towards establishing a personnel data bank of
authorized police officers in country.

We appreciate also the rate of return of refugees
and internally displaced persons to the pre-war areas;
however, we take serious note of the open
obstructionism and lack of political will on the part of
local authorities with respect to the implementation of
the property laws.

In conclusion, my delegation wishes to commend
all the personnel of the various international
institutions, including the United Nations Mission in
Bosnia and Herzegovina and the International Police
Task Force, who have dedicated their lives and their
time to a good cause: to help the people of Bosnia and
Herzegovina reconstruct their lives and build a multi-
ethnic society.
