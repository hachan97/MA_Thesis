Mr. Scheffers (Netherlands): In view of the late
hour and therefore the general desire to exhaust the list
of speakers, I will be brief.

Like other delegations, we attach the highest
priority to the preparations for the municipal elections
to be held this fall. We welcome the fact that
Mr. Kouchner has now signed the regulation on the
conduct of these elections. We should therefore
continue convincing the Kosovo Serbs that it is in their
own interest to participate in these elections, meant to
establish local self-government as a major step towards
a truly multi-ethnic Kosovo. We also therefore continue
to be concerned at the ongoing violence committed
against the minority communities, the personnel of the
Kosovo Force (KFOR) and local politicians, including
recent clashes among the Albanian parties themselves.

We have expressed our strong support for
Mr. Kouchner on several occasions, but this time we do
so with added conviction on account of his special
arrangements for Kosovo Serbs. We reject the criticism
voiced by some Albanian quarters that these undermine
the principle of a unified and multi-ethnic Kosovo. In
the present circumstances, additional protection for
minorities is more than justified. We therefore call on
Mr. Hashim Thaci to resume his participation in the
Joint Interim Administrative Structure as soon as
possible.
