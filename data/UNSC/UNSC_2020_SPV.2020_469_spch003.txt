I would like to thank all delegations for their constructive engagement during the negotiation process on resolution S/2020/453, extending the sanctions regime for South Sudan. The Niger voted in favour of the resolution, while being mindful of the principled position of the African Union on its rejection of the imposition of sanctions on any African country. Our vote was also guided, on the one hand, by the flexibility shown by members in accommodating the majority of our requirements in the resolution, and, on the other hand, by the provisions of paragraph 4 for the possibility of reviews in a bid to lifting the sanction measures early, which is the ultimate goal of the Council. We commend the authorities in South Sudan for their willingness and efforts, so far, in the implementation of the Revitalized Agreement, as is proven by the formation of the Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity. We encourage the parties to work in confirming this positive trend we all salute. Once again, my delegation reiterates its full support to the peace process in South Sudan, and hopes to see the peace gains further consolidated for an early lifting of the sanctions in their entirety.
