Mr. Guehenno: Let me say how pleased we are
that so many delegations have stressed the importance
of security for Afghanistan. Security has many facets
in Afghanistan, and I would like to clarify that, indeed,
the threats of Al Qaeda and the Taliban remain a great
source of concern. We have seen the effects of such
threats on our staff. I would like to clarify that when
we talk about extremist elements, we indeed refer to
such elements as Al Qaeda and the Taliban.

It is unfortunately also clear that security in
Afghanistan has many facets and that dealing with the
question of factionalism, to which I referred again in
today's briefing, is also important for the stabilization
of the country. The unfortunate events in Herat, to
which I referred, are an illustration of the dangers of
factionalism for peaceful elections.

I would like to conclude, in that respect, on the
importance of disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration (DDR), without which the strength of
Afghanistan will be considerably undermined. So I
think that if we want to consolidate security in
Afghanistan, we have to work on several fronts. The
major contribution made by Operation Enduring
Freedom in the fight against Al Qaeda and the Taliban
is to be commended. The efforts of the international
community to build the Afghan national army are
important. The role of the provincial reconstruction
teams (PRTs) in stabilizing the region is essential. The
contribution of Japan and other countries to DDR is
vital to the stability of Afghanistan.
