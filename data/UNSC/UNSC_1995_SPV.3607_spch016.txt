Mr. Bakuramutsa (Rwanda)(interpretation from French): The delegation of Rwanda would like to thank and
commend the countries that have helped to promote peace
in the former Yugoslavia and have made it possible to put
an end to four years of war. We also welcome the
negotiated political settlement of the conflicts in the former
Yugoslavia, particularly as regards the preservation of the
territorial integrity of all States within their internationally
recognized borders.

My delegation also welcomes the fact that these
agreements put an end to a war which has caused suffering
to innocent people, particularly women and children and
others who did not take part in the fighting, and has caused
the death of hundreds of thousands of people, many of
whom died an atrocious death - for nothing.

My delegation notes with satisfaction that the draft
resolution has a clause on the International Tribunal for the
Former Yugoslavia. We firmly hope that the persons who
have committed crimes against humanity will be
prosecuted, that the prevailing impunity in this region and
in the Great Lakes region will be lifted and that this will
serve as an example for the world.

My delegation would like to conclude by expressing
a wish - a request to the Council and the States Members
of this Organization - that the impressive means which

 

have just been made available to the former Yugoslavia
to ensure respect for peace, and that the energy and speed
used to arrive at this draft resolution and to implement it
may provide a good example to be followed in the future
and applied in the same way and without discrimination
to any Member State of this Organization that finds itself
in need.

Rwanda will vote in favour of this draft resolution.
