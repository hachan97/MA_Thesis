Mr. Alotaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I hope
that this is the last time that I ask for the floor. Honestly,
it is unacceptable for the Syrian representative a or
others - to say implicitly or explicitly that Kuwait is
accused of being involved in terrorism.

I would like to correct the information that the
Syrian representative mentioned in his latest statement
on Shafi Al-Ajmi. This individual is listed on the lists
of the Sanctions Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1267 (1999). He was designated pursuant
to a decision by the Security Council. Back then, we
were not a member of the Security Council to be able to
oppose that decision.

The meeting rose at 12.45 p.m.
