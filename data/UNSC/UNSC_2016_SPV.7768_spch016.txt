Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian delegation supported resolution
2307 (2016) and hopes that it will lead to a final
settlement in Colombia.

The agreement reached in Havana between the
Government of Colombia and the Fuerzas Armadas
Revolucionarias de Colombia - Ejercito del Pueblo
(FARC-EP) is key to the pacific settlement of more
than half a century of inter-Colombian conflict. The
agreement opens a new chapter for the country in terms
of national reconciliation and development.

We congratulate the parties to the dialogue and the
Colombian people on this victory. We note the political
resolve involved in finding a compromise solution that
was displayed by the participants in the negotiation
process and the significant mediation efforts deployed
by the guarantors, Cuba and Norway, assisted by
Venezuela and Chile. A considerable contribution has
been made to the promotion of peace in Latin America,
to the bolstering of regional stability and to reaffirming
the effectiveness of legal political means in solving
long-standing, even very difficult, problems.

We hope for a swift conclusion to the preparation
period for the practical implementation of the provisions
of the Final Agreement. We are prepared to continue
to assist Colombia, both bilaterally and multilaterally,
by providing international assistance to the settlement
process and to ensuring that the necessary post-conflict
changes take place.
