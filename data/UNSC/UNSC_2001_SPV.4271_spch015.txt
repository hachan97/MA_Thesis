The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank the
representative of Ireland for his kind words addressed
to me.

Before giving the floor to the next speaker, I
would like to kindly request the members of the
Council to be as brief as possible in their statements so
as to allow time for President Joseph Kabila to
comment on the Council members' important
statements if he wishes.
