The President (spoke in Spanish): There are no
further speakers left on my list.

After consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council welcomes the
briefing by the Chairman of the Counter-
Terrorism Committee (CTC) on the work of the
Committee.

"The Security Council recalls the statement
of its President of 8 October 2002
(S/PRST/2002/26), which recorded its intention
to review the structure and activities of the CTC
no later than 4 April 2003. The Council thanks
Ambassador Greenstock (United Kingdom) for
his chairmanship of the CTC during the first 18
months of its work, and confirms the appointment
of Ambassador Arias (Spain) as the new
Chairman. The Council confirms the continuation
in office of Ambassador Gaspar Martins
(Angola), Ambassador Aguilar Zinser (Mexico)
and Ambassador Lavrov (Russian Federation) as
Vice-Chairmen of the Committee.

"The Council invites the CTC to pursue its
agenda as set out in the work programme for the
CTC's seventh 90-day period (S/2003/387).

"The Council notes that three States have
not yet submitted a report to the CTC, and that 51
Member States are late in submitting a further
report, in contravention of the requirements set
out by resolution 1373 (2001). It calls on them
urgently to do so, in order to maintain the
universality of response which resolution 1373
(2001) requires.

"The Security Council invites the CTC to
continue reporting on its activities at regular
intervals and expresses its intention to review the
structure and activities of the CTC no later than 4
October 2003."

This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2003/3.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 5.45 pm.
