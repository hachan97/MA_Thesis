Mr. Gaspar Martins (Angola): We welcome the
convening of this meeting this afternoon, and thank
Under-Secretary-General Feltman for the very in-depth
briefing that he provided to the Council.

The crisis in Ukraine has serious consequences for
the political, economic and social stability of its people,
and we agree that all peaceful means must be found to
resolve it. The Minsk agreement signed in September
is an important basis for a settlement as long as all the
parties concerned can demonstrate the political will to
make it a reality, in spirit as well as in letter. We know
that a round of negotiations was scheduled for this
afternoon in Berlin between the Ministers for Foreign
Affairs of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany.
It is our conviction that it will be possible to reach a
negotiated solution if the parties have the political will.
That would certainly be a welcome development for the
Council at the beginning of a new year and with the
restart of our deliberations on this crisis.

The humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine is
deplorable, and it is unacceptable that so many people
continue to be killed, maimed and deprived of food,
clean water, housing and other essentials of human life,
especially given the extremely cold winter they are
living through.

Finally, Angola appeals to all the parties directly
or indirectly involved in the conflict to use their
intelligence to find possible solutions to safeguarding
international peace and security in this conflict.
