Mr. Ladsous (France) (interpretation from French):
The French delegation, which actively participated in the
preparatory work on the draft resolution, supported the text
just adopted unanimously by the Council. Indeed, the
resolution will provide an essential tool for the long-term
monitoring of dual-use goods and technologies in Iraq, once
the current sanctions regime has been lifted. In this
connection, it was important for a mechanism governing the
imports and exports of such items to be adopted before
paragraph 22 of resolution 687 (1991) is applied.

Naturally, I join in the thanks expressed to the
Ambassador of Germany in his capacity as chairman of the
Committee established under resolution 661 (1990); to those
concerned in the International Atomic Energy Agency; and
to the Special Commission, for the work they carried out in
preparing the resolution.
