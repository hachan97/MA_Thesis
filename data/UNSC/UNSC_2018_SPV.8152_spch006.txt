Mr. Inchauste Jordan (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): First and foremost, given
that this is the first open meeting of the Security
Council, I should like, on behalf of the delegation
of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, to once again
congratulate the Kazakhstan delegation on assuming
the presidency of the Council for this month and to
assure it of our support.

The Bolivian delegation believes that the holding
of this meeting is not a welcome initiative, because,
as has been the case in the past, we are witnessing
a blatant attempt by some Missions to bring to the
attention of the Security Council issues that do not
fall within the purview of this body. We categorically
reject the undisguised attempts by some delegations to
push for meetings on issues that do not pose a threat to
international peace and security, which in the long term
risks the Security Council being instrumentalized for
political ends.

It must be crystal-clear to the international
community that the situation in the Islamic Republic
of Iran is not an issue that belongs on the agenda of the
Security Council, and we are concerned at attempts to
force its inclusion in the Security Council agenda as
part of the broader Middle East agenda item.

The position ofthe Plurinational State ofBolivia was
made abundantly clear by President Evo Morales, who
condemned in the strongest possible terms any threat to
intervene or interfere in internal affairs of the people
and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
We are convinced that, as history has proved time and
again, unilateral action and policies of interventionism
and regime change can only ever lead to devastating
humanitarian, social and economic consequences, the
repercussions of which we are still seeing today, in
some cases in the context of issues that are before the
Security Council.

On this occasion, we would echo the Movement
of Non-Aligned Countries, which has time and again
reiterated its commitment to respecting the sovereignty,
national unity and territorial integrity of States;
upholding the sovereign equality of States and the
principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of
States; the peaceful solution of disputes; and abstaining
from the use or threat of use of force.

Finally, Bolivia is convinced that any internal
conflict of any State around the world must be resolved
in the framework of that country's own practices and
in line with its own sovereign principles, without any
external interference.
