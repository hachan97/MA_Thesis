The President: The Security Council will
continue its consideration of the item on the agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

After consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council welcomes with
appreciation the comprehensive briefing provided
by the Secretary-General's Special Adviser Mr.
Lakhdar Brahimi.

"Recalling its Presidential Statement of 24
March 2004 the Security Council considers the
efforts of the Special Adviser and his team as
well as those of the UN electoral assistance team
to be of particular importance and urgency.

"The Security Council strongly supports the
efforts and dedication of the Special Adviser and
welcomes the provisional ideas he has submitted
as a basis for the formation of an interim Iraqi
government to which sovereignty will be
transferred on 30 June 2004.

"The Security Council encourages the
Secretary General and his Special Adviser to
continue diligently with the efforts that they are
employing, and welcomes the Special Adviser's
intention to return to Iraq shortly and looks
forward to a further briefing upon his return.

"The Security Council calls on all Iraqi
parties to cooperate fully with the Special
Adviser, and also calls on Iraq's neighbours and
the international community at large to lend all
support possible to these efforts."

This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol
S/PRST/2004/11.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on the
agenda.
The meeting rose at 6.15 p.m.
