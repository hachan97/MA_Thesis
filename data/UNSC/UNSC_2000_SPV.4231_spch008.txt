Mr. Ouane (Mali) (spoke in French): Mali
associates itself fully with the statement which will
shortly be made by South Africa on behalf of the
Movement of the Non-Aligned. I should also like, in
my capacity as Coordinator of the Non-Aligned Caucus
in the Security Council for November to associate the
other members of the Caucus with that statement.

Nevertheless I wish here, in my national capacity,
to make a few brief comments. First, to recall the
constant position of Mali in favour of a just and lasting
settlement of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. In that
respect, we firmly condemn the violence of the last
week which led to numerous casualties in the civilian
population, in particular, the Palestinian population.
We deplore the escalation of this violence and its
growing socio-economic repercussions. We would urge
the parties to show greater restraint in order to restore
calm and promote the resumption of dialogue.

And secondly, Mali fully supports the efforts of
the Secretary-General, particularly the four priority
objectives that he defined at the Security Council
meeting on 17 November.

Also, the agreements of Sharm el-Sheikh offered
some promise for the peace process, which is why we
would urge the parties to implement those accords
strictly.

Mali welcomes the talks in Washington and all
efforts to achieve peace.

My third comment relates to the dispatching of
observers to the field. This is a positive measure that
could usefully contribute to the cessation of violence.
The Council should attribute to it the highest priority.
This is a requirement of the international community
and the Organization's credibility is at stake.
