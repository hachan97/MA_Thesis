Mr. Yao Shaojun (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China attaches great importance to the issue of persons
with disabilities in conflict. We support parties to
conflicts in providing protection tailored to the special
needs of people with disabilities in accordance with
international humanitarian law. Efforts should also
focus on reducing disabilities as a result of conflict.

The Council's unanimous adoption today of
resolution 2475 (2019) demonstrates the principled
consensus of all parties on this issue. China voted in
favour of the resolution. The key to tackling the issue
lies in stamping out the root causes of armed conflict.
The Council should act in earnest on its primary duty
to maintain international peace and security and work
assiduously to prevent and address conflicts through
dialogue, negotiations and consultations in order to
minimize the impact of armed conflict on vulnerable
groups, including those with disabilities.

The Council should not replicate or replace the work
of human rights agencies or social welfare agencies
dedicated to those with disabilities. This issue is a
sub-item under the agenda for the protection of civilians
in armed conflict, and should be addressed in full
observance of all Council resolutions and agreements on
that agenda. The Governments of countries in situations
of armed conflict should play a primary role and take on
the primary responsibility in tackling matters related to
persons with disabilities. The international community
should give them assistance with capacity-building,
and non-governmental organizations should play a
constructive role while fully respecting the sovereignty
of the countries concerned.
