Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
wish to thank Mr. Audronius AZubalis, Foreign
Minister of Lithuania, for his briefing on behalf of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE).

China attaches great importance to cooperation
between the United Nations and regional and
subregional organizations in the maintenance of
international peace and security. In fulfilling its
primary responsibility of maintaining international
peace and security, the Security Council needs the
important support and cooperation of regional and
subregional organizations. In particular, the Council
and those organizations should make use of their
advantages and complement each other in a common
effort to promote international peace and security.

The OSCE is an important regional organization
in Europe in terms of maintaining international peace
and security. It is also an important cooperative partner
of the United Nations. We commend the contributions
of the OSCE to preventive diplomacy, dispute
mediation, post-conflict peacebuilding and counter-
terrorism.

We encourage the OSCE to continue to make use
of its advantages and to play a positive role in
maintaining regional peace, security and stability. We
also support the initiatives of the United Nations and
the Security Council to cooperate more pragmatically
and effectively with the OSCE, on the basis of the
Charter of the United Nations, in the maintenance of
regional peace and security.
