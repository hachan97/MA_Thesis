Mr. Hickey (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom welcomes the adoption of resolution
2460 (2019). We recognize the diligent work of the
co-penholders. However, we also regret that it was not
possible to adopt a more comprehensive resolution with
a l2-month mandate.

The forthcoming presidential elections mean that
Afghanistan faces some crucial months ahead. As we
have all recognized, it is important that lessons are
learned from the earlier parliamentary elections to
ensure a transparent, credible and inclusive presidential
vote on 20 July. To that end, we believe that the United
Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA)
has a crucial role to play and that it will be important
for UNAMA to work closely and urgently with the
new election commissioners in identifying priorities
and challenges.

As progress is made, the meaningful participation
of women at all levels of decision-making, from the
local community to the negotiation table, is essential.
The sustained and empowered involvement of women
makes any peace process more likely to succeed. We
reiterate that any political settlement should protect the
progress achieved on human rights and gender equality
in Afghanistan over the past 18 years.

Millions of Afghans face extreme difficulties amid
a complex humanitarian situation. The United Kingdom
agrees with the Russian Federation that UNAMA has
an important role in leading the international response,
and we urge UNAMA and the Afghan Government to
work together to support the most vulnerable.
