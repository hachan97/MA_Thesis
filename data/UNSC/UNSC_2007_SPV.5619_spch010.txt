Mr. Ikouebe (Congo) (spoke in French): Last
September, my delegation cast a negative vote with
regard to the procedural decision that led to the
inscription of the situation in Myanmar on the
Council's agenda. That position is in line with that of
the Non-Aligned Movement and of Myanmar's
7

neighbouring countries in the context of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Those
countries believe that the situation in Myanmar does not
constitute a threat to international peace and security.

Quite logically, Congo could have voted today
against the draft resolution that has just been rejected.
That was our intention. However, in the spirit of
reconciliation, my delegation preferred to abstain, in
the hope that the sponsors of the draft resolution would
be able to find other ways to address this problem,
which pertains above all to the competency and
sovereignty of Member States. In any case, we believe
this matter falls under the purview of other United
Nations bodies other than the Security Council.

My delegation would therefore encourage the
Secretary-General's good offices mission to improve
the situation in the country through dialogue. To date,
the mission being carried out by Mr. Gambari has
helped us to discern real and encouraging prospects.
We continue to support those efforts.
