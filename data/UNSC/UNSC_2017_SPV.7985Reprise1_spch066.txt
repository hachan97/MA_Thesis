Mr. Denktas (Turkey): I will not dignify with
a reply the ridiculous allegations made by the
representative of the Syrian regime. I refute them in
their entirety. Turkey has a well-established record on
compliance with the weapons-of-mass- destruction
non-proliferation regime. The use of chemical weapons
is a violation of international law, Security Council
resolutions and the Chemical Weapons Convention. It
constitutes a crime against humanity. Its perpetrators
must be held accountable. And the Syrian regime
cannot and will not be held exempt from that.
