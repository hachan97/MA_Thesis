Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We would once again like to thank the
delegations that have expressed their condolences
on the death of the Permanent Representative of the
Russian Federation, Mr. Vitaly Ivanovich Churkin.
Their support at this difficult time is very important
to us.

With regard to today's meeting, we had hoped
that in the light of the concept note prepared by the
presidency (S/2017/ 108, annex), we would be able
to work together to come up with complementary
approaches to finding ways of emerging from the crises
in the European region. While the paragraph in the note
on the unpreparedness of the parties to conflict to meet
their obligations under existing agreements ascribed
them to a lack of political will, our position was that
we would hear ideas about how the Security Council
could help them to achieve that. We also hoped that
our joint efforts would enable us to persuade Kyiv as
to the necessity of fulfilling the Minsk agreements, and
many delegations have spoken about that today. The
Ukrainian authorities must understand that the package
of measures is not a dead end but rather a means of
salvation for Ukraine that will enable it to preserve its
sovereignty and territorial integrity. Regrettably, we
are not quite certain that we were able to move forward
in that direction today.
