The President: I thank Mr. Fall for his
clarifications and responses, as well as for his kind
words addressed to President Konare.

There are no other speakers inscribed on my list.
The Security Council has therefore concluded this
stage of consideration of the item on its agenda.

Before adjourning the meeting, I wish to thank all
of the participants in this debate for their important
contributions. The views expressed during this debate
will be reflected in the presidential statement that will
confirm the Security Council meeting this morning.

In addition, I should like to draw the attention of
Council members to the following points. First, the
meeting of experts on the draft presidential statement
on the question discussed this morning is planned for
tomorrow, Wednesday, 19 December. Information
concerning the time and the meeting room will be
faxed to delegations. Secondly, a meeting on the Arria
formula concerning Afghan women is planned for 9.45
tomorrow morning. The Ambassador of Jamaica will
preside. Thirdly, consultations on the report of the
Secretary-General concerning Guinea-Bissau, initially
scheduled for Wednesday, have been deferred because
of information given to the Council only this morning.
A revised programme of work will be provided
tomorrow by the Secretariat.

The meeting rose at 2.40 pm.
