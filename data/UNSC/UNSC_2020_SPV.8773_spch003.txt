The President: I am informed that the General Assembly is now ready to proceed with the voting process. Each delegation has received a ballot paper. Members of the Council should place an "X" in the boxes next to the names of the five candidates for whom they wish to vote. I take it that all the members of the Council have now filled in the ballot paper. I now will read out the name of each member of the Council. Representatives are requested not to leave their seats to cast their ballots until the President has read out the name of the member concerned. The representative of the relevant member will proceed to the ballot box. Once the representative has cast the ballot in the ballot box, he or she will directly return to his or her seat at the Council table.
