The President: I thank the representative of
Brazil for the kind words he addressed to me.

Before calling on the next speaker, I wish on
behalf of the Security Council to convey profound
condolences to Australia on the death of one of its
soldiers on 9 August, to which the representative of
Australia alluded earlier.

The next speaker is the representative of New
Zealand. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table
and to make his statement.
