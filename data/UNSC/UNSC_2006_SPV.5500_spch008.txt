Mr. Oshima (Japan): The Japanese delegation
views the resolution just adopted as a balanced text. Its
adoption represents endorsement by the broad
international community of the efforts by France,
Germany and the United Kingdom (the EU-3) and

other partners to achieve non-proliferation in a vital
region of the world. Japan appreciates the efforts of the
EU-3 to work out the package that was presented to
Iran in early June and to undertake the subsequent
dialogue with the Iranian authorities.

Japan believes that the important issue of non-
proliferation should be resolved through diplomatic
and peaceful means. The adoption of today's resolution
constitutes, in our view, a path of such diplomatic
efforts. Japan sincerely and earnestly hopes and
expects that Iran will take seriously the message from
the Security Council as formulated in the resolution
and respond positively to it within the defined timeline.

Japan - as a country that has traditionally had a
close, friendly, important and wide-ranging
relationship with Iran, and as a country deeply
committed to nuclear non-proliferation and to the non-
proliferation of other weapons of mass destruction and
their means of delivery - has undertaken its own
diplomatic initiative with the Iranian authorities
towards the peaceful resolution of this issue. Japan is
committed to continuing to make its own efforts to
contribute to the resolution of the issue through
continuous dialogue and engagement with Iran.
