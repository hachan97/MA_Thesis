The President (interpretation from Spanish): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Brazil, Canada, Egypt, Japan,
Mozambique and Portugal in which they request to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Simao
(Mozambique) took a place at the Council table;
Mr. Valle (Brazil), Mr. Karsgaard (Canada),
Mr. Awaad (Egypt), Mr. Maruyama (Japan) and
Mr. Catarina (Portugal) took the places reserved for
them at the side of the Council Chamber.

The President (interpretation from Spanish): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

The first speaker is His Excellency Mr. Leonardo
Santos Simao, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and
Cooperation of Mozambique. On behalf of the Security
Council, I welcome him and invite him to make his
statement.
