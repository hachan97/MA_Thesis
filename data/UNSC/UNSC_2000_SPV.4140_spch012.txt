Mr. Duval (Canada) (spoke in French): We would
like to thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General, Mr. Petrov, for his briefing, as well as his
excellent work in the field.

We welcome the successful conclusion of the United
Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT),
which is a proud achievement, and particularly gratifying
at this time in light of the current difficulties we face in
Sierra Leone. While the two missions are, of course, very
different, both in scope and complexity, UNMOT's
contribution to the peace process in Tajikistan does
demonstrate that the United Nations has an important role
to play in helping Member States overcome security
crises that imperil security, so that they may embark on
the path to peace, national reconciliation and democracy.

Canada salutes the valiant efforts of the men and
women of UNMOT for their important work under very
difficult and often dangerous conditions. We pay tribute
to those members who gave their lives in the service of
peace in Tajikistan. We wish to express our sympathy to
the bereaved families. As the Secretary-General noted in
his report earlier this month, their sacrifice must not be
forgotten. A fitting memorial will be the continuation of
the United Nations involvement in Tajikistan to support
national efforts to build a peaceful and stable country,
rooted in respect for human rights, the rule of law,
democracy and good governance.

Canada looks forward to the Secretary-General's
proposal for the post-conflict peace-building office, which
should include a component focusing on the promotion
and protection of human rights. The international
community must remain actively involved in helping
address the range of political, economic, social and
human rights issues affecting the country.

Canada supports the presidential statement.
