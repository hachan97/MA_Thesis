Mr. Mayoral (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish):
Argentina has supported Security Council resolution
1718 (2006) condemning the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea for its proclamation of possession of
nuclear weapons, its withdrawal from the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, launching
ballistic missiles and the recent nuclear test. All of that
endangers international peace and security.

This unanimous, firm and rapid message from the
Security Council, under the presidency of Japan, is a
clear demonstration of the position adopted by the
international community towards the action of the

Government of the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea. My country hopes that this message will be
heard by the authorities in that country and that that
country will return to the six-party talks so that a
solution can be found for all parties involved. We are
confident that that could occur. After all, the attitude of
the Democratic People's Republic affects not only the
countries in the Asia-Pacific region, but the whole
world.

Argentina, which is a member of the Korean
Peninsula Energy Development Organization, joined
that body with a view to maintaining peace and
security in the region.

Finally, we would like to state our interpretation
that documents S/2006/814, S/2006/815 and
S/2006/816, have been circulated only for the specific
purpose of identifying the items, materials, equipment,
goods and technology referred to in operative
paragraph 8 of the resolution we have just adopted. In
other words, they are only for the specific case under
consideration and in no way constitute an attempt by
the Security Council to legislate on the control of dual-
use material and technologies in areas that are covered
by specific treaties.
