As this is the last scheduled meeting of the Council
for the month of April, let me express the sincere
appreciation and thanks of the delegation of Peru to
the members of the Council, especially my colleagues
the Permanent Representatives, the Deputy Permanent
Representatives, the political coordinators and their
respective staff, and to the secretariat of the Council
for all the support they have generously given to us.
It has been a busy month, and one in which we rallied
to consensus on several important issues within our
purview. We could not have done it alone or without the
hard work, support and positive contributions of every
delegation and the representatives of the Secretariat,
as well as all the relevant conference service officers,
interpreters, translators and security staff.

As we end our presidency, I know I speak on behalf
of the Council in wishing the delegation of Poland the
best of luck in the coming month.

The meeting rose at 4.55 pm.
