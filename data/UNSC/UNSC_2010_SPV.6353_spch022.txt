Mr. Corman (Turkey): I would like to
congratulate you, Madam, and the Nigerian Mission on
assuming the presidency of the Council for July. I also
thank the Mexican Mission for the excellent way in
which it conducted the presidency last month.

I would like to welcome His Excellency
Mr. Boris Tadie, President of Serbia, and the Minister
for Foreign Affairs of Kosovo, His Excellency
Mr. Skender Hyseni. I would also like to thank Special
Representative of the Secretary-General Zannier and
General De Kermabon for their briefings.

We condemn the use of violence last week in
northern Kosovo, which caused the death of one person
and left several wounded. We express our condolences
to the family of the deceased and our sympathies to the
wounded. We call on all parties to refrain from making
provocative statements that could further escalate the
violence in the region.

A new era will start with the announcement of the
consultative opinion of the International Court of
Justice, and we hope that the parties will seize this new
opportunity to solve their problems through dialogue.
In this sense, we deem it necessary to prevent violent
actions on the ground that could jeopardize dialogue
among the parties. It is therefore crucial to elucidate
last week's incident and to find the perpetrators. In the
same vein, it is of the utmost importance that the
international police and troops in Kosovo remain
vigilant and continue to monitor the situation carefully
in order to prevent an outbreak of violence.

In conclusion, let me underline that Turkey
attaches great importance to the security and well-
being of all the communities in Kosovo. It is of vital
importance that all individuals in Kosovo feel safe and
secure. Bosniak Mahalla is a multiethnic world that
constitutes a small-scale illustration of ordinary life in
Kosovo. As such, all necessary measures should be
taken for the security of the Bosniaks, Turks, Albanians
and Serbs living there.
