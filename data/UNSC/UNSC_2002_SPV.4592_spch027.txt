The President: I warmly thank the Special
Representative for those further remarks. He has given
us a lot to think about, including that last proposal. In
carrying away our gratitude to him, could he also
convey to the whole team in the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) from the
Security Council our warm admiration for what they
are doing on the ground in difficult circumstances.

There are no further speakers left on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 1.40 pm.
