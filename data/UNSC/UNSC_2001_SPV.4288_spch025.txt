The President: I thank the representative of
Croatia for his kind words addressed to me. One
specific point from his intervention that I would like to
underline relates to the importance of the Council's not
forgetting the so-called frozen conflicts on its agenda.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Namibia. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
