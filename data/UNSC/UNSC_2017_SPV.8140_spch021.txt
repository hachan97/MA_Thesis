Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): In response to what was just said about Russia
being the only supplier of weapons to Ukraine, let me
go into more detail regarding our theory about how
various countries supply Ukraine with lethal weapons.
We have already mentioned that Canada publicly stated
its readiness to license its companies to supply them. As

it recently turned out, some American companies, and
in particular AirTronic USA, which makes handheld
grenade launchers, are already supplying Kiev with
weapons, having been secretly authorized to do so
with the agreement of both the State Department and
the Pentagon, although the official United States line
is that no final decision has been made on that matter.

We would like to suggest to those promoting and
making such decisions to consider their responsibility
for the results. It is entirely obvious that pouring
American and Canadian weapons of war into Ukraine
is pushing the country's leaders, who are already
sabotaging the Minsk agreements, into undertaking
new military ventures. Everyone must understand that
the conflict in Donbas cannot be settled by force, and
the blame for the lives lost will be on those who put
weapons in the killers' hands.
