Mr. Maquieira (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): The
resolution that has just been adopted, with the support
of Chile, contains important provisions concerning the
political process in Iraq, the role of the United Nations,
with specific instructions for the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General and for the
supervision of the Development Fund for Iraq, and
what the Council must do 12 months from now with
regard to implementation.

The resolution lifts the sanctions imposed on
Iraq - a situation not appropriate to the needs of the
Iraqi people - and thus takes an important and
urgently required step towards normalizing the
economy of that country and integrating it into the
international community.

Furthermore, the resolution just adopted
envisages a process for the progressive winding down
of the oil for food programme in an orderly and
equitable manner that is not detrimental to the Iraqi
people. Another important fact is that the resolution
has made it possible to restore the Council's collective
capacity to agree on a process of political, economic
and social reconstruction for Iraq.

For Chile, the text meets the need to safeguard
the country's political sovereignty, its territorial
integrity and its people's control over the natural
resources. In short, the Council has adopted an
important resolution today, based on a strong political
agreement that will be very important in the various
stages of its implementation. It focuses on significantly
improving the conditions of life for the Iraqi people
after decades of suffering.
