Mr. Tafrov (Bulgaria) (spoke in French):
Bulgaria, like other delegations, welcomed the
Ceasefire Agreement signed in Arusha on 3 December
last between the Government of Burundi and the main
armed group, the Forces for the Defence of Democracy
(FDD). That was an extremely positive development.

I should like to commend South Africa and the
Facilitator, Deputy President Zuma, for their tireless
efforts in support of peace in Burundi. Deputy
President Zuma has been extremely persistent and
resolute in his work, and we pay tribute to him for his
efforts.

However, nothing has yet been definitively
achieved, because not all of the people of Burundi have
chosen peace. Achieving a comprehensive ceasefire is
crucial. It is crucial that the National Liberation Forces
(FNL) of Agathon Rwasa rejoin the peace negotiations
and that progress be made in the talks with two other,
smaller groups - J ean-Bosco Ndayikengurukiye's
National Council for the Defence of Democracy-Forces
for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD-FDD) and Alain
Mugarabona's National Liberation Forces (FNL).

I have one question for Deputy President Zuma:
what does he think the chances are that those groups
will end up joining the ceasefire agreement?
