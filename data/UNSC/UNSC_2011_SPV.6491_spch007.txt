Mr. Salam (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): The
Council of the League of Arab States held an
emergency meeting on 22 February to discuss the
situation in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. At the
conclusion of that meeting, the Council denounced the
crimes committed against the peaceful popular protests
and demonstrations taking place in several Libyan
cities and in the capital, Tripoli. It also expressed its
profound condemnation of the acts of violence
committed against civilians, especially the use of
foreign mercenaries, live ammunition, heavy weapons
and other methods against the demonstrators, all of
which are grave violations of human rights and
international humanitarian law.

The Council also called for an immediate halt to
all acts of violence, a resort to national dialogue, a
response to the legitimate demands of the Libyan
people and respect for their rights to demonstrate and
exercise their freedom of expression, so as to prevent
further bloodshed, preserve peace, the territorial
integrity of Libya and civil order and ensure the safety
of Libyan citizens.

When the Libyan authorities did not respond to
that call, Lebanon decided - in line with the Arab
consensus, the African Union statement of 23 February
and the position of the Secretary General of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference - to vote in
favour of this resolution.

On this occasion, as we did at the headquarters of
the League of Arab States, Lebanon would like to
reaffirm the importance of defending Libya's territorial
integrity and the unity of its people. Lebanon proudly
salutes those who were martyred while exercising their
freedom of expression in Libya. We also express our
deep condolences for the hundreds killed and
thousands injured among the Arab Libyan people.
