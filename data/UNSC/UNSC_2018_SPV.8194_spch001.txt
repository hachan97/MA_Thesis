The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them document
8/2018/164, which contains the text ofa draft resolution
submitted by Cote d'Ivoire.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members to
document S/2018/110, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on developments in Guinea-Bissau
and the activities of the United Nations Integrated
Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau.

I now give the floor to those members of the Council
who wish to make a statement before the voting.
