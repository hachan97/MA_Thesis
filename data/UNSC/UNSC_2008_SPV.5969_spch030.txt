Mr. Churkin (Russia) (spoke in Russian): Well,
it is good that Ambassador Wolff said that he is not a
psychologist, if I understand correctly, because the
distinguished Permanent Representative of Georgia,
Ambassador Alasania, thinks that he is a psychologist
and has attended enough meetings of the Security
Council now that he thinks he can provide insightful
assessments of the behaviour of the members of the
Council. But I leave that to his own conscience.
In connection to the reference made to being
comfortable with something, I would like to say the
following. I am fully comfortable in stating the
positions of the Russian Federation in this difficult
situation. I experience great discomfort when I hear
how colleagues are twisting facts and principles and
when some colleagues continually resort to double
standards in interpreting various situations. I am not
going to go into detail here. I think that you all
understand what I am talking about.

Finally, on the subject of feeling comfortable, if
the distinguished Permanent Representative of
22
Georgia, Ambassador Alasania, feels comfortable about
the fact that his leadership has unleashed a bloody
military adventure and plunged his entire people into
such a difficult ordeal, then what is bothering him?
