Mr. De Riviere (France) (spoke in French): I
would first like to welcome the efforts of you and your
delegation, Madam President, in arriving at the adoption
of presidential statement S/PRST/2019/14. France
firmly supports the chemical-weapon non-proliferation

regime and the work of the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in implementing
the Chemical Weapons Convention. We commend the
work of the United Kingdom and today's adoption of
a presidential statement that reminds us of the major
principles on which its intention is based. We trust
that the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons will faithfully discharge is functions.

We call upon each and every one of us to ensure
that all stakeholders and inspectors enjoy unimpeded
and unconditional access to the sites concerned, and
I call on all stakeholders and all the members of the
Security Council to ensure that together we can move
along a path towards the complete chemical weapons
disarmament in Syria.
