Mr. Kitaoka (Japan): I would like to join the
previous speakers in extending a warm welcome to
Minister Kiganahe and expressing my appreciation for
his attendance at this meeting to provide his
Government's view on the recommendations in the
Secretary-General's report on the possible
establishment of two mechanisms to bring about
national reconciliation and justice in Burundi. I also
thank Mr. Zacklin for introducing the report of the
Secretary-General.

We welcome the news that the transitional
process in Burundi is making steady progress, as
shown by the successful holding of the communal
elections, and we applaud the commitment of each and
every Burundian to that process. We also welcome the
statement of Minister Kiganahe on the
recommendations of the Secretary-General, as it
demonstrates the determination of his Government to
eradicate the culture of impunity while promoting
national reconciliation.

We consider some details remain to be sorted out
in the recommendations of the Secretary-General. In
that connection, I would like to put two questions to
Minister Kiganahe.

First, I am fully aware of the urgent need to
establish such mechanisms, but doing so will require
the discussion and approval of the Parliament of
Burundi once the transition is completed. Therefore, I
should be grateful if the Minister could give us his
view on the timing of the establishment of the
mechanisms.

Secondly, according to the report of the
Secretary-General, the legal basis for the establishment
of the special chamber and the laws governing its
operation will be Burundian law, with necessary
modifications. I therefore would like to ask whether the
Minister considers that it would be possible to achieve
broad support for the recommendations among the
people of Burundi and, in particular, the members of
the Parliament and the various political parties.
