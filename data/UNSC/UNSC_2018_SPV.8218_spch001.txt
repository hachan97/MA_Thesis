The President: I would like to warmly welcome
the Ministers and other representatives to the
Security Council Chamber. Their presence here today
underscores the importance of the subject matter under
discussion.

I am also delighted to welcome our briefers: His
Excellency the Secretary-General; His Excellency
Mr. Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the African
Union Commission; and Ms. Fatimata Toure, Director
of Groupe de recherche, d'etude et de formation
femme-action. Mr. Faki Mahamat is joining today's
meeting via video-teleconference from Nouakchott.

Before each Council member is a list of speakers
who have requested to participate in accordance with
rules 37 and 39 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure, as well as the previous practice of the
Council in that regard. We propose that they be invited
to participate in this meeting.

It is so decided.

The Security Councilwill now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2018/184, which contains a letter dated
2 March 2018 from the Permanent Representative of
the Netherlands to the United Nations addressed to the
Secretary-General, transmitting a concept note on the
item under consideration.

Recalling the Security Council's latest note of
the President on its working methods (S/2017/507), I
wish to encourage members of the Council to deliver
their statements in five minutes or less. Note 507 also
encourages briefers to be succinct and to focus on key
issues. Briefers are further encouraged to limit their
initial remarks to 15 minutes or less.

I now give the floor to the Secretary-General, His
Excellency Mr. Antenio Guterres.
