Mr. Assaf (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): At the
outset, I would like to thank Mr. Muburi-Muita,
Special Representative of the Secretary-General, for
his briefing. We welcome his appointment and his
efforts as Head of the United Nations Office to the
African Union.

The relationship between the United Nations and
the African Union has developed a great deal in recent
years, in particular in terms of peacekeeping and
peacebuilding on the African continent. Today there is
an increasing need for greater coordination and mutual
assistance between the United Nations and the African
Union, in particular in managing and deploying
peacekeeping operations in several African countries.
The creation of the United Nations Office to the
African Union both responds to the need for greater
coordination among United Nations offices on the
African continent and promotes partnership between
the African Union and the United Nations, in particular
when it comes to the maintenance of international
peace and security. We see this very clearly in United
Nations peacekeeping operations in Africa, particularly
the hybrid operations such as in Darfur and Somalia.
The creation of the Office will allow the United
Nations to give continuous advice to the African Union
in building long-term capacity. The Office will also
help to coordinate peace and security activities in
Africa and to follow up the activities of the African
Union in the framework of preventive diplomacy in
order to prevent future crises in Africa and find a
solution to conflicts.

Finally, we hope that the African Union and the
United Nations will be able to fulfil their mandates in a
comprehensive way in order to promote such
partnership and cooperation effectively and to promote
peace and security in Africa, in accordance with the
provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United
Nations concerning cooperation with regional
organizations.
