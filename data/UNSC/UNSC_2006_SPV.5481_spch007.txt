The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached among Council members, I wish
to remind all speakers to limit their statements to no
more than five minutes in order to enable the Council
to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with
lengthy statements are strongly urged to circulate the
texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version
when speaking in the Chamber.
