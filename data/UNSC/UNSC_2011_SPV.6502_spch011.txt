Mr. Laher (South Africa): South Africa thanks
the Chair of the Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1737 (2006) for his 90-day report on the
activities of the Committee. We pledge our support for
the Committee's work.

South Africa shares the concerns regarding the
threats posed by the use or threat of use of weapons of
mass destruction. Due to their reach and indiscriminate
nature, those weapons threaten not only individual
countries but also the international community as a
whole.

South Africa has closely followed developments
in Iran's nuclear programme and welcomes the vital
role played by the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) with regard to Iran's implementation of its
Safeguards Agreement and the Agency's continuous
verification of Iran's declared nuclear material.

South Africa remains deeply concerned about
Iran's lack of compliance with the relevant Security
Council resolutions. We note, inter alia, that contrary to
the resolutions of the IAEA Board of Governors and
Security Council, Iran has not suspended its
enrichment-related activities. My delegation urges Iran
to comply with the Council's resolutions and cooperate
with the Agency so as to clarify the remaining
outstanding issues and restore confidence in Iran's
peaceful nuclear programme.

South Africa has repeatedly stated that it would
not want to see any country denied its rights under the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
We have said that the call on Iran to suspend
enrichment activities should not be a goal in itself. We
have also cautioned against actions that could be
undertaken that would minimize the capacity of the
IAEA to perform its verification work in Iran. We take
note of the recent statements of the E3+3, which
emphasize diplomatic dialogue. South Africa strongly
encourages all parties to resume constructive dialogue
in that regard.
