The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Mr. Solana for his important statement. The European
Union's commitment to continue to work with other
regional organizations, as well as the United Nations,
in order to further reflect on these issues is well
known.

I now give the floor to the Secretary General of
the League of Arab States, Mr. Amre Moussa.
