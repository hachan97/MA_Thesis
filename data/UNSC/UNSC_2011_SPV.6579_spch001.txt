The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2011/4l7, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
