Mr. Vilovie (Croatia): First of all, let me join
previous speakers in welcoming and thanking the
Prime Minister of Djibouti for being here with us, as
well as the representative of Eritrea and the
representatives of the African Union and the League of
Arab States.

For some time now, we have been carefully
monitoring the escalation of the incidents between the
two neighbouring countries, and we fully share the
grave concerns expressed by all member States on the
seriousness of the situation. It is even more serious
given the fragile and sensitive situation in the region.
Having said that, we welcome today's debate as
timely. We also value the opportunity to hear from the
parties themselves, as well as from the regional
organizations involved in helping them to de-escalate
tensions. We appreciate their efforts and hope that they
will yield concrete results shortly.

My delegation would like to use this occasion to
renew the call on the parties, in particular Eritrea, to
exercise restraint, to withdraw their forces to the status
quo ante, and to resolve the dispute through dialogue
and peaceful means, including through third-party
mediation. In our opinion, any military option is not
acceptable; we strongly condemn any use of force and
stress the importance of respect for the territorial
integrity of States. In that respect, we welcome the
announced press statement as a timely and welcome
action of the Council.
