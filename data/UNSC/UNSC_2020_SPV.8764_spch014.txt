Mr. De Riviere (France) (spoke in French): We have a monthly meeting on the issue of Syrian chemical weapons with Mrs. Nakamitsu. There is an agreed standard format, which is that Mrs. Nakamitsu briefs us every month. Everyone is very happy with that. It is a little repetitive, but it is the standard format. The At the same time, Mr. President, in your national capacity, you have organized Arria Formula meetings with invitees whom you chose. There was such a meeting again a few days ago, and it took place in accordance with your wishes. My proposal would be that we maintain the agreed format of briefings by Mrs. Nakamitsu. In the event that it is you, in your national capacity and as President of the Security Council, who wishes to change a standard format, let us vote on your proposal. We should therefore vote on the following: "Do you agree that Mr. Bustani should brief the Council?" If not, we can perfectly well listen to Mr. Bustani at an upcoming Arria Formula meeting that you will no doubt organize very soon.
