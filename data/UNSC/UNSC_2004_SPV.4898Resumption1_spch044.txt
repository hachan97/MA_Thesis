The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Mr. Otunno for his comments. He may rest assured that
we shall take very much into account his observations
concerning the Security Council's role on this
important subject.

I now give the floor, under rule 39, to Mr. Daniel
Toole, Director of the Division of Emergency
Programmes of the United Nations Children's Fund, to
respond to comments made.
