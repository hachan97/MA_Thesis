Mr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): Ukraine voted against
draft resolution S/2016/847, proposed by the Russian
Federation, for the following reasons. We simply do
not agree with tactics that aim to divert attention from
the solid and meaningful draft resolution S/2016/846,
which could have affected the situation on the ground
and help put an end to the massacre in Aleppo. The
draft resolution proposed by Russia barely mentions the
devastating developments in Aleppo, which is cynical,
given the gravity of the situation in that symbolic
Syrian city. We also strongly condemn the attempt to
put a draft resolution to the vote that has never been
discussed in the Council.
