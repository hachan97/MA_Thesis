The President (spoke in French): I should like at
the outset to apologize to members of the Council and
to other speakers for being late. As I said during our
consultations, I had to represent the Security Council at
a meeting of the Economic and Social Council, at
which I had to speak. That meeting was late in getting
started, which made me late for our meeting here; I
apologize for that.

If there is no objection, we will suspend the
meeting at 6 pm. and resume it at 3 pm. on Monday.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Japan. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
