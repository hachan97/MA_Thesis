Mr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): At the
outset, allow me to express to you, Sir, my great
satisfaction at seeing you preside over the work of the
Security Council and to extend to Ambassador Said
Ben Mustapha our gratitude and admiration for the way
in which he guided the Council's work last month.

I also wish to thank you for having provided us
with an opportunity to speak on the declaration adopted
six months ago by this organ, meeting at the level of
heads of State and Government, in conjunction with the
Millennium Summit, in a high point for multilateralism
and our Organization.

While it seems to me premature, if not
presumptuous, to engage in a stocktaking, howsoever
partial, of the implementation of that document -
which, in fact, is more of a general policy framework
than a programme of action endowed with a precise
timetable - I wish nevertheless to make two general
comments on the declaration itself before making a few
brief observations limited exclusively to the issue of
peacekeeping in Africa.

I wish thus to note and welcome the fact that the
Council - which, in recent years, has increasingly
ventured into the field of competence of the General
Assembly and the Economic and Social Council in
order to address issues whose connection to peace or
security is often highly tenuous - has decided to
reaffirm that its primary responsibility is the
maintenance of international peace and security and
has emphasized that its job is to ensure the effective
functioning of the collective security system
established by the Charter, which, as we are all aware,
has been sorely tested of late. I wish, however, to add
straight away that this solid reaffirmation has not been
followed up in any tangible way by action, since the
Council's incursions into the areas set aside for other
organs of the United Nations, far from ceasing, are
continuing apace.

In the same way, I can only welcome the fact that
the Council has deemed it timely to reaffirm its
dedication to the principles of the sovereign equality,
national sovereignty, territorial integrity and political
independence of all States, which we cherish all the
more that some seem to wish to call them into question
in the name of an improperly understood globalization
and poorly defined humanitarian interference.

While in the past I may have sometimes heatedly
voiced here the frustration or even the anger of Africa
at the Council's lack of urgency in involving itself in
the settlement of African conflicts, I am now duty-
bound by truth to note that, in recent times, this organ
has been directing ever-greater attention to African
issues. To be sure - and this is due in part not only to
the complexity of certain issues, but also, we must say,
to the hesitations or ulterior motives of certain Council
members - such involvement sometimes comes too
late, as we saw in the case of the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, and is sometimes inappropriate or
insufficiently effective, as in Sierra Leone and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo. In both cases,
however, there has been a visible improvement and
genuine political will.

Having delivered this encomium, I feel that the
Council e which, it can never be stressed enough, is
supposed to act on behalf of the States Members of the
Organization and not of its own members alone -
could, in order to make its actions more effective and
better targeted, rely more heavily on those who are
familiar with the territory and its problems: the African
members of the Council, the countries of the region,
the Organization of African Unity and, of course, the
African or non-African troop-contributing countries.

In this respect, the recent adoption of a
declaration defining modalities of cooperation for the
troop-contributing countries in conflict management
should be duly recognized as an achievement of the
Council. We should also credit the Council with the
establishment of a working group on peacekeeping
operations; the debates that have been held on
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and on
peace-building; and the declarations that sanctioned
them.

While the African leaders have made an effort to
work for the settlement of the conflicts battering the
continent - as witnessed by the accords of Lusaka,
Lome and Algiers - the Council must not consider
itself released from its responsibilities in that field.
Indeed, its role remains vital and its contribution
irreplaceable.

In fact, by contributing to the conclusion of peace
agreements - be it as an observer, as was the case
with the negotiations which led to the Algiers
agreement - the United Nations can, in a more orderly
and effective manner, monitor the respective
implementation of said agreements.

Some of the mistakes made in Sierra Leone could
have, for example, been avoided. But the humiliation
suffered in that country last year served to highlight
other gaps and major shortcomings and ultimately will
have been useful, because the Council now is working
to see that the mandates of the forces are more clearly
defined and that the forces themselves are in a better
position to provide for their own security and, when
possible, that of the civilian populations where they are
deployed.

The searing and unbearable spectacle of Blue
Helmets taken as hostages also triggered a real
awakening regarding the need to strengthen the
credibility and the authority of the Organization, and in
particular of the Council, around which the system of
collective security has been built - a system to which
we attach the greatest of importance, because it
represents for us a bastion against the misuse of force
and the guarantee of the dominance of the rule of law
in relations among nations.

This is, moreover, the reason that we advocate a
Security Council that fully shoulders its
responsibilities, which is vigilant in enforcing respect
for international legality and, above all, for its own
resolutions-as was rightly recalled here by our
Secretary-General-and the scrupulous and faithful
implementation of peace agreements and settlement
plans agreed upon by the parties to a conflict, and in
particular when it has formally endorsed them. We
advocate a Security Council that is always on the side
of the victim and against the aggressor and the
occupier and which holds fast against those who do
respect their international commitments and who
choose, either deliberately or counting on a war of
attrition, a policy of delays and procrastination in order
to perpetuate a fait accompli and shirk their
obligations.

It is also for this reason that we are calling for a
comprehensive reform of the Council, both in terms of
its membership and its methods of work, to endow it
with ever-greater legitimacy, representativity and
effectiveness, given the new challenges resulting from
international transformations and today's realities.

Before concluding, I should like to express my
satisfaction at seeing that some countries which had
been somewhat indifferent to peacekeeping operations
in Africa have participated in the United Nations
Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea. Here I would like to
urge the non-African Powers not to give up on the
problems of Africa, which is facing complex and
numerous challenges with a determination that is
equalled only by its faith in a future which inevitably
will be better, and to provide their support to help it in
that recovery to which it is committed and to treat it as
an equal and respected partner.

Indeed, the initiative launched recently by
Presidents Bouteflika, Mbeki and Obasanjo, designed
to set up a partnership for African renewal, specifically
is based on the firm conviction of those leaders that
Africa must rely first of all on itself to settle any and
all of its problems and that a genuine partnership with
the developed countries based on mutual interests and
shared commitments would make a decisive
contribution to the recovery of Africa.

In conclusion, once again I should like to express
to you, Sir, my gratitude for having made it possible to
hold an open debate on this declaration, which is the
result of the deliberations of the members of the
Council and whose implementation is, by definition, a
long-term undertaking. I hope that, for my part, I have
made a useful contribution to it.
