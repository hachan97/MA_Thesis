Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian delegation welcomes the
unanimous adoption of the resolution on the Western
Sahara, which extends the mandate of the United
Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara
(MINURSO). That mission continues to carry out an
important stabilizing function. In adopting the
resolution, the Council has sent the parties to the
conflict an important signal in favour of achieving
progress in resolving the issue of Western Sahara. My
delegation expects that this consensus resolution will
provide a serious basis to assist Christopher Ross, the
Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General, in his efforts
to re-launch and breathe new life into the Manhasset
negotiating process.

There is a need to ensure that the protracted
pause in the settlement process be overcome as rapidly
possible. In that respect, we attach great importance to
the process of negotiations and view it as the most
important mechanism which will enable the parties to
resolve issues through direct dialogue.

On the whole, the Russian position on Western
Sahara remains unchanged. We advocate the search for
fair, lasting and mutually acceptable solutions to the
3
issue on the basis of existing Security Council
resolutions and in compliance with the principle that
the parties must agree to any mechanism proposed to
resolve this issue.
