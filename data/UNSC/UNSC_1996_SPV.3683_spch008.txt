Mr. Ngo Quang Xuan (Viet Nam) (interpretation from French): First, I should like to congratulate you, Sir,
and to thank you for having convened this meeting, which
our delegation considers very important.

(spoke in English)

With regard to the item under discussion, my
delegation would like to reaffirm that we, as a Member of
the United Nations, have always laid emphasis on the
most fundamental principles of our Organization, that is
to respect the national independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity of all countries, be they large or small,
and to abide by the principles of non-intervention and
non-interference in their internal affairs.

As a non-aligned country and a good friend of Cuba,
Viet Nam supports the foreign policy carried out by the
Cuban Government, which is in accordance with the
principles of respect for peace, friendship, national
independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, non-
intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of
other countries. In this matter, my delegation fully
supports the ongoing efforts made by the international
community, including those of the non-aligned countries,
with a View to maintaining the aforementioned principles.
