Mr. Wang Yingfan (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
wish to thank you, Mr. President, for your generous
appraisal of my work in the Security Council. Indeed,
today will be the last time that I will speak in this
Chamber as the Permanent Representative of China to
the United Nations.

I wish to take this opportunity to express my
heartfelt thanks to all representatives, Permanent
Missions and Secretariat colleagues for their support
and cooperation during my years of service here.

While I am leaving, my colleagues will continue
to work hard and to face new challenges and the higher
expectations of Member States for the United Nations
and the Security Council. It is a pleasure to know that
many new colleagues have come to replace older
members like myself, including the Permanent
Representative of Chile, who has just assumed his post.
Therefore, I trust that all members will achieve even
greater success and I wish them good luck.
