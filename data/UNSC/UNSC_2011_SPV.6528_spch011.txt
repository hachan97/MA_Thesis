Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We thank Mr. Moreno-Ocampo for
presenting his initial considerations about prospects for
an investigation into the situation in Libya and for
briefing us on the work carried out by his Office
pursuant to resolution 1970 (2011). The Council
adopted that resolution unanimously based on its
serious concern at the widespread use of violence
against participants in peaceful demonstrations in
Libya, which led to casualties among the civilian
population.

What the Prosecutor has said today is
encouraging. We have, with deep regret, heard
information about the escalation of violence in Libya.
It is clear that violence can be effectively halted only
by the implementation of the measures called for in
resolution 1973 (2011), namely, an immediate ceasefire
and the necessary efforts for a political settlement.

We are deeply alarmed by the growing number of
civilian casualties and the destruction of civilian
facilities as a result of the actions by opposing Libyan
parties, in particular as a result of the use of
indiscriminate weapons.

Unfortunately, it must be noted that actions by the
NATO-led coalition forces are also resulting in civilian
casualties, as was seen in particular during recent
bombings in Tripoli. We emphasize once again that any
use of force by the coalition in Libya should be carried
out in strict compliance with resolution 1973 (2011).
Any act going beyond the mandate established by that
resolution in any way or any disproportionate use of
force is unacceptable.

We support the efforts by the International
Criminal Court to carry out a fair and impartial
investigation into the actions of all parties to the
conflict in Libya and to bring to justice individuals
involved in possible crimes against humanity and
serious violations of international humanitarian law in
Libya.
