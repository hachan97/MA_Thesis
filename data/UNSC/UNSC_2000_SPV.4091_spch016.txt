The President: I will now call on the representative
of the United Kingdom, after which we will have a very
short suspension so that the Secretary-General and I may
escort President Mandela out of the Chamber. We will then
resume as rapidly as we can. I know that we are all very
sorry that we could not have all the speeches while
President Mandela was here, but that was unavoidable
given the pressures this morning.
