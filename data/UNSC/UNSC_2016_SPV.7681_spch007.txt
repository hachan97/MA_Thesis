The President (spoke in Chinese): I shall now make
a statement in my national capacity.

Thanks to the common efforts of the Government
of cote d'Ivoire and the international community, the
situation in Cote d'Ivoire has remained stable of late.
Comprehensive progress has been achieved in such
areas as political dialogue, national reconciliation,
security sector reform, demobilization and the fight
against impunity. The reconstruction of the country and
economic development have begun on a good footing.
China appreciates the efforts of the Government and
people of Cote d'Ivoire to maintain peace and stability.
We congratulate that country on its achievements and
wish it every success in attaining prosperity and wealth
at an early date.

China welcomes the comprehensive lifting of
sanctions against Cote d'Ivoire by the Security
Council. That is of great significance, as it represents
the international community's due recognition of
cote d'Ivoire's achievements in the peace process and
development. It is an example that the Council can refer
to when dealing with other African hotspot issues. At
present, some African countries are still subject to
Council sanctions. China hopes that these countries and
the international community can engage in common
efforts to push for the speedy relaxation of the situation,
achieve progress in their respective political processes,
and embark as soon as possible down the path towards
stability, development and the comprehensive and
speedy lifting of sanctions.

Sanctions are not an end in themselves. The Council
should keep itself abreast of the progress being made
and, in keeping with developments in the countries
concerned, adjust and eventually lift sanction measures
in a timely manner so as to create conditions that are
conducive to the re-establishment of peace and the
development of economies.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Cote
d'Ivoire.
