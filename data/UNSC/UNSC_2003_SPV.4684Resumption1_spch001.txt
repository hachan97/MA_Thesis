The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter dated
14 January 2003 from the Permanent Observer of
Palestine to the United Nations, which will be issued as
document S/2003/45, and which reads as follows.

"I have the honour to request that, in
accordance with its previous practice, the
Security Council invite the Permanent Observer
of Palestine to the United Nations to participate
in the meeting of the Security Council being held
today, Tuesday, 14 January 2003, on children and
armed conflict."

I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite the Permanent Observer of Palestine to
participate in the debate, in accordance with the
Council's provisional rules of procedure and with
previous practice in this regard.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite the Permanent Observer of Palestine to
take the seat reserved for him at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Greece. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
