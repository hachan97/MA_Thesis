The President: I should like to recall that at its
3507th meeting, on 9 March 1995, the Security Council
adopted resolution 979 (1995), in which it decided that the
election to fill the vacancy in the International Court of
Justice should take place on 21 June 1995 at a meeting of
the Security Council and at a meeting of the General
Assembly at its forty-ninth session.

This morning the Security Council and the General
Assembly will proceed independently with the election, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Statute of the
Court, for the purpose of filling this vacancy. The list of
candidates nominated by national groups and received by
the Secretary-General as of 31 May 1995, the deadline for
receipt of nominations, is contained in document
S/1995/449. Documents S/1995/49O and Add.1 contain the
nominations by national groups received by the Secretary-
General after 31 May 1995. Document S/1995/450 contains
the curricula vitae of the nominated candidates.

The Security Council also has before it a
memorandum by the Secretary-General, contained in
document S/1995/448, describing the present composition
of the Court and setting out the procedure to be followed in
the conduct of the election.

I should like to remind the Council that under
Article 10, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the International
Court of Justice,

"Those candidates who obtain an absolute majority of
votes in the General Assembly and in the Security
Council shall be considered as elected."

The required majority in the Security Council is eight
votes.

Article 15 of the Statute of the Court provides that

"A member of the Court elected to replace a member
whose term of office has not expired shall hold office
for the remainder of his predecessor's term."
Accordingly, the member elected to fill the
remainder of the term left vacant by the death of Judge
Roberto Ago will serve until 5 February 1997.

The voting will be by secret ballot. When we
proceed to the vote, members of the Council will receive
a ballot paper containing the names of the candidates. No
withdrawal will be accepted once the ballot papers have
been distributed. However, it would be possible to
withdraw between ballots. Members of the Council will
be requested to place an "X" next to the name of the
candidate for whom they wish to vote. Votes may be cast
only for a candidate whose name appears on the ballot
paper, and each elector may vote for only one candidate,
otherwise the ballot will be considered invalid. When a
candidate has obtained the required majority, I shall notify
the President of the General Assembly of the name of that
candidate, and I shall request the Council to remain in
session pending the receipt from the President of the
General Assembly of the result of the voting in the
Assembly.

I shall now draw lots to select two delegations to
serve as tellers.

The President: Oman and the Russian Federation
have been drawn. I therefore request each of them to
appoint one member of their respective delegations to
serve as teller.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Al-Harthy
(Oman) and Mr. Karev (Russian Federation) acted
as tellers.


The President: May I take it that the Council is
now ready to proceed with the election to fill the vacancy
caused by the death of Judge Roberto Ago?

It is so decided.


The President: I would ask the Conference Officer
to distribute the ballot papers.

Members of the Council should place an "X" in the
box next to the name of the candidate for whom they
wish to vote.

The President: I take it that all the members of the
Council have now voted and I request the Conference
Officer to collect the ballot papers.
All the ballot papers have been collected. I should like
to remind the Council that, as we agreed during our
consultations, the ballots will not be counted until it has
been verified that the ballot papers in the General Assembly
have been collected. The Council will remain in session
pending the receipt of that information.

The President: I should like to inform the members
of the Council that I have just received from the President
of the General Assembly the following letter:

"I have the honour to inform you that at the
104th plenary meeting of the General Assembly,
held today for the purpose of electing one member
of the International Court of Justice, the following
candidate obtained an absolute majority of the votes
in the General Assembly: Mr. Luigi Ferrari Bravo."

As the Security Council and the General Assembly
have agreed on the same candidate, the distinguished
jurist Mr. Luigi Ferrari Bravo of Italy has been elected a
member of the International Court of Justice for a term of
office expiring on 5 February 1997.

I should like to congratulate him and to wish him
every success in the high office to which he has been
elected. I should also like to thank the tellers for their
assistance.

The Security Council has thus concluded its business
for this meeting.

The meeting rose at 12.55 pm.
