The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the
Executive Director of the World Food Programme for
his timely and very relevant briefing on a problem that
directly affects a very large population.

I wish to remind the members of the Council that
we have a very long list of subjects to address this
afternoon and that we would like to take full advantage
of Mr. Morris' presence. Therefore, I request members
of the Council to limit questions and comments to
strictly necessary ones so that this can be an interactive
information meeting, rather than a meeting of
statements.
