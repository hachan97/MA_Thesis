Mr. Matulay (Slovakia): We are concerned about
the deteriorating situation in Myanmar, including the
massive violations of human rights, which, if not
addressed adequately, might grow into an intra-State
conflict with consequences for the entire region.

We reaffirm our call on the Government of
Myanmar to keep to its promised road map to
democracy, outlined in 2004, leading to a genuine
democratic transition and national reconciliation, as
well as to take concrete and measurable steps to
address other areas of international concern, including
human rights abuses, forced relocation and forced
labour. We strongly support the efforts of the regional
partners in trying to find ways for Myanmar to respond
to the situation, and urge the Government of Myanmar
to give its full cooperation to the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations.

My delegation therefore voted in favour of the
non-punitive draft resolution submitted by the United
States and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland.
