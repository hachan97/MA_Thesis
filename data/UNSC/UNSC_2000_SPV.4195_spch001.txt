Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.

The situation in East Timor

The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document 8/2000/853, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations.

It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
before it. If I hear no objection, I shall now put the
draft resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, China, France,
Jamaica, Malaysia, Mali, Namibia, Netherlands,
Russian Federation, Tunisia, Ukraine, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America


The President (spoke in French): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1319 (2000).

I should like to announce that the Security
Council has also decided to dispatch a mission of the
Council to Indonesia and East Timor to discuss the
implementation of this resolution, and I have written to
the Secretary-General this evening to that effect.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 9.25 p.m.
