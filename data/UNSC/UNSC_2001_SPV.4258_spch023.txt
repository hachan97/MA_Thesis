Mr. Guehenno: First, let me thank the Council
for the warm support extended to the new Special
Representative of the Secretary-General. As I said in
my briefing, the support of the Council is essential to
the success of the Mission and I will convey to Mr.
Hans Haekkerup the kind words that were extended to
him.

I would like to address the two issues that were
raised by Ambassador Gatilov. First, on the work that
would be done in Bern on the institutional framework
for Kosovo, we are not aware of that work and, indeed,
we would welcome any information on it. Secondly,
the report on Racak is not in our hands. We have never
seen it. We have been in contact with the delegation of
the Russian Federation and we have used our good
offices with various institutions to get our hands on it.
We will continue to pursue those efforts.
