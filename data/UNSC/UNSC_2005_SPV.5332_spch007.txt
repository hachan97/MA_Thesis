The President: It is not a question, Ambassador
Motoc, of bearing with you. It is a question of offering
you my thanks and the thanks of the Council for the
work you have done on two Committees, one of which
whose subject matter is intrinsically difficult. The
extent of that is demonstrated by your report.

I now give the floor to Ambassador Ronaldo
Mota Sardenberg, Chairman of the Security Council
Committee established pursuant to resolution 1132
(1997) concerning Sierra Leone.
