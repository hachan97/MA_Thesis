The President: Let me just say a brief word in
my national capacity in thanking Kenzo Oshima. I
would also like to welcome the Angolan Permanent
Representative to the table.

The United Kingdom is very interested in
contributing to improvements in the humanitarian
situation in Angola. We have a team there this week
from our Department for International Development to
help firm up our own ideas with the Government of
Angola of where priority needs for assistance might lie.
But that is against the background of our fully sharing
the need for better or more balanced burden-sharing on
this issue.

I think it is worth just pointing out - this is not a
specious point - that the full value of the
Consolidated Appeal, at $233 million, is the same as
bout three weeks of oil revenues for the Angolan
Government. Angola is not a poor country. It is a
question of coordination of the right resources going
into the right places. It is very good to see the
Government of Angola and the United Nations working
closely together.
We make the same points as others about
internally displaced persons. We are very glad that
Francis Deng has now worked with the Government of
Angola to produce that significant forward step of the
Government's adoption of the guiding principles for
internal displacement. But I hope that the United
Nations will continue to work on the implementation of
those guidelines. I hope that Mr. Oshima can let us
know that that will be going forward.

Similarly, on landmines, is the Government of
Angola going to be working with United Nations
landmine clearance agencies in the programme? Again,
cooperation and sharing of priorities - under the
leadership of the Government of Angola, as
Mr. Oshima has said - is very important.

I resume my functions as President of the
Council. I would like to give the floor back to the
Under-Secretary-General to respond to the comments
and questions made.
