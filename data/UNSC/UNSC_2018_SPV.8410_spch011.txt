Mrs. Cordova Soria (Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish):
We thank Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo
for her briefing.

We express our concern about the events that took
place yesterday in the Sea of Azov. We reiterate that
the military option is in no way not a solution to any
controversy. In that regard, we call on the parties to
create appropriate conditions to avoid the escalation of
tensions, refrain from action that encourage violence,
comply with the purposes and principles of the Charter
of the United Nations, and respect international law and
international maritime law, including the United Nations
Convention on the Law ofthe Sea. In that regard, we call
on the parties to work for a peaceful solution through
dialogue, taking into account the package of measures
for implementing the Minsk agreements, in order to
achieve a balance of interests, without neglecting the
principles of preventive diplomacy and good offices
aimed at identifying a negotiated political solution.

We also stress that both the international community
and the Council must make every effort necessary to
maintain international peace and security, which in
the long term will be beneficial to the region, with the
parties themselves resolving their differences. Finally,
we call on the leaders of both sides to overcome the
divisions of the past, putting peace first for the benefit
of their peoples, and urge the international community
to heed the concerns of all parties, with a neutral and
equitable approach in pursuit of lasting stability.
