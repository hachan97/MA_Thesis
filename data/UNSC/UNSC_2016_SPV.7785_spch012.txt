Mr. Bessho (Japan): Japan supported the French
and Spanish proposal, because among other things,
it demands that all parties immediately end all aerial
bombardments of Aleppo. Those bombardments are
ruthlessly destroying hospitals and killing civilians.
The situation is devastating. It is deeply regrettable that
the Security Council has failed, thus far, to overcome
its differences. All military activities in eastern
Aleppo must be halted immediately, particularly the
indiscriminate attacks which are violating international
humanitarian law.

Today's failure to adopt a draft resolution that would
have improved the humanitarian situation in Aleppo
is yet another unfortunate example of the Security
Council not being able to take effective measures on a
matter of great urgency. That should not be an excuse
for inaction in the crisis in Aleppo. There are pressing
humanitarian needs on the ground. We must undertake
measures to enable immediate medical evacuation as
well as the movement of humanitarian supplies from
western Aleppo. The Council has a responsibility to
take concrete actions to bring about actual changes on
the ground. The Syrian people have already suffered
far too long.
