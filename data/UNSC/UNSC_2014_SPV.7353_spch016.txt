Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): China has
stated its position against the Council's involvement in
the human rights situation in the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea. China has consistently opposed the
politicization of human rights issues and the pressuring
of countries under the pretext of human rights issues.
The Security Council is not the forum to discuss human
rights issues. We oppose the adoption of any outcome
document by the Council on the human right situation
in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

China is a close neighbour of the Korean peninsula.
We will never allow any unrest or war to take place in
the peninsula. At present, the situation in the Korean
peninsula remains complex and sensitive. We hope
that the members of the Council and the relevant
parties will place priority on the overall interests of
denuclearization and the maintenance of peace and
stability on the Korean peninsula, exercise restraint,
make greater efforts conducive to the easing of tensions,
avoid mutual provocation and refrain from any rhetoric
or actions that may lead to an escalation of tensions.

China will continue to work to realize a
denuclearized peninsula, maintain its peace and
stability, and address issues through dialogue and
consultation. This position is clear and firm. China
hopes that the relevant parties will make concerted
efforts to take genuine actions to create the conditions
for the resumption of the Six-Party Talks with a view
to jointly maintaining the overall situation of peace and
stability on the Peninsula
