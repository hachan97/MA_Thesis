The President: I thank the representative of Malaysia
for the kind words he addressed to my delegation and for
his reference to a second wake-up call. For those present in
the Chamber today who were not here on Monday during
the meeting on AIDS, I should like to explain that the
concept of the "month of Africa", is that this week we will
talk about AIDS and refugees - the closely interrelated
problems that touch so many different countries in so many
different ways and cut across national boundaries - and
that next week and the week after we will address the
specific conflicts. Ambassador Hasmy is absolutely correct.
