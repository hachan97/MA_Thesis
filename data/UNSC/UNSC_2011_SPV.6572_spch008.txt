Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China is watching closely the situation in the Middle
East. We commend the United Nations Disengagement
Observer Force (UNDOF) for the very important role it
has played in maintaining regional stability, and we
support the smooth renewal of UNDOF's mandate.

The events in Syria are an internal affair of that
country. It should be left to the parties concerned to
find a proper solution through dialogue and
consultation. The question of Syria and the renewal of
the mandate of UNDOF are two distinct issues and
should not be linked, so as to avoid complicating and
politicizing the renewal of UNDOF's mandate.

At present, the situation in the Middle East is
extremely complex and sensitive. The international
community must work to maintain regional peace and
stability and to facilitate the efforts of the parties
concerned to achieve a comprehensive, just and lasting
peace in the Middle East that is based on the relevant
Security Council resolutions.
