Mr. Araud (France) (spoke in French): Please
excuse me, Mr. President, I do not want to extend the
debate further or get into polemics. I simply want to
make a factual correction on the text of draft resolution
S/2014/348, on which a vote has been taken. Unlike
what our Syrian colleague has just said, the draft
resolution does not exempt foreign mercenary terrorists
from other countries from the jurisdiction of the
International Criminal Court. Paragraph 1 states very
clearly that armed groups are covered. And, concerning
exemptions, paragraph 7 sets covers nationals of a
country that is not party to the Rome Statute but who
are engaged in operations established or authorized by
the Security Council. In other words, if for example,
citizens of a Member State of the Security Council
were to participate in operations on Syrian territory,
the International Criminal Court could prosecute
them. The exemption in paragraph 7 does not protect
terrorists, no matter what they nationality may be.
