Sir Emyr Jones Parry (United Kingdom): The
resolution we have adopted today is a unanimous
response by the Security Council to a request from the
Government of Iraq. The resolution extends for 12
months the Multinational Force mandate on the terms
set out in resolution 1546 (2004), as well as the
arrangements for the Development Fund for Iraq and
the International Advisory and Monitoring Board. As
with resolution 1637 (2005), this resolution comes with
the important assurance that the Iraqi Government may,
at any time, seek a review of the arrangements or the
termination of the Multinational Force in Iraq mandate.

The United Kingdom will continue working in
close partnership with the Iraqi Government both
bilaterally and as a contributor to the Multinational
Force. We will continue to assist in the progressive
06-63159
transfer of security responsibilities to the Iraqi Security
Forces. The Multinational Force has already been able
to hand over two provinces, Al Muthanna and Dhi Qar,
to Iraqi control this past summer. Conditions
permitting, we look forward to notable progress in the
next year.
