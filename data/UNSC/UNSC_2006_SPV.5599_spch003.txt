Ms. Lnj (Denmark): Denmark is pleased to have
been a sponsor of the resolution just adopted,
improving the delisting procedures of all the Security
Council sanctions committees. In our assessment, that
is the best achievable result at this point in time, and
certainly a step in the right direction.

Improving the listing and delisting procedures of
the sanctions committees in general, and of the
Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267
(1999) in particular, has been a priority for Denmark
since we joined the Security Council in 2005. In
October 2005, we put forward a proposal to establish
an independent review mechanism that would consider
individual petitions for delisting from individuals and
entities and make recommendations to the Council. We
believe that this procedure would significantly improve
on the current procedures and hope that the Council
will give the proposal due consideration, including
when Denmark is no longer a member of the Council.

In Denmark's view, improved procedures
strengthen our common fight against terrorism and our
targeted sanctions. Improved procedures make the
sanctions committees more credible and more
effective, thus providing all States with a stronger
06-67095
incentive to engage early and actively in the
implementation of sanctions. We strongly urge the
Security Council to continue its work on ensuring fair
and clear procedures for listing and delisting.
