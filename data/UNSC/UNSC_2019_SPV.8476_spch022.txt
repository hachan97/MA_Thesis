Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I will be very brief
but, as a number of lurid claims were made against my
country, I would like to respond.

First, I have sent you a letter, Mr. President,
in response to allegations made by the Venezuelan
representative, which sets out very clearly British policy
towards his country - very much along the lines of
European Union policy, which we heard about earlier.

Secondly, if theft and plundering of the Venezuelan
people's wealth is occurring, it is because of their own
Government. It is not because of mine.

The meeting rose at 4.20 pm.
