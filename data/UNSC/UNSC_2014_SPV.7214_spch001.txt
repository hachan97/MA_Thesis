The President: In accordance with rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite the
representative of Israel to participate in this meeting.

I propose that the Council invite the Permanent
Observer of the Observer State of Palestine to the United
Nations to participate in this meeting, in accordance
with the provisional rules of procedure and the previous
practice in this regard.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

I welcome the presence of His Excellency Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon, to whom I now give the floor.
