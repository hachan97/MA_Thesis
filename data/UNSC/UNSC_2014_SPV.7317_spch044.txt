The President: Again, I take this opportunity to
thank members for supporting resolution 2185 (2014), I
also thank the briefers, including Assistant Secretary-
General Titov, for their participation in this debate,
which, like the resolution, is the first ever dedicated
to policing issues. We now have a platform for further
work and outcomes.

There are no more names inscribed on the list of
speakers. The Security Council has thus concluded
the present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 1.05 pm.
