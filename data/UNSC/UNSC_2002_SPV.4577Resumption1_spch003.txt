The President: Sir Kieran, you painted quite a
complex and difficult picture in terms of what is
actually going on in Liberia. Given that there will be
presidential elections next year and given the
importance I think we all attach to there being some
kind of dialogue within Liberia to ensure that we move
away from the current instability, what do you think the
Security Council and others in the international
community can do to foster a constructive,
democratically based dialogue in Liberia?
