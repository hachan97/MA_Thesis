Ms. Menendez (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): We
thank Mr. Guehenno and Mr. Vieira de Mello for
today's briefings on the question of grave human rights
violations, which my delegation, like previous
speakers, considers deserving of condemnation. We
hope that the facts will be investigated and that those
who are guilty will be brought to justice. Moreover,
last month's events in Ituri are proof of the enormous
challenges that the peace process still faces in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and of the need for
the parties to the conflict and the international
community to resolve to promote and assist it.

We have two questions to ask. The first is for Mr.
Vieira de Mello. After his visit to the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and the interviews that took
place there, what, in his opinion, are the principal
measures that the future transitional Government will
have to take in order to put an end to the current human
rights situation in the country, which he himself has
described as catastrophic?

Another question: on repeated occasions, we have
confirmed that one of the problems in the eastern part
of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is access to
the most vulnerable populations. I should like to know
whether Mr. Vieira de Mello has any idea as to how we
could improve humanitarian access to the civilian
population, which suffers most harshly from the
consequences of armed conflict.
