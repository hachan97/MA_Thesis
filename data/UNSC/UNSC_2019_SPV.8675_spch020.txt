The President: I will now make a brief statement
in my national capacity as the representative of the
United Kingdom.

I begin by extending our condolences to France
on the helicopter crash in Mali. I wanted to put clearly
on the record our support for the Special Adviser and
for the work of the United Nations Investigative Team
to Promote Accountability for Crimes Committed by
Da'esh/Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (UNITAD).
As the French representative just said, it is vital that the
Council continues to follow this very important issue
closely. I think that we all bear witness to Mr. Kachi's
very sombre and moving briefing today. It is a powerful
reminder of the devastation that Da'esh unleashed.
I thank him for briefing the Council, while offering
him my deepest sympathies and those of the United
Kingdom for his suffering. I do not believe that there
is a more compelling issue question that we have heard
this month of why the Council has important work to do
than the story he told us, for which I thank him.

I would like to add our voice to thanking the
Government of Iraq. Its support continues to be
instrumental to UNITAD's ability to do its work, and
we welcome the steps the Government has taken to
introduce legislation to allow for the prosecution of war
crimes, crimes against humanity and crimes that may
amount to genocide committed by Da'esh.

Returning to UNITAD, I thank Mr. Khan for
getting the Team up and running. It is very good to hear
that it is now fully operational, as well as the impressive
statistics about gender parity along with the vital work
UNITAD is doing on accountability on the ground.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Iraq.
