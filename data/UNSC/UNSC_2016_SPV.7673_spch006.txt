Mr. Danon (Israel): We are saying it all the time.
You should say it in Arabic, not in English. You should
teach it in your schools. You should stop the hatred.
You should stop naming streets after terrorists. Look at
the squares in Ramallah. Look at the streets in Jenin.
You are naming streets after terrorists.
