Mr. Nitzan (Israel): This monthly debate on the
Middle East is no stranger to falsehoods, distortions
and absurdities. I must say that the performance of
the Lebanese representative this morning offered
us all another window into the theatre of the absurd.
While reciting every meeting on the Council's calendar
this month, he conveniently forgot to mention the
consultations scheduled for 31 October on resolution
1559 (2004). That resolution calls for the disarmament
of the terrorist organization Hizbullah - the same
Hizbullah that has assembled more missiles than many
NATO members; that the report of the Secretary-
General on the implementation ofresolution 1559 (2004)
describes as having "the capacities of a regular army"
(S/2012/244, para. 23); and that only last week sent an
Iranian military drone over Israel.

With Iranian funding, training and arms, Hizbullah
has hijacked the Lebanese State and turned it into an
Iranian outpost for terror. Hizbullah is an integral part
of the Government that the Lebanese representative
represents here. Perhaps that explains the Lebanese
decision to omit the consultations on resolution 1559
(2004) from the Council's calendar.
