Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): The
delegation of Egypt wishes to express to you, Sir, and
to the other members of the Security Council its
appreciation for your prompt response to the request of
the Group of Arab States to convene this emergency
meeting to consider the deteriorating situation in the
occupied Palestinian territory, particularly in the Gaza
Strip, resulting from the cruel punitive measures that
Israel insists on imposing on the Palestinian people in
blatant breach of its commitments and obligations
pursuant to international law and international
humanitarian law, especially its commitments as an
occupying Power under the Fourth Geneva Convention
of 1949.

Egypt supports the statement made by the
representative of Saudi Arabia, Chairman of the Arab
Group for this month, and the statements to be made by
the representatives of Cuba on behalf of the Non-
Aligned Movement and Pakistan on behalf of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, all of which
reflect the unanimity of the international condemnation
of Israel's systematic violations of international law
and obligations.

Egypt stresses its legal and political position
against these unlawful and inhumane Israeli measures,
and it calls today upon the Security Council and the
entire international community to take all necessary
measures to end the Israeli policies of closure, siege
and the cutting off of food and fuel supplies, to ensure
respect for the human rights of the Palestinian people
and to enable that people to live a dignified life,
without discrimination between the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip, because the Palestinians in both areas
constitute one people.

We have all witnessed with deep sorrow the
scenes resulting from those Israeli policies and
measures, which contravene all international norms
and all the obligations of the occupying Power. These
include policies of siege and the closure of all crossing
points, resulting in a lack of food and medical supplies;
the cutting off of electricity; the halting of services in
hospitals and bakeries; and the withholding of heating
supplies during harsh weather conditions. These
measures have also affected the water supply and
2
sewage system, posing the threat that diseases and
epidemics will spread.

Moreover, our sorrow increases as we see our
brethren living in the harsh conditions imposed by the
occupying Power and facing repeated attacks by the
occupying Israeli army resulting - over the past two
days alone - in no fewer than 40 Palestinian deaths
and hundreds of casualties.

As part of Egypt's endeavours to deal effectively
with the humanitarian crisis on the ground in the
occupied Palestinian territories, particularly in Gaza,
during a series of contacts with both the Prime Minister
and the Minister of Defence of Israel, President
Mohamed Hosni Mubarak called for the immediate
cessation of those punitive measures and for all
measures necessary to ease the suffering of
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. He
also asked for assurances that Israel would not repeat
such measures, which undermine all international
efforts aimed at establishing a viable independent
Palestinian State, through the negotiation process that
began following the Annapolis Conference. That
process is now in jeopardy due to the deteriorating
humanitarian and economic situation in the occupied
Palestinian territory.

In parallel, Egypt intensified its contacts at the
highest level with the international Quartet, which
should shoulder greater responsibility in addressing the
deteriorating situation in Gaza and in ensuring that
such a situation never occurs again. Egypt also made
contact at the highest level with the Palestinian
leadership in Ramallah and with other influential
international Powers interested in continuing the
Middle East peace process on the basis of international
legitimacy and full respect for all mutual commitments
on the part of both the Palestinian and the Israeli sides,
in accordance with relevant Security Council
resolutions, the principle of land for peace and the
Arab Peace Initiative.

While Egypt fully rejects the launching of rockets
from the Gaza Strip into Israel, we stress the
importance of Israel respecting international law and
its obligations as an occupying Power in accordance
with the Fourth Geneva Convention, primarily its
obligation to respect the human rights of the
Palestinian people. The humanitarian disaster that the
Palestinians are currently experiencing must not be
allowed to fuel the vicious cycle of violence, thus
08-21448
undermining the positive spirit aimed at reaching a
peaceful and just settlement.

The Israeli Government's illegal decision to name
Gaza a "hostile entity" is an additional contravention
of international law and aims at discriminating against
the Palestinian people on an illegal and illegitimate
basis.

Despite the success of Egyptian and other
international endeavours to ensure that electricity is
restored to northern Gaza and to begin partial fuel
deliveries to the Strip, and despite Egypt's ongoing
commitment to provide electricity to the Rafah area of
southern Gaza, the Security Council must still fulfil its
responsibility to lift the siege imposed on the
Palestinian people and to ensure access for
humanitarian assistance through all crossings, as this is
necessary to enable the Palestinian people to return to
normal life, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
It must also prevent Israel from violating the rights of
the Palestinian people through repeated assaults that
kill Palestinians and destroy all hope for peace in the
Middle East. Egypt is looking forward to the Security
Council immediately adopting the measures necessary
to ensure that such violations will not recur.
