Mr. Hmoud (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): At the
outset, I would like to thank His Excellency Mr. Gary
Quinlan for his very comprehensive briefing and for
his efforts and leadership as Chair of the Security
Council Committee established pursuant to resolution
1737 (2006). We would also like to thank the Panel of
Experts for their efforts in preparing the report.

Jordan is pleased with the extension of negotiations
and the new meeting between Iran and the E3+3 in
Geneva yesterday. That confirms a true desire on the
part of all stakeholders to achieve a comprehensive
agreement regarding Iran's nuclear programme.
Nevertheless, we reiterate that the Committee must
carry out its responsibilities in parallel with the efforts
undertaken for a comprehensive agreement, pursuant
to the relevant Security Council resolutions. In that
context, my delegation calls upon the Committee to
continue its investigations regarding violations and to
engage with the Iranian Government so as to obtain
clarifications regarding those violations over the
reporting period.

Moreover, we appreciate the role of the Committee
in assisting States and international institutions in
the implementation of the relevant Security Council
resolutions, namely, by considering requests from
States regarding the provision of technical assistance in
the energy and extractive industries. That allows States
and institutions to implement the relevant Security
Council resolutions.

Regarding the number of States having presented
their reports on measures undertaken to implement the
relevant Security Council resolutions, we encourage
States to present those reports as quickly as possible
and to coordinate with the Panel of Experts. The
success of the work of the Committee depends on
States' presentation of those reports.

Finally, I would like to wish Ambassador Quinlan
every success in his future endeavours. It was our
pleasure to work with him and his team.
