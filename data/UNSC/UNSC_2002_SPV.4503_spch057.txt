Mr. Lancry (Israel) (Spoke in French): I would
like to thank you, Mr. President, for giving me this
renewed opportunity to take the floor. Consideration of
the resolution that has just been adopted prompts us to
make a few brief comments.

The reference to resolution 1397 (2002), in
particular the appeal for an immediate ceasefire and for
the implementation of the Tenet plan and the Mitchell
recommendations, as well as, in this context, in-depth
cooperation with General Zinni, are positive elements,
and we therefore welcome them.

Having said that, I would like to add that
appealing to Israel to withdraw from Ramallah and
other Palestinian cities without an equivalent appeal to
the Palestinian side to put an end to the suicide attacks
and to destroy the terrorist infrastructure misrepresents
the nature of the Israeli operation, which is one of
legitimate self-defence. In so doing, the Security
Council is rewarding the Palestinian terrorists. We
condemn that; we cannot accept it.

Furthermore, the resolution in no way reflects the
spirit and letter of resolution 1373 (2002), because -
only 48 hours after the Easter massacre - there is not
even a hint about the measures that must be taken by
the Palestinian Authority to eradicate the terrorist
networks. We deplore the fact that the issue has been
handled in that manner.

In conclusion, I would like to restate the Israeli
Government's willingness to cooperate with General
Zinni in order to return, as soon as possible, to a
ceasefire and to negotiation.
