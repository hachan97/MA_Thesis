The President: I thank the representative of Ukraine
for his kind words addressed to my delegation and invite
him to resume the seat reserved for him at the side of the
Council chamber.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of the Republic of Korea. I invite him to
take a seat at the Council table.
