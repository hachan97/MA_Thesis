Mrs. Perceval (Argentina) (Spoke in Spanish): I
would like to thank Mr. Feltman for his update on the
difficult situation in Ukraine.

I am wondering, and I would also like to ask the
Council, why we are having this meeting. Going over
the difficult situation and the worsening of the crisis
once again is undoubtedly one reason, although I know
there are clear, decisive reasons behind the initiative of
the United Kingdom to convene this meeting that brings
us all together. I also ask myself another question, not
out of false piety but out of sincerity. It is the question
Pope Francis asked a few days ago when he received
Mr. Yatsenyuk - who has not sped up hatred and
violence - and gave him a pen with which he might
sign a peace.

Are we acting in the Council to help overcome
misunderstandings? I am certain that we are. It is for
that reason that today my country will merely reaffirm
two convictions. That is, that in the dialogue of
constructive diplomacy that was initiated on 17 April
with a view to finding a peaceful and political solution
to this critical situation, Russia, the United States, the
European Union and Ukraine all expressed at Geneva
a willingness to reach an agreement. What we saw as
willingness to agree, the whole world saw as a source
of hope.

Today, however, we must urge the parties to return
to a constructive dialogue. The difficult situation facing
Ukraine cannot be resolved through unilateral actions
of any sort. It is essential that we strictly abide by the
principles of the Charter of the United Nations and not
intervene in matters under the domestic jurisdiction
of States in any way, including military, political and
economic. We have already said that, and we have not
come here to repeat things. We have come to say that
it is understandable that the Council is meeting today.

The other reason we are here is to reject violence
involving two concrete events, namely, the attack
against the Mayor of Kharkiv, in eastern Ukraine, and,
as requested by the Secretary-General, Argentina calls
for the immediate and unconditional release of the
military observers of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe who are being held hostage.

Again we reiterate that the Council meets in order
to promote peace. With a pen in hand and with our good
faith, we stand ready to help Ukraine emerge from this
difficult situation so that it can achieve the peace that
its people deserve.
