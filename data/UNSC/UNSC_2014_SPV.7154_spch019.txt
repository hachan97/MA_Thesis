Mr. Sergeyev (Ukraine): I thank you, Madam
President, for this opportunity to speak before the
Security Council. I thank Council members for
understanding the critical situation in Ukraine and for
their support.

Before getting into the substance of my statement
this evening, I would like start by mentioning that today
Christians worldwide celebrate a great holiday, the day
of the entry of our Lord into Jerusalem, Palm Sunday.
Unfortunately, today the celebration is falling under the
shadow of aggression and bloodshed in Ukraine. On the

eve of the holiday, terrorists coordinated by agents of
the Russian Federation seized control of State buildings
in several cities of the Donetsk region.

Let me quote a statement made today by Ukraine's
acting President Oleksandr Turchynov:

"A particularly dangerous situation has arisen
in the city of Slavyansk, where professionally
trained armed troops wearing Russian armed
forces camouflage without insignia shattered the
peace. This morning, a convoy of law enforcement
officers who sought to protect the citizens of
Slavyansk were attacked with assault rifles. The
criminals opened intense fire using local people as
human shields. The blood of Ukrainians has been
shed for one undivided sovereign Ukraine. That
blood has been shed in a war that Russia is waging
against Ukraine. The aggressor has not stopped,
and continues to organize unrest in the eastern
regions of our country. It is not a war between
Ukrainians. The situation of confrontation was
artificially created with the aim of weakening and
destroying Ukraine itself."

Within a short period of time, approximately one
and half months, the Ukrainian Government has done
everything possible to avoid confrontation through an
inclusive approach to each and every region. Recently,
Mr. Yatsenyuk, the Prime Minister of Ukraine, visited
the southern and eastern regions - Donetsk, Lugansk,
Kharkiv, Dnepropetrovsk, Odessa * addressing such
issues of concern as the language policy and prospects
for decentralization of power and constitutional
reforms. The Government is ready to consider the
significant empowerment of local authorities in
Ukraine. Unfortunately, the efforts of the Government
of Ukraine have been severely challenged by recent
developments in the eastern regions.

According to Ukrainian intelligence data, during
the past month and a half in the eastern regions
of Ukraine, agents of the Russian special services
embarked on large-scale operations to seize power
and destabilize the situation, threatening the lives of
citizens of Ukraine, for the purpose of separating those
regions from our country. During the past month, our
Mission has regularly informed the Security Council
and all States Members of the United Nations on the
latest developments in Russian actions in Crimea and
other regions of Ukraine. Russia has not only been
constantly increasing the number of its troops deployed
along the Ukrainian border but it has also been sending
subversive groups into Ukrainian regions in order to
destabilize the situation. Such specially designated
groups, made up of 10 to 20 members of the special
forces, primarily from the main intelligence directorate
or general staff of the armed forces of the Russian
Federation, infiltrated Ukrainian territory with the
task of forming and organizing military combat units.
Ukraine has strong evidence of the involvement of the
Russian special service forces, as was mentioned in a
statement the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine
made public early today.
The detention of Russian citizen members of
subversive groups coordinated by the Russian federal
security services and military intelligence is carried
out on a daily basis by the security services of Ukraine,
yielding the following facts, which are just a few out of
dozens.

On 8 April, Russian citizen Maria Koleda, who
fulfilled intelligence service tasks to destabilize in
eastern Ukraine, was detained in Herson.

The Russian saboteur who was about to seize such
strategic facilities as the Kakhovka hydroelectric power
plant was detained in the region of Herson.

On 10 March, a representative of the Russian
Federation military intelligence service was detained
in Donetsk.

On 12 March, the intelligence group of the Russian
armed forces that infiltrated the Herson territory from
Crimea was detained at the control point.

On 20 March, a Russian citizen named Markhov,
an officer of the main intelligence directorate of the
general staff of Russian Federation armed forces, was
detained in Chernigiv.

On the same day, a Russian citizen named Oleg
Bakhtiar, one of the leaders of the Eurasian Youth Union
of Russia, was detained in Kyiv as he was preparing a
group of people under the guise of civil activities for
the criminal seizure of the Verkhovna Rada and the
Cabinet of Ministers.

All of the arrestees confirmed being part of a
network of persons conducting Russian subversive
activities in Ukraine.

Intercepted radio communications of the
aforementioned groups, and others, with their Russian
coordinators are available and provide other clear
evidence.

It has also been observed that such terrorist groups
are heavily armed with weapons used exclusively by
Russian armed forces, namely, the Kalashnikov assault
rifle AK-lOO series. Those weapons have also been
seen in the hands of Russian troops in Crimea.

It is clear that the tactics used by terrorists to
capture admininstrative buildings in the regions of
Donetsk, Lugansk and Kharkiv are identical to those
used to seize the buildings of the Crimean Parliament
and other Governmental building in Crimea, which
video evidence confirms. Terrorist groups are acting
in a very organized and pre-planned manner. One of
the goals is to equip as many locally recruited marginal
people as possible with arms and ammunition. That is
why the primary targets of terrorists have been local
offices of police and security services with weapon
storage facilities. As a result, several hundred guns and
automatic rifles have been seized are now in the hands
of terrorists.

There is substantial video evidence of armed attacks
using gunfire on local Ukrainian police stations, in
Slavyansk and Kramatorsk in particular. Those videos,
which have been widely broadcast on international
television channels and over the Internet, have left
absolutely no doubt that the terrorist groups are not the
peaceful protesters that our Russian colleagues claim
them to be. Rather, they are professional special forces
appropriately equipped and armed by the Russian
Federation.

Terrorists have started using their weapons against
Ukrainian law enforcement and military officers. This
morning in Slavyansk the auto convoy of the Ukrainian
military was attacked by gunmen using automatic
weapons. Terrorists shot and killed Captain Gennady
Belichenko of the Ukrainian security services, while
"Alfa" Commander Kuznietsov and Colonel Kuksa

were seriously wounded, as was a police officer named
Selikhov.

In the light of the aforementioned facts, the
National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine,
pursuant to our anti-terrorism law of 2003, has adopted
a decision to launch a large-scale counter-terrorist
operation involving the special units of the Ukrainian
armed forces. We are not going to let the Crimea
scenario be repeated in eastern Ukraine. We have not
imposed a state of emergency as is required by the
provisions of the Constitution of Ukraine. Instead, we
have prepared a counterinsurgency plan to strike at the
armed terrorists.

In his statement today, acting President Oleksandr
Turchynov said,

"I would like to emphasize that those not involved
in shooting at Ukrainian law enforcement officers
and who surrender their weapons and leave seized
administrative buildings will not be subject to
prosecution."

Only a few weeks have passed since part of the
territory of Ukraine was annexed by the Russian
Federation. And now Russia is applying the same
tools - inciting separatists by waging unprecedented
anti-Ukrainian propaganda in the mass media,
distorting the truth about Ukraine, sending in special
troops to seize administrative and law-enforcement
buildings with the aim of destabilizing the situation
in the eastern regions of Ukraine, and encouraging
marginal groups to pursue their separatist ambitions,
threatening my country's unity and territorial integrity.
Apparently, through these attempts, they hope to
disrupt the presidential elections in Ukraine scheduled
for 25 May.

Russia often positions itself as a prominent fighter
against international terrorism, but by sending its special
agents to Ukraine to effect diversions and sabotage, it
is actually sponsoring terrorism. Russia's statements
and position are in fact supporting the terrorists in
Ukraine who have seized administrative buildings,
taken over the military arsenals of the Ukrainian secret
services and police in several cities and opened fire on
Ukrainian police. Today, official Russian TV channels
have widely broadcast interviews with the three
individuals - former President Yanukovych, former
Prosecutor General Pshonka and former Minister of
the Interior Zakharchenko - who are suspected mass
murderers in Ukraine. They are wanted internationally.
Ukraine has repeatedly asked its Russian partners to
extradite those suspects and provide the necessary
assistance for their investigation. Unfortunately, the
Russian Federation has refused to do that.

Ukraine is being subjected to a large-scale terrorist
operation orchestrated by the Russian Federation in
subregions of the eastern part of the country. That
constitutes a serious threat not only to the security of
the people of Ukraine but to international peace and
stability as a whole. We consider it to be the Security
Council's duty to find a proper and peaceful solution
to this crisis. We once again call on our Russian
partners to put an immediate halt to the actions aimed
at undermining the sovereignty and territorial integrity
of Ukraine. We demand that they leave us in peace.

As Ambassador Araud said, this is truly a final cry
of warning.
