Mr. Mahbubani (Singapore): I will not hold up
the proceedings any more, but there is a reason for my
intervention. I think I owe an explanation to members
of the Council for holding up the proceedings.

From time to time, several of us have met
privately and have indeed expressed concern about the
way these speakers' lists are prepared; that this is not
done in a transparent fashion; and that there is no level
playing field for all members of the Council when it
comes to speaking before the Council. It is unfortunate
that it had to surface in the way it did. I really do not
mean to disrupt the proceedings, but I hope that this
will be a useful signal to all members of the Council to
ensure that, henceforth, when it comes to preparation
of the speakers' list, it will be done in an open,
transparent fashion, with a level playing field for all of
us.

I hope that is not an unreasonable request to
make. The only reason why I have raised it today is
because, before the meeting, I checked with several
members of the Council and they all have exactly the
same understanding that I had yesterday, which is that
there would be no speakers' list. So in the process of
the last 24 hours a change has been made without
consulting the members of the Council. I think that is
not quite appropriate. That is the only reason why I
have raised the issue.

I apologize to all members of the Council for
raising the issue the way I did, but I think it is an
important issue that all of us should be aware of,
namely, that there is a problem that needs to be solved
in due course. Again, my apologies.
