Mr. Aldahhak (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): My delegation rejects the statement made by the
representative of Qatar in his national capacity, as well
as the unfounded lies contained therein. My delegation
affirms that Qatar is one of the countries to have
caused the suffering of civilians in Syria through its
Government's support for the armed terrorists through
funds, weapons and communications. It has prevented
the crisis from being settled through a dialogue that
would have enabled Syrians to decide their own future.
The practices of the Government of Qatar completely
contradict its stated intentions and commitment to the
Syrian people.
