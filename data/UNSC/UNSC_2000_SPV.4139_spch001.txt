The President (spoke in Chinese): I should like to
inform the Council that l have received letters from the
representatives of Algeria, Djibouti, India, Japan, Jordan,
Mozambique, Norway, Pakistan, Portugal and Sierra Leone,
in which they request to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives to
participate in the discussion without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Kamara (Sierra Leone) took a seat at the Council table; Mr. Baali
(Algeria), Mr. Olhaye (Djibouti), Mr. Sharma (India),
Mr. Satoh (Japan), Prince Zeid Bin Ra'ad (Jordan),
Mr. Gouveia (Mozambique), Mr. Brattskar (Norway),
Mr. Ahmad (Pakistan) and Mr. Monteiro (Portugal)
took the seats reserved for them at the side of the
Council Chamber.

The President (spoke in Chinese): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

First of all, let me welcome the Secretary-General,
who has joined us for our discussion on the situation in
Sierra Leone.

The Security Council is meeting in response to the
requests contained in the letter dated 10 May 2000 from
the Charge d'affaires ad interim of the Permanent Mission
of Eritrea, and in the letters dated 11 May 2000 from the
Charges d'affaires ad interim of Mali and Namibia,
documents S/2000/408, S/2000/409 and S/2000/410,
respectively.

I would like to emphasize the urgency and
importance of the matter before the Council. Since the
deterioration of the situation in Sierra Leone, the Security
Council has heard regular briefings from the Secretariat
and had a number of very useful consultations.

I call on the Secretary-General.
