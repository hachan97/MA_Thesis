Mr. Llorentty Soliz (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): I will be very brief and limit myself
to reading out what it says in the special declaration on
the question of the Malvinas Islands, signed by all the
Heads of State and Government of Latin America and
the Caribbean. The Heads of State and Government:

"Reiterate their strongest support for the
legitimate rights of the Argentine Republic in
the sovereignty dispute over the Malvinas, South
Georgias and South Sandwich Islands and the
surrounding maritime areas and the permanent
interest of the countries of the region in the
Governments of the Argentine Republic and of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland resuming negotiations in order to find - as
soon as possible - a peaceful and definitive solution
to such dispute, pursuant to the relevant resolutions
of the United Nations ...".

That would include in particular General Assembly
resolution 2065 (XX).
