Ms. Menendez (Spain)(spoke in Spanish): I
should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your
assumption of the presidency of the Council. I should
also like to congratulate France for its work last month.
We are grateful to Mr. Guehenno for his briefing
and to you, Sir, for your briefing on the outcome of the
Berlin conference.

Spain fully supports the statement to be made
later by Ambassador Ryan on behalf of the European
Union.

The conference that was held last week in Berlin
helped us to assess the many achievements made since
the Bonn conference and to prepare, together, for the
major challenges ahead for Afghanistan. These include
the holding of presidential and legislative elections
next September; making the entire country secure by
ending terrorism, factionalism in the provinces and the
acts of violent opposition groups; ensuring the
development and completion of the disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration process; combating
drug production and trafficking; the development of the
rule of law and of human rights; the reconstruction and
rehabilitation of the country; and the strengthening of
cooperation with neighbouring States.

Spain is prepared to cooperate and to fulfil its
commitments within the European Union and the
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). In this
regard, Spain will soon be approximately doubling its
contribution to ISAF through Euro Corps.

Finally, I wish to associate myself with previous
speakers to indicate that we support the statement the
President will be reading at the conclusion of this
meeting.
