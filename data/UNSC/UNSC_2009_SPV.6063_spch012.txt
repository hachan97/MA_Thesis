Mr. Yakovenko (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation supported the
adoption of the present resolution, guided by Russia's
fundamental position in favour of an immediate end,
by all parties, to hostilities and a resumption of full-
fledged diplomatic processes aimed at finding a
comprehensive and lasting solution to the many
problems regarding Gaza. We welcome the fact that, as
a result of collective efforts by members of the
Security Council and Arab delegations, we have been
6
able to adopt a balanced and, we hope, effective
solution.

We continue to believe that the situation in and
around Gaza cannot be resolved by the use of force or
hostilities in the region - which can only exacerbate a
situation which is already unbearable for civilians in
the Gaza Strip. The fact that all members of the
Council have come out in favour of a durable ceasefire
in Gaza does not mean that our work is done. It is
important to support efforts by various parties,
including Russia, aimed at overcoming the crisis in and
around Gaza.

In conclusion, I reaffirm that developments in
recent hours have underscored the need for an
immediate response by Security Council members to
the crisis in the region. We strongly urge the parties to
heed the views expressed by the Security Council.
