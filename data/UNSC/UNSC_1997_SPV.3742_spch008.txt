Mr. Park (Republic of Korea): On behalf of the
Republic of Korea, the Korean delegation also expresses its
profound condolences to the Government and the people of
China on the passing away of their Paramount Leader,
Mr. Deng Xiaoping. Mr. Deng left an indelible mark on the
history of mankind, as he did so much to improve the well-
being of so many people in such a short period of time. In
that way he made an indispensable contribution to the peace
and prosperity not only of China but also of the entire East
Asian region and beyond.

We are convinced that the policies of openness and
reform which he initiated set China on the path to
prosperity. It is our sincere hope that the Chinese people
and leadership will be able to overcome the sorrow and
grief that engulf them at the loss of their great leader, and
will continue to march forward on the road that Mr. Deng
Xiaoping pioneered.
