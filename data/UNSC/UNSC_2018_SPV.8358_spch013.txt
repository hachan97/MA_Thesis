Ms. Guadey (Ethiopia): We thank the Special
Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process,
Mr. Nickolay Mladenov, for his briefing on the latest
developments with regard to the situation in the Middle
East, including the Palestinian question.

We remain concerned that negative actions taken
by the parties continue to stoke tensions in the region,
and we are saddened by the deaths of innocent civilians.
It is absolutely vital that the parties refrain from actions
that do not contribute to making progress, but instead
increase frustration and mistrust.

The security and humanitarian situation in Gaza
continues to be a source of concern, and making every
possible effort to avoid the worst is still a matter of
priority. We hope that some of the events planned
during the high-level week will help to mobilize the
necessary international assistance to meet the needs of
the Palestinians. We continue to support United Nations
engagement, in close coordination with Egypt and all
concerned parties, to address the situation in Gaza.
Progress in the Egyptian-led reconciliation process is
key, and the parties must be urged to cooperate for the
sake of their own people, who have been suffering for
far too long.
Finally, 25 years after the signing of the Oslo
Accords, peace in the Middle East and Palestine
continues to elude us. The need to reinvigorate efforts
aimed at achieving a comprehensive, lasting and just
solution on the basis of the two-State formula is very
clear. In that regard, facilitating the resumption of direct
negotiations between the parties is vital. It is incumbent
upon the Council to support such efforts for the sake
of peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians and
peace in the broader Middle Eastern region.
