Mr. De Rivero (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I
would like to thank Assistant Secretary-General Angela
Kane for the valuable information she shared with us.

My delegation regrets the escalation of armed
violence between Israel and the Hamas-led
Government of the Palestinian Authority. We condemn
the unnecessary and provocative military operation, for
which Hamas was responsible: the attack, through a
tunnel, on an Israeli military post, in which two
members of the Israeli armed forces were killed and a
third abducted. We call for the immediate and
unconditional freeing of the Israeli soldier. We also
condemn the kidnapping and killing of another Israeli
citizen in the West Bank and the constant firing of
Qassam rockets.

At the same time, we call upon Israel to cease its
attacks in Gaza, in particular against infrastructure
such as power stations. Such attacks jeopardize water
and food supplies and could cause a critical
humanitarian situation, as Mr. Jan Egeland, Under-
Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, recently
stated. Similarly, my delegation agrees with what the
Group of Eight, meeting in Moscow, has said.
Additionally, we express our concern about the
detention of elected officials of the Palestinian
Authority.

We agree that it is urgent for the Quartet, at the
highest level, to act resolutely to bring about a
permanent ceasefire and to ensure that the kidnapped
Israeli soldier is returned and that detained Palestinian
Authority officials are freed. We call upon both sides to
end the violence, but we insist that Hamas accept the
call by the Quartet and the Security Council that it
recognize Israel, end acts of violence and abide by
obligations previously undertaken by the Palestinian
Authority.
