Mr. Suescum (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): First
of all, we would like to welcome and to thank Minister
Nqakula for his detailed briefing and to convey to him
our delegation's gratitude for the carrying out of his
duties as Facilitator of the Burundi Peace Process. In
turn, we would also like to commend the efforts
undertaken by the African Union, the Regional Peace
Initiative on Burundi and the United Nations Integrated
Office in Burundi, as well as the work undertaken in
that country by the Peacebuilding Commission, in
order to obtain peace and sustainable development
there.

Like previous delegations who have taken the
floor, we welcome the establishment of the new
National Unity Government and encourage the new
members of the cabinet to set aside their political
differences and to work together for common
objectives, such as national reconciliation,
development and stability in Burundi.

We note that the deadlock in the peace
negotiations, in particular the intransigence
demonstrated by certain members of the
PALIPEHUTU-FNL and their refusal to join the
negotiations, represents one of the greatest obstacles to
peacebuilding in the country and in that context we call
upon the PALIPEHUTU-FNL to join without delay and

without preconditions, the Joint Verification and
Monitoring Mechanism in order to arrive at a political
solution and thus ensure the rapid implementation of
the Comprehensive Ceasefire Agreement.

For its part, the Government of Burundi must also
double its efforts to facilitate the disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration processes, as well as
its efforts to reform the security sector.

Allow me to emphasize that for Panama, peace
and justice are two sides of the same coin. In that
context we call upon the Government of Burundi and
the United Nations to continue negotiations in order to
define relations between a truth and reconciliation
commission and a special tribunal, which will ensure
that perpetrators of international human rights violations
and crimes against humanity will be brought to justice,
making it clear that human rights are not negotiable.

Finally, Panama supports the draft press
statement as has been presented to us.
