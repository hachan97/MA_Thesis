Mr. Tiendrebeogo (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French): Burkina Faso is deeply concerned at the
escalation of violence in South Ossetia, which has
already claimed numerous victims. We urgently appeal
to the parties to observe an immediate cessation of
hostilities. We urge them to favour dialogue in order to
reach a negotiated settlement of their dispute, and we
encourage the mediation efforts that are under way.
