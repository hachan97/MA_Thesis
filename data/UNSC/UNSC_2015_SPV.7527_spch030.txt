The President (spoke in Russian): I wish to remind
all speakers to limit their statements to no more than
four minutes in order to enable the Council to carry
out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy
statements are kindly requested to circulate their texts
in writing and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking in the Chamber. I also ask that speakers
deliver their statements at a reasonable speed so that
accurate interpretation can be provided.

I wish to inform all concerned that we will be
continuing the open debate through the lunch hour, as
we have a large number of speakers.

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Ibrahim
Al-Jaafari, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic
of Iraq.
