The President (spoke in Arabic): There are no

more names inscribed on the list of speakers.

I should like to thank the members of the Security
Council, as well as non-members and our briefers
today, whose contributions afforded us a more in-depth
look at peacekeeping operations in order to make them
more effective and ensure that they are able to draw
on all the tools available to us in the United Nations to
bring about sustained peace. We will continue ourjoint
efforts with other Council members and countries to
achieve that goal.

The meeting rose at 4.30 pm.
