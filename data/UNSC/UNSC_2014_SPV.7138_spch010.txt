Mr. Errazuriz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): The
delegation of Chile voted in favour of the draft
resolution (S/2014/189) because we believe that it is
the appropriate response of the Council to the current
crisis in Ukraine. Given that situation, at stake here are
fundamental principles of international law, such as
abstaining from the threat or use of force and respecting
the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity
of Ukraine, in accordance with the Charter of the
United Nations.

For its part, the Budapest Memorandum requires
that the signatory parties observe the independence,
sovereignty and current borders of Ukraine and refrain
from the threat or use of force against the territorial
integrity or political independence of Ukraine.

The holding of a referendum on the status of Crimea
is inconsistent with the Constitution of Ukraine, a
unified State of which Crimea is an integral part. It is
therefore fundamental that the rule of law be observed
in Ukraine nationally and internationally.

It is for the people of Ukraine alone to determine
their future in a democratic and inclusive process that
guarantees the rule of law, human rights, fundamental
freedoms and respect for the rights of minorities. The
crisis must be resolved peacefully and through dialogue,
in accordance with the norms of international law.

Chile regrets that the United Nations organ that
has the primary responsibility for the maintainance of
international peace and security has not been able to
adopt a draft resolution. Today, owing to the use of the
veto, the Council has not fulfilled its obligation.
