Ms. Murmokaite (Lithuania): We note the request
by the Russian Federation. I am also very well aware
of certain labels that my delegations has been given.
In spite of that fact, since those labels have been
repeated on various occasions - "killer amendments"
and things of the kind - we appreciate the drafting of
the statement referred to by the representative of the
Russian Federation. However, we would like to have a
little bit more time to look into the text seriously.

In our opinion, some of aspects are not reflected
in that text. For one, we are very well aware of the
information that separatists have been preventing the
provision of humanitarian assistance to the population.
Humanitarian assistance has been offered by the
Government of Ukraine. A call to the separatists not
to prevent the delivery of humanitarian assistance is
something that we should like to see in the text, as well
as some other amendments that we might come up with.
