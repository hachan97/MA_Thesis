The President: May I take it that the draft report,
as corrected, is adopted by the Council?

There being no objection, it is so decided.

This decision will be reflected in a note by the
President of the Security Council, to be issued as
document S/2000/839.

The Security Council has thus concluded its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 2.20 p.m.
