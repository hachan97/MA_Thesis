Mr. Duclos (France) (spoke in French): Allow
me also to welcome Ambassador Bolton, the new
Permanent Representative of the United States of
America. I assure him of my delegation's readiness to
cooperate closely with him, as it is our custom to do
with the United States Mission.

France has fully supported the resolution just
adopted. We resolutely condemn the terrorist attacks
being committed in Iraq on an almost daily basis. The
Security Council is playing its role by reacting to those
unjustifiable acts that threaten peace and security. In
Iraq as well as elsewhere, the fight against terrorism
must be carried out relentlessly and with the most
absolute determination.

France would also like to reiterate its belief that
only a political solution pursuant to resolution 1546
(2004) is likely to provide Iraq with prospects for
peace and stability. That political solution must be
based on national reconciliation, the rejection of all
forms of exclusion and discrimination and the
involvement of all Iraqis in the transition.

In that regard, it is essential that the draft
constitution to be submitted to a vote in the
Transitional National Assembly and subsequently to
popular referendum first be the subject of consensus
among all segments of the Iraqi population within the
Constitutional Drafting Commission.

France reaffirms its full support for the political
process in Iraq, as well as its determination to help the
Iraqi people during this difficult period of transition.
