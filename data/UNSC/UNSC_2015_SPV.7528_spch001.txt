The President (spoke in Spanish): As this is the
first formal meeting of the Security Council for the
month of October, I should like to take this opportunity
to express my personal thanks and those of the members
of the Council to the outgoing President and the Russian
delegation for the excellent work performed not only by
the Head of the Russian Mission, Ambassador Vitaly
Churkin, but by his entire team, because, in the final
analysis, the Security Council's work is about the
teamwork of the 15 members of this important principal
organ of the United Nations. Furthermore, they did
a very good job in a special month, in which the
presidency of the Council coincided with the opening
of the General Assembly at its seventieth session and
the major task of establishing the development agenda
for the next 15 years.

Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.

with rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure, I invite the representative of Mali to

In accordance with rule 39 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure, I invite Mr. Mongi
Hamdi, Special Representative of the Secretary-General

The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda.
