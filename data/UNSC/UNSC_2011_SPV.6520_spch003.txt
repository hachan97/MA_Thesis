The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Mr. Pascoe for his briefing.

Before I give the floor to delegations wishing to
make statements, I remind all speakers that their
statements should be reasonably brief in the light of the
43 requests for the floor today.

I now give the floor to the Permanent Observer of
Palestine.
