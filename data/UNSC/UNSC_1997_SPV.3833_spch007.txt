Mr. Dahlgren (Sweden): The United Nations has been
closely involved in the negotiations towards peace in
Tajikistan. The United Nations and the international
community should now demonstrate their endurance as well
as their support for the next crucial phase of consolidating
peace in that country. The Government of Sweden therefore
supports an expanded mandate for the United Nations
Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) as well as an
increase in the size of the Mission.

We welcome the integrated approach taken by the
Secretary-General in recommending enlarged
responsibilities for the United Nations in Tajikistan. In
assisting the parties to implement the inter-Tajik
agreements, the United Nations will be making a broad
contribution ranging from the political and military fields to
the coordination of international humanitarian assistance
and the reintegration of refugees. This, we feel, is a good
example of how the joint capacity of the whole United
Nations system can be used to support the peace process
and lay the groundwork for the post-conflict reconstruction
and long-term recovery of war-torn societies.

Implementing peace agreements is rarely a smooth
process. It requires considerable good faith and constant
efforts by the parties. In Tajikistan, progress has been
achieved in a number of areas. Sweden welcomes the fact
that both the Tajik Government and the United Tajik
Opposition appear determined to pursue this process in a
cooperative spirit.

The level of violence, in particular in the central part
of the country, still gives rise to concern. In order for
UNMOT to carry out its mandate, its safety and its ability
to perform its tasks unhindered must be guaranteed. As we
continue to follow closely events in Tajikistan, the safety of
international personnel will continue to require our
particular attention.
