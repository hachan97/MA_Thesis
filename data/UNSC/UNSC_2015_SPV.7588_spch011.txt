The President: I thank Minister Wang Yi
particularly for having travelled all the way to be here
for one day. He is about to catch a plane to rush back.
We are very appreciative of his effort, which, in itself
makes an important statement.

I now give the floor to the Secretary of State for
Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United
Kingdom.
