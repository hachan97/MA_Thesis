The President (interpretation from Chinese): I thank
the representative of Egypt for his kind words addressed to
me.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the Minister
of State for Foreign Affairs and Regional Cooperation of
Uganda, Mr. Amama Mbabazi. I welcome the Minister and
invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make
his statement.
