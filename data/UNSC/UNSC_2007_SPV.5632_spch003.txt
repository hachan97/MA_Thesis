The President: I thank the Secretary-General for
his presence and for his inspiring statement.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers
to limit their statements to no more than five minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with longer statements are
kindly requested to circulate their texts in writing in
the Chamber and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking.

I now give the floor to the President of the
General Assembly, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa.
