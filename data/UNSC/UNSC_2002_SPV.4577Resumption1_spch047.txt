The President: Can I ask if Security Council
members who did not speak this afternoon wish to do
so now, or if anybody has any follow-up comments or
questions before I attempt to sum up this afternoon's
discussion? For the moment, there appear to be none,
so I will now ask the two Foreign Ministers to take the
floor.
