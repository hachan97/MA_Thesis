Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese):
The Chinese delegation voted in favour of the
resolution just adopted. As a friendly neighbour of
Afghanistan's, the Chinese Government attaches great
importance to the situation in that country. The Chinese
Government firmly supports the people and
Government of Afghanistan in their efforts to achieve
peace and stability. We hope that the adoption of
today's resolution will help to promote peace and
stability in Afghanistan.

We would also like to thank the countries
concerned for their efforts in connection with the
resolution.

I would like to take this opportunity to make one
point. We believe that we should spare no effort to
reach consensus and unanimity when we work to adopt
a draft resolution of the Security Council in the future.
The unanimous support of the 15 members of the
Security Council is important for any resolution.

We hope that the manner in which the resolution
was adopted today will not set a precedent. Rather, we
hope that the members of the Council will consult with
one another to endeavour to adopt all draft resolutions
by consensus.
