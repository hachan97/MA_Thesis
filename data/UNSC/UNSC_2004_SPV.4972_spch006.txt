Mr. Cheng Jingye (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China is opposed to Israel's large-scale demolition of
Palestinian houses, a practice that is in violation of
international law. We also condemn the Israeli military
actions that have caused heavy civilian casualties in
Gaza. Those Israeli actions will only aggravate the
already deteriorating situation in the Middle East and
will in no way contribute to a resumption of peace
talks. China urges Israel to immediately halt such
actions and return to the path of a political settlement
of the relevant issues. Based on that position, China
voted in favour of the draft resolution.

In that connection, I should like to appeal once
again to the Israelis and the Palestinians to put an end
to the Vicious circle of violence, to resume contacts and
dialogue as soon as possible and to implement the
relevant obligations under the road map. The
international community should also intensify its
efforts to press for a speedy resumption of the road
map's implementation.

The Government and the people of China have
deep sympathy for the sufferings of the Palestinian
people. We are prepared to work together with the
international community to provide Palestine with
appropriate humanitarian assistance.
