The President: I thank Mrs. Ogata for the
clarifications and answers she has provided.

As this has been Mrs. Ogata's last briefing to the
Council, I should like to conclude by expressing our
collective deep appreciation for all she has done to
safeguard the rights and the well-being of refugees, and
for the way that she has contributed through her work
to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the
United Nations, the maintenance of international peace
and security, the development of friendly relations
among nations and the respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 5.45 p.m.
