Mr. Williamson (United States of America): We
join others in expressing our condolences to
Afghanistan and Pakistan.

I have just two quick questions. The first is for
Ambassador Nishimura. I wonder whether he could
provide some more detailed information on his
estimates for the overall funding requirements for
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration,
including, for example, estimates for vocational
training and other programmes such as he discussed in
his presentation.

My second question is for Ambassador Braun. To
build on the British intervention, can he discuss in
more detail his efforts to recruit police and what
difficulties he is running into. Later I will make
reference to some of the challenges in recruiting
members to be trained for the army.
