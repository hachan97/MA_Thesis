Ms. Chan (Chief, Security Council Secretariat Branch): 1 would like to say a few words, but I promise
not to speak for more than five minutes. After 36 years,
and today at the United Nations, what more can I ask
for? It is definitely time to retire. I am very touched
and thrilled by the sentiments expressed to me this
morning. I wish to thank all here who have given me
this honour. I am very privileged to have had the
opportunity and honour to work for them and for all
those who came before them. From the bottom of my
heart, I thank them all.
