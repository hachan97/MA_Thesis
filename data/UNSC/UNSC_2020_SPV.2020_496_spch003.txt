I refer to our letter of 2 June 2020 calling on the members of the Council to vote on the draft resolution submitted by Germany and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the creation and mandate of the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in the Sudan (UNITAMS), put in blue under the symbol S/2020/485. I would like to present the following explanation of vote. France welcomes the creation of this new political mission, which will enable the United Nations to accompany and support the Sudanese transition in achieving its main objectives: the building of the rule of law, the peace process and the implementation of future peace agreements, the consolidation of peace in Darfur and in the Two Areas and the mobilization of development aid and humanitarian assistance. France encourages the United Nations and the Sudanese authorities to fully implement this mandate, in particular with regard to the promotion and monitoring of human rights, as well as the strengthening of the capacities of the Sudanese security forces through the deployment of United Nations advisers. It is essential, as the Council prepares to take a decision on the withdrawal of the African Union- United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, that the mandate of UNITAMS in these two areas be quickly implemented. Finally, France reiterates its full support for the transitional authorities and welcomes their efforts to build a democratic, inclusive, peaceful and prosperous Sudan. We call on all armed groups to join the peace process unconditionally, and we encourage all parties to continue negotiations in order to build an inclusive and lasting peace in Darfur and the Two Areas.
