The President (spoke in Chinese): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them

armed conflict. Members of the Council also have
before them document 8/2006/267, which contains the
text of a draft resolution prepared in the course of the
Council's prior consultations.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:

Ghana, Greece, Japan, Peru, Qatar, Russian
Federation, Slovakia, United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of

votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1674 (2006).

present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
