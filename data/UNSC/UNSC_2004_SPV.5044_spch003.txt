The President (spoke in Spanish): May I take it
that the draft report, as corrected, is adopted by the
Council?

There being no objection, it is so decided.

This decision will be reflected in a note by the
President of the Security Council, to be issued as
document S/2004/743.

The Security Council has thus concluded its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 10.20 a.m.
