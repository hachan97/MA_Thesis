Ms. Rice (United States of America): The United
States deeply regrets the necessity to vote on this
resolution to end the mandate of the United Nations
Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS). We call on the
Government of the Sudan yet again to reconsider its
demand that UNMIS cease its activities in the Republic
of the Sudan effective 9 July. The Mission has a critical
role to continue to play in regional stability, especially
in the two areas.

The United States is sending a clear message,
along with other Council members, that it wants the
United Nations to remain in the two areas, especially at
this critical juncture. With this resolution, the Council
has made clear that it is ready to authorize continued
United Nations operations in Southern Kordofan and
11-40867
Blue Nile to support new security arrangements, and
we will continue over the coming weeks to urge the
Government of the Sudan to accept this. It is in its
interest to do so. We hope that others in the
international community will continue to encourage
Khartoum to accept this. It is critical that the
Government of the Sudan cooperate fully with UNMIS
as it begins the process of withdrawing.

We continue to be deeply concerned about the
fighting in Southern Kordofan, the displacement of
civilians and the ensuing humanitarian crisis. The
Government of the Sudan and the Sudan People's
Liberation Movement North must return to the
negotiating table in the coming days and agree to an
immediate cessation of hostilities. We also call on the
Government of the Sudan to work actively on
agreements to bring peace and stability to the border
and in Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan states.
