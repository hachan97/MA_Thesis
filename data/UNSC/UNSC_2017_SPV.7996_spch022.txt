Mr. Safronkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I would like to thank my American colleague
Ambassador Haley for her comments. We too propose
that we work together. The point of my statement was
that we can see a meaningful way out ofthe situation on
the Korean peninsula only by combining regional and
international forces. It is clearly stated in the relevant
resolutions that it is not through sanctions alone but,
above all, through political efforts that we can find a
way out. That is the task we have ahead of us. History
has shown us that sanctions are not a panacea. We should
therefore seek a political solution and take the path of
creative diplomacy. And as I said in my statement, we
propose to work collectively to do that.

The meeting rose at 4.20 pm.
