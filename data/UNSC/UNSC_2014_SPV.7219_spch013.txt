Mrs. Perceval (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): I
would like to thank Mr. Jeffrey Feltman for his briefing
on the latest events in Ukraine and for expressing
the constant willingness of the Secretary-General to
contribute to peace and dialogue.

The Government and the people of Argentina
express their profound sadness, pain, solidarity and
deepest condolences to the families of the victims
of yesterday's tragic Malaysia Airlines crash. We
also express our condolences to the people and the
Government of Ukraine and to the Governments and the
peoples of the other countries whose citizens lost their
lives. In particular, we ask that our colleagues among
the Permanent Representatives of the countries whose
citizens were aboard that flight convey our condolences
to the families, especially to those who saw the hopes
for their children's futures extinguished.

The severity of this event clearly demands
action. Like our colleagues, Argentina calls for an
impartial international investigation that objectively
and unequivocally establishes what happened.
Responsibility and the facts must be determined as
soon as possible, and investigators must be granted
immediate, unhindered access.

Although it is not today's topic, I should like to say
that, while there had been encouraging indications that
the crisis in Ukraine was entering a phase of waning
tension, fears that violent confrontation would continue
have not dissipated. But the topic today does involve
calling once again for the armed groups to cease their
violence and demanding that they halt unilateral actions
and their violations and trampling of human rights,
which do nothing but deepen the crisis and worsen the
situation, especially for the civilian population and for
the innocent.

We reiterate the need to safeguard due respect
for Ukraine's conduct of its internal affairs without
interference - whether military, political or
economic 4 in matters under its jurisdiction. Argentina
seeks to promote full respect by everyone for the
principles of international law and human rights law as
enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.

These are sad and difficult times. Argentina
therefore calls for prudence. We will not join in using
the language of geopolitical disputes. We will not join
in a pointless blame game. This is a time for sorrow,
reflection and an urgent search for the truth behind
the incident to determine those responsible. May the
victims rest in peace.
