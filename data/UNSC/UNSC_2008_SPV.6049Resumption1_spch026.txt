Mr. Weissbrod (Israel): I do not want to take up
any more of the Council's precious time. I think we
had a long debate and that most of us shared the
message of hope and progress in the peace process, yet
I must refer to the statement by the representative of
Iran.

Again, his statement demonstrates the challenges
before us posed by radical forces in the region, led by
the Islamic forces of Iran, who consistently try to
obstruct any progress towards peace. I think that every
statement today conveyed a message of hope, but that
made by the representative of Iran was in total
contradiction of that message.
