The President (spoke in French): In accordance
with rule 39 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure, I invite the following briefers to participate
in this meeting: Mr. Herve Ladsous, Under-Secretary-
General for Peacekeeping Operations; Mr. Bruce
Munyambo, Police Commissioner of the United Nations
Mission in the Republic of South Sudan; Ms. Priscilla
Makotose, Police Commissioner of the African
Union/United Nations Hybrid operation in Darfur;
Mr. Georges-Pierre Monchotte, Police Commissioner
of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti;
and Mr. Issoufou Yacouba, Police Commissioner
of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated
Stabilization Mission in Mali.

The Security Councilwill now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda.

The intention is for this meeting to be as interactive
as possible, along the lines of the briefing held last
November (see S/PV.7558) and our dialogues with the
Force Commanders. We look forward to questions from
Council members to the Commissioners and from the
Commissioners to the Council.

I now give the floor to Mr. Ladsous.
