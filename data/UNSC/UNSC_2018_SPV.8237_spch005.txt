Mr. Zambrana Torrelio (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): At the outset, we would
like to thank the Under-Secretary-General and High
Representative for Disarmament Affairs, Ms. Izumi
Nakamitsu, for her briefing, of which we take due note.
Secondly, we welcome the speedy recovery of those
affected by the incident in question.

Bolivia believes that the use of chemical weapons
by any actor in any circumstance is despicable as an act
that undermines international peace and security, and
we therefore reiterate our concern about the challenges
being posed to the non-proliferation regime. Any

use of toxic chemical weapons, agents or products as
weapons is completely reprehensible to humankind and
is contrary to the provisions of the Chemical Weapons
Convention, as well as international law. The Chemical
Weapons Convention is a multilateral instrument
adopted by 192 States. It is important that this model
multilateral agreement continue with the same integrity
and independence.

It is essential to maintain the credibility of that
international instrument in the face of allegations ofthe
use of toxic chemical weapons, agents or products, and
to that end any investigation must be conducted strictly
in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.
In that regard, we believe that all provisions of the
Convention should be used in any investigation to
address the concerns raised by the relevant parties in
accordance with the procedures set out therein. This
research must be broad, impartial and objective in order
to reach evidence-based conclusions.

Finally, it is essential that the countries concerned
use the appropriate diplomatic channels in order to
comply with the principles of mutual respect and
bilateral cooperation so that this situation can be resolved
through as much dialogue as possible, especially with
a View to strengthening the non-proliferation regime.
