Mr. Saudabayev (spoke in Russian): I thank you,
Sir, for your kind words concerning my country and for
your faith in the success of Kazakhstan's chairmanship
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE).

I am especially grateful for the support voiced by
all members of the Security Council for the proposal
16
made by President Nazarbayev, as Head of the State
chairing the OSCE this year, to convene a summit of
our organization. I thank all speakers for their kind
support, in-depth analysis of the situation in our zone
of common responsibility, and support for the priorities
of Kazakhstan's chairmanship-in-office of the OSCE.

I hope that today's meeting of the Security
Council will lend new and significant impetus to the
further strengthening of cooperation between the
OSCE and the Council, and that it has made a worthy
contribution to the noble objective of strengthening
security and mutual understanding in that huge
geographical area.
