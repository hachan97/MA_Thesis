The President: It is my understanding that the
Council is ready to vote on the draft resolution
(S/2006/51) before it. IfI hear no objection, I shall put
the draft resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:

Argentina, China, the Republic of the Congo,
Denmark, France, Ghana, Greece, Japan, Peru,
Qatar, Russian Federation, Slovakia, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United Republic of Tanzania, United States of
America

The President: There were 15 votes in
favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1653 (2006).

The hour is late, but it would be remiss on my
part and on the part of the delegation of the United
Republic of Tanzania if we were to conclude this
fruitful discussion without expressing our gratitude to
the Security Council for having agreed to hold this
open debate.

I thank all the members of the Security Council
for the spirit of cooperation with which they have
worked with my delegation to get this resolution
adopted and for having adopted it as a presidential text.
I pay tribute to all other members who, in one way or
another, made a valuable contribution to the elements
contained in the resolution.

The resolution that the Council has just adopted
is a demonstration of our renewed commitment to the
realization of durable peace and security for the
sustainable development of our region. We look
forward to its earnest implementation.

We are indebted to the Ministers and to all those
who have travelled from various capitals to participate
in the deliberations we have held.

Finally, I thank very warmly members of the
Secretariat for their hard work and for the
organizational support they have provided to make this
meeting a success.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 7.25 p.m.
