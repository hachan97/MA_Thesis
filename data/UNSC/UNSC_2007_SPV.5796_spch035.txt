The President: There are no further speakers
inscribed on my list. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.

May I take this opportunity, on behalf of the
Security Council, to thank Judge Pocar, Judge Byron,
Prosecutor Del Ponte and Prosecutor Jallow for taking
the time to brief the Council.

The meeting rose at 1.35 p.m.
