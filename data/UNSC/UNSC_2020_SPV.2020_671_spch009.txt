The delegation of Viet Nam would like to express its profound disappointment that the Security Council has been unable to adopt a resolution to renew the cross- border humanitarian assistance mechanism for Syria. It is our strong belief that discussion on the renewal will continue over the next few days to find an optimal solution for supporting the most vulnerable population. Viet Nam voted in favour of the two draft resolution contained in documents S/2020/654 and S/2020/658, bearing in mind the critical need to maintain life-saving humanitarian operations in Syria. It is crystal clear to us that the continuation of that mechanism must be ensured in order to respond to the considerable humanitarian needs on the ground at this moment in time. The humanitarian situation in Syria is alarming, especially as it is being further aggravated by the impact of the coronavirus disease pandemic and the exceptionally severe economic crisis. The gravity of the situation now continues to demonstrate the need for enhancing our humanitarian response. As the lives of millions of people are at stake, we would like to emphasize that the members of the Council cannot afford to not be united on this issue. Finding a way out of the current impasse through genuine dialogue and extensive consultations that focus solely on humanitarian aspects will requires the continued efforts of all parties. My delegation supports the efforts of the international community to provide humanitarian assistance to people across Syria and will continue to engage actively towards that shared noble goal. Without a doubt, it is of the utmost importance that the Security Council show unity in supporting people in need. The Syrian people and the international community expect nothing less from us.
