Mr. Pleuger (Germany): Germany welcomes the
adoption of today's resolution by consensus. It will be
a major contribution to strengthening the global fight
against international terrorism. This resolution comes
at a particularly appropriate time when, after serious
and particularly atrocious terrorist attacks in several
parts of the world, the resolve and unity of the
international community have been challenged anew.

Against this background, it is very important that
the resolution found the support of all Security Council
members. For Germany, maintaining consensus in
fighting international terrorism is of great value and is
obviously in the interest of all United Nations Member
States.

In this respect, Germany attaches particular
importance to an open and inclusive process in the
implementation of the resolution, in particular in the
working group foreseen in the resolution itself. The
working group should, among other things, consider
appropriate ways and means of operation, including the
possibility of compiling a list for identifying relevant
individuals, groups and entities.

Finally, I would also like to welcome the very
constructive contribution made by the representative of
Turkey, but let me also say that, in the interest of
transparency, we would have favoured a public debate
open to all United Nations Members before the
adoption of the resolution.
