The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform members of the Council that I have received
letters from the representatives of Kenya and Slovenia,
in which they request to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
accordance with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the discussion without the right to
vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objections, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Jalang'o
(Kenya) and Mr. Kirn (Slovenia) took the seats
reserved for them at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The President (spoke in French): I now give the
floor to the representative of Ethiopia.
