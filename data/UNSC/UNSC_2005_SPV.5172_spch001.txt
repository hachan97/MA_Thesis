The President (spoke in Chinese): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Terje Roed-
Larsen, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the
implementation of Security Council resolution 1559
(2004).

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Roed-Larsen to take a seat at the
Council table.

I welcome the presence of the Secretary-General,
His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, at this meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2005/272, which contains the first semi-
annual report of the Secretary-General to the Security
Council on the implementation of resolution 1559
(2004).

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Terje Roed-Larsen, Special Envoy of
the Secretary-General for the implementation of
Security Council resolution 1559 (2004). I now give
him the floor.
