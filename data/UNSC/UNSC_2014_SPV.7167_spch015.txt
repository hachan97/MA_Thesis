Mr. Hmoud (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): We would
also like to congratulate the Republic of Korea on its
assumption of the presidency of the Security Council
for this month. We thank the delegation of Nigeria for
all its work as President of the Council last month. And

we thank the Under-Secretary-General for Political
Affairs, Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, for his briefing.

Jordan would like to express its deep concern
about the most recent developments in Sloviansk in the
east of Ukraine, in addition to the spillover violence
in other regions of the country, including in Odessa.
We call upon all parties to demonstrate restraint. We
call for a return to calm and for de-escalation and
full cooperation with the monitors affiliated with the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE). We reiterate our appeal for the release of all
hostages held by rebels in Sloviansk, including the
OSCE monitors.

What is happening today in the east of Ukraine
is not civil war, but rather a mutiny. The actions
of the rebels, including the ongoing occupation of
seized Government buildings, the use of force, the
intimidation of civilians and threats to their life and
security, are in violation of the law. As Mr. Feltman
said, the continuation of those actions runs counter to
the letter and spirit of the Geneva agreement signed in
April. We reaffirm Ukraine's right to take appropriate
and effective measures to halt violations in the eastern
part of the country, preserve its unity and sovereignty,
safeguard the security of its citizens and uphold
constitutional and legal order.

At the same time, we call upon the Ukrainian
Government to work towards a peaceful solution to
the crisis and respect international norms in dealing
with the situation. It is important to uphold the relevant
human rights principles and to spare no effort in
immediately engaging in dialogue with stakeholders
to reach a peaceful solution. We must not lose the
opportunity brought about by the Geneva agreement,
which is a guarantee for calm in the east of the country
and for preserving the territorial unity of Ukraine. We
appeal to the stakeholders to implement the agreement
and bring pressure to bear on the rebels to end the crisis.

Rebels and all active stakeholders in Ukraine
should refrain from racist or hate speech. There is a
need to guarantee a return to stability in the country. We
call upon all players to help the Ukrainian authorities
in their efforts to guarantee success on the political
transition process and to start a comprehensive and
direct dialogue with all linguistic groups.

Finally, we underscore the importance of respecting
the legitimate aspirations of the Ukrainian people and of
working tirelessly to ensure that presidential elections

are held within the set time frame in May, in line with
those aspirations and while ensuring the future that
Ukrainian citizens deserve, within the framework of a
comprehensive, effective and lasting political process.
