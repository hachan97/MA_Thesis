The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank
Mr. Mufioz for the clarifications he has provided. Once
again, I thank him for the excellent service that he has
provided to the Committee and to the United Nations
during his tenure as Chairman of the Committee.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 12.15p.m.
