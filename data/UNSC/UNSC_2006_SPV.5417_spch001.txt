The President (spoke in Chinese): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Lebanon and the Syrian Arab
Republic in which they request to be invited to
participate in the consideration of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

On behalf of the Council, I extend a warm
welcome to His Excellency Mr. Fouad Siniora, Prime
Minister of Lebanon. I request the Deputy Chief of
Protocol to escort the Prime Minister to his seat at the
Council table.

Mr. Fouad Siniora, Prime Minister of Lebanon,
was escorted to a seat at the Council table.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Atieh
(Syrian Arab Republic) took the seat reserved for
him at the Council table.

The President (spoke in Chinese): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

I welcome the presence of the Secretary-General,
His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, at this meeting.

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Fouad
Siniora, Prime Minister of Lebanon.
