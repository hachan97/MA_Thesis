Mr. Petrella (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): I should
like to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this open
meeting of the Security Council to hear the Chairman of
the Committee established pursuant to resolution 864 (1993)
concerning the situation in Angola, Ambassador Robert
Fowler of Canada. We should like to thank Ambassador
Fowler for his second report, which is certainly very
valuable, and for the statement that he has just made.

It is clear that the effectiveness of the sanctions
regime against UNITA is essential for the achievement of
lasting peace in Angola. It seems to us that the objectives
of the trip have been further carried forward by the
recommendations made, and we hope that the members of
the panels will be able to make best use of those
recommendations so as to help the Council.

We fully agree with the need to raise the cost of
military equipment to UNITA to the maximum so as to
force it to seek a political solution as quickly as possible.
The need for States to provide in good faith as much
information as possible to the sanctions Committee seems
to be an indispensable element, given the points made by
Ambassador Fowler in his report, particularly those on
page 11 of the document before us.

In conclusion, we are sure that Ambassador Fowler's
initiatives will be very useful in improving the
effectiveness of other sanctions regimes and, accordingly,
the effectiveness of one of the most valuable tools
available to the Security Council in ensuring the
implementation of its resolutions.
