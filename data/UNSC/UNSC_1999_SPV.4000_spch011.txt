Mr. Buallay (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): My
delegation profoundly regrets the strike on the Embassy of
China in Belgrade because of the ongoing war in the
Balkans in recent weeks, and we extend our sympathy to
the delegation of China. On this occasion, we affirm that
the crisis in Kosovo must be resolved by diplomatic means,
as has been reaffirmed by Secretary-General Kofi Annan in
his statement in this connection.

A diplomatic solution must ensure to the Kosovar
Albanians all their essential rights to live in dignity,
security and stability. In this regard, we affirm the right
of all refugees to return to their homes in safety and
security.

My delegation encourages all the parties concerned
to intensify their efforts to resolve the crisis by diplomatic
means as soon as possible. Indeed, every day that goes by
without a solution means more victims. As the Secretary-
General himself said in his statement during his latest
visit to Germany, it is our hope that the chapter on this
bloody conflict will come to an end as soon as possible
in a way that does justice to the Kosovar Albanians.
