The President (spoke in Russian): It is my
understanding that the Security Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution in document
S/1999/ 1083. If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote.

 

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I will first give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the voting.
