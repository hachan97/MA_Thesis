The President (spoke in French): There are no
further speakers inscribed on my list. The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

In accordance with the understanding reached
earlier, I invite the members of the Council to proceed
to informal consultations following the adjournment of
this meeting.
