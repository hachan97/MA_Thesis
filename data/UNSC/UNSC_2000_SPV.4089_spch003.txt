The President: I wish to thank Mrs. Ogata for her
participation in our discussion this morning and would
like to acknowledge that Secretary-General Kofi Annan
asked to be remembered to her in his absence from this
room during her statement. He had to leave for an urgent
meeting, but he wanted to express his full support for her
statement and asked me to do so.

I also wanted to mention that in addition to the
students I introduced earlier, we have many important
representatives here today from refugee organizations
from around the world. The Chairman and Director of the
International Rescue Committee are here; Refugees
International is represented; so is the Women's
Commission for Refugees, as well as many other
organizations. I thank all of them for being here today,
and I hope they will keep their voices loud and firm,
because the non-governmental organization community is
so important.

I will now invite members of the Council to address
specific questions to Mrs. Ogata. We want to have an
informal discussion, at the end of which I will offer a
presidential Statement.
