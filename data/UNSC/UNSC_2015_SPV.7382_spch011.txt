Mr. Ramirez Carrefio (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela supports, and voted in favour of,
resolution 2201 (2015) on the situation in Yemen. We
are convinced that a peaceful solution to the political
crisis is the only possible avenue open to all the parties
to achieve strong and lasting peace in the country.

Venezuela reiterates its rejection of any illegal
unilateral action that undermines the political and
constitutional status of Yemen. As a matter of
principle, our country always rejects coups d'e'tat and
political destabilization. Our country reiterates its
condemnation of the use of violence and terrorism in
all its manifestations, regardless of motivation or who
commits it. All political stakeholders must respect the
exising road map and the Gulf Cooperation Council
initiatives aimed at opening up a path towards a political
transition in this brotherly country through dialogue.

We once again emphasize our resolute support
for respect for the sovereignty, political independence
and territorial integrity of Yemen. We hope that this
Security Council resolution will serve to encourage the
parties to follow the road map charted to achieve peace
and political stability, in line with the National Dialogue
Conference outcomes of the National Partnership
Agreement. National dialogue must continue, and we
must insist on an effort in that regard that involves all
political, ethnic and religious groups in the country.

We call once again for the release of President
Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour, as well as the
members of the Cabinet who are currently being
detained.

Finally, Venezuela reiterates its full support for
the good offices of the Secretary-General's Special
Adviser, Mr. Jamal Benomar, as he endeavours to act
as facilitator in resolving the political crisis with the
consent of all the parties and in line with the interests
of the Yemeni people.
