Mrs. D'Achon (France) (Spoke in French): I, too,
would like to thank Mr. Lubbers for his very
comprehensive briefing on the situation of refugees in
conflict situations. This is an issue that members of the
Council follow very carefully.

In the light of the recent displacements of which
Mr. Lubbers spoke, I would like to ask him two sets of
questions. The first concerns West Africa. Given that
the United Nations now has three peacekeeping
operations with robust mandates in the region, can Mr.
Lubbers explain how the Office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) envisions
the possible synergy among those three operations, in
particular with respect to refugees? Secondly, in the
light of the upcoming elections in C6te d'lvoire and
Liberia, could he tell the Council whether the
repatriation of refugees and the return of displaced
persons are being organized in such a way that those
individuals too can participate in the upcoming
elections? Specifically, do the UNHCR programmes
address the issue of registering those refugees and
displaced persons on the voter rolls?

My other two questions concern the situation in
Darfur, the Sudan, in particular the problem of the
refugees in Chad. France is particularly concerned at
the situation in that region. As is known, at the start of
this year, France disbursed â‚¬200,000 to UNHCR for its
action in Chad, in addition to the â‚¬150,000 disbursed to
the French non-governmental organization cited by Mr.
Lubbers, Premiere Urgence, which also works in Chad.
Because it is difficult to get exact figures on the
number of refugees crossing the border right now and
because we are dealing with nomadic peoples, I wish to
ask Mr. Lubbers whether he has an estimate of the
current figures and, in particular, whether he foresees a
substantial increase in the flow of refugees into Chad.
If such an increase is foreseen, is it sustainable, given
the security situation as described by preceding
speakers?
