Mr. Konfourou (Mali) (spoke in French): My
delegation welcomes the good news we heard this
morning from the Under-Secretary-General for
Peacekeeping Affairs concerning the difficult conflicts
that plague the Horn of Africa.

We support what the French delegation said this
morning about the linkage between the termination of
the mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) and the
Boundary Commission. In resolution 1344 (2001), we
agreed to address a letter to the Secretary-General
concerning cost estimates for UNMEE's funding needs
for the Boundary Commission. We would like to find
out today what progress has been made in this field,
and if we could perhaps have those cost estimates by
the end of the month. My delegation calls on all of the
parties to the conflict fully to cooperate to resolve the
issues that are still pending.
