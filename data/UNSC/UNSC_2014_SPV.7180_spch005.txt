Lithuania, Luxembourg, Nigeria, Republic of
Korea, Rwanda, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland and United States of America

The President: There were 13 votes in favour,
2 votes against and no abstentions. The draft resolution
has not been adopted, owing to the negative vote of a
permanent member of the Council.

Council who wish to make a statement after the vote.
