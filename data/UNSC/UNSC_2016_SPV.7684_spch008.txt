Mr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): Ukraine voted today in
favour of resolution 2285 (2016), given its conviction
that the Council has to ensure that the United Nations
Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara
(MINURSO) continues to conduct its operations,
which are Vital for peace, stability and security in
Western Sahara. The resolution adopted is important,
not just for the sake of the continued work of the
Mission but for creating the proper environment and
providing the necessary impetus for a relaunch of the
political process so as to achieve a lasting and mutually
acceptable solution.

At the same time, we fully share the concerns, and
even the frustrations, of some Council members about
the current circumstances in which the Mission has
to operate. We therefore emphasize the urgent need
to restore the Mission's full capabilities, including
political functions, as soon as possible.

We commend the Group of Friends of Western
Sahara for their efforts aimed at resolving the current
situation. Ukraine calls upon all parties to cooperate in
good faith with the operations of MINURSO and to take
the necessary steps to ensure the security, unhindered
movement and full freedom of access of the United
Nations and associated personnel in carrying out their
mandate in conformity with existing agreements.

In conclusion, I would like to express Ukraine's
support for the United Nations efforts to find a solution
to the issue of Western Sahara.
