The President (spoke in Russian): I should like
to inform the members of the Council that I have
received letters from the representatives of
Afghanistan, India, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in which
they request to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the discussion, without the right to
vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Farhddi
(Afghanistan) took a seat at the Council table;
Mr. Sharma (India), Ms. Ibraimova (Kyrgyzstan)
and Mr. Alimov (Tajikistan) took the seats
reserved for them at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The President (spoke in Russian): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2000/1202, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by India, Kyrgyzstan, the
Russian Federation, Tajikistan and the United States of
America.

I give the floor to the representative of
Afghanistan.
