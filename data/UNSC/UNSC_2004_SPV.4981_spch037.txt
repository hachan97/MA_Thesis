The President: I thank Mr. Bryant for his
additional comments and clarifications.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. May I take this opportunity to express, on behalf
of the Council, our appreciation to the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Klein,
and to Chairman Bryant for taking the time to come to
brief the Council.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 12.50 p.m.
