Mr. Shen Guofang (China)(interpretation from Chinese): First of all, the Chinese delegation would like to
welcome Vice-Minister Carneiro, who is attending the
formal meeting of the Security Council today. We should
also like to thank him for his statement.

The peace process in Angola has been in progress for
several years, with efforts being made on all sides,
including by the Angolan Government and the United
Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA). The vast
majority of the provisions of the Lusaka Protocol have been
implemented, and the completion of the Angolan peace
process is now in sight. The international community is
encouraged by this fact.

However, it is unfortunate that, because of repeated
delays by UNITA in fully implementing its commitments
under the Lusaka Protocol, the peace process has been
greatly hindered. On many occasions, UNITA has gone so
far as to engage in violent actions, attacking Government
authorities and MONUA personnel and harming large
numbers of innocent civilians, thereby causing a
deterioration of the situation in Angola.

None of us wishes to see such developments. Faced
with this situation, the Security Council has no alternative
but to take further sanction measures against UNITA to
make it cooperate with the Angolan Government and fulfil
its commitments promptly and unconditionally. The
delegation of China appreciates the Angolan Government's
insistence upon completing the peace process through
political means and strongly urges UNITA to heed the
demands of the Angolan people and the voice of the
international community, to seize this final opportunity to
fulfil its commitments swiftly and fully and, working
together with the Angolan Government, to achieve national
reconciliation.

The delegation of China will vote in favour of the
draft resolution.
