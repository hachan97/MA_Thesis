Mr. Vitrenko (Ukraine): I will be brief. Russia is
the sole supplier of arms, heavy weaponry, mercenaries,
ammunition and a whole host of other deadly weapons
to Russian separatists and terrorists in eastern Ukraine,
including the infamous Buk missile that downed
Malaysia Airlines flight MH-17, killing the almost 300
people on board. Russia therefore has neither a moral
nor legal right to lecture any delegation in the Council,
especially given that it is recognized by the General
Assembly as a party to the conflict and an occupying
Power in Ukraine.
