Mr. Maquieira (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): First,
I wish to join in the condolences that are being
conveyed to the Governments of Pakistan and
Afghanistan on the recent air crash. I also wish to
thank of Mr. Guehenno, Ambassador Nishimura and
Ambassador Braun for their presence at this meeting.
They have given us comprehensive information about
developments in Afghanistan.

For the sake of brevity, I should like to ask just a
few questions of Mr. Nishimura and of Mr. Braun. With
respect to Mr. Nishimura's briefing: bearing in mind
the numerous problems that have been mentioned, in
particular the influence of local chiefs and militia
commanders in the various parts of the country, how
does Mr. Nishimura think his work should be focused,
and what is the most important challenge to be faced?
Which parts of the country does he consider will be the
most difficult to integrate into the programme?

I have a second question for Ambassador
Nishimura concerning the disarmament and
reintegration effort. We in the United Nations have
quite a history of such efforts - some of them more
successful than others. Perhaps he could indicate
whether any of these experiences have served as a basis
for his endeavours and to what extent that experience
can be applied to the case of Afghanistan.

With respect to the comprehensive briefing that
we received from Ambassador Braun, I should like to
say first of all that we are sure that this is a very
complex undertaking. We know that the Afghan
Government lacks the resources to pay police wages
and that therefore the contributions of the international
community are essential.

I should therefore like to ask Ambassador Brown
how he perceives this problem, and does he believe
that these forces must have a balanced ethnic
composition?
