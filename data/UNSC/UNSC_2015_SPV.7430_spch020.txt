The President: I would like to thank the Permanent
Representative of New Zealand for his service and to
wish him the best of luck in the years to come, as I do
for the representative of the United Kingdom. I thank
them both for their invaluable contributions. We will all
need their wisdom and wise counsel in the future and
hope they will not be stinting with their advice.
