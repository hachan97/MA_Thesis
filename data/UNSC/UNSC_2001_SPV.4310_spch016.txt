Mr. Chen Xu (China) (spoke in Chinese): Like
other delegations, we wish to thank Under-Secretary-
General Guehenno for his briefing this morning.

The Chinese delegation is very pleased with the
positive developments, in particular the establishment
of the Temporary Security Zone (TSZ).

As Mr. Legwaila has said, the establishment of
the TSZ marks the formal separation of the forces of
the two parties. Indeed, this is a prerequisite for the
complete implementation of the peace accord. We
appreciate the positive efforts and sincerity of both
parties, as well as the efforts made by the United
Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea.

At the same time, the establishment of the TSZ
does not mean that the problem has been resolved. We
hope that the two parties will seize and cherish this
opportunity and that they will promote mutual
confidence by taking real action to properly settle such
issues as the demarcation of borders, the establishment
of direct flights and the repatriation of refugees in
order to lay a solid foundation for a final settlement of
their dispute.
