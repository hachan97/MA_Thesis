with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Danilo Turk,

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Tiirk to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its

meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
