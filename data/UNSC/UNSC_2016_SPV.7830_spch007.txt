Mr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): As it did last year, my delegation voted against
the discussion by the Security Council of the human
rights situation in the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea.

We have often expressed our opposition to the
Security Council's inclusion of human rights issues
on its agenda. We believe that they do not fall within
the Council's purview and should be considered in
specialized bodies, first and foremost the United
Nations Human Rights Council. The Security Council
should concentrate on issues that represent a true
threat to international peace and security. Regularly
burdening the Council's agenda with issues that are
not within its remit, such as today's item, inevitably
weakens the Council's focus and force and undermines
the effectiveness of its work.

If we consider the potential benefits of today's
meeting, we may draw the conclusion from many years
of experience in United Nations human rights bodies
that wholesale criticism or the use of labels has never
led to positive results, which can be achieved only by
fostering trust and interaction among countries. Once
again, we must note that today's discussion is another
step in the opposite direction.
At this stage, the main goal ofthe Security Council
should be to create conditions as soon as possible for
the resumption of negotiations on the nuclear issue on
the Korean peninsula. At the same time, our priorities
should be to seek a peaceful resolution to the current
problems. The current complex situation should not
be a pretext for increasing foreign military capacity.
We call on all sides to ease tensions, step back from
militaristic rhetoric and restart the political process as
soon as possible to overcome this impasse.
