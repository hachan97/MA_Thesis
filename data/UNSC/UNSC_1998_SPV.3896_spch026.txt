remaining on my list for this meeting. In view of the
lateness of the hour, I intend, with the concurrence of the
members of the Council, to suspend the meeting until
3.15 this afternoon.

The meeting was suspended at 1.25 p.m. and
resumed at 3.25 p.m.

The President: The next speaker inscribed on my
list is the representative of Norway. I invite him to take
a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
