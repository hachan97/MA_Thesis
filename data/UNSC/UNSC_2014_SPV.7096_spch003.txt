The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank the
Secretary-General for his statement. I appreciate his
commitment and diplomatic activities. In the light of
ongoing events, I understand that he will now have to
leave the Chamber. I therefore wish him every success
in his good offices today.
I now give the floor to the Permanent Observer of
the Observer State of Palestine.
