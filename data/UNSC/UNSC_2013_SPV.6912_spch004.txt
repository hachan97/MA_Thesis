Mr. Dabbashi (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): I did
not request the floor but since I have been given it, I
would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you,
Mr. President, on your assumption of the presidency of
the Council for this month. I am sure that your wisdom
will give rise to successful results. I would also like
to thank Mr. Mitri, Special Representative of the
Secretary-General for Libya, for his comprehensive
briefing. I think that the briefing has clarified the
situation in Libya in all its aspects.

We still depend on the United Nations Support
Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) to assist the Government
during this difficult transition period from the conflict
towards State institution-building. As the Council will
understand, it is a difficult period, in which we have
had to face a great number of problems. We feel that it
is extremely important for UNMSIL to remain in Libya
at this critical time because we need its advice in many
areas, in particular security sector reform, preparations
for drafting the constitution and elections. Those are
complex issues for us because we lack experience in
such areas. That has been the case for the past five or
six decades.

I would like to warmly commend Mr. Mitri on
his efforts and his capacity to build confidence. Like
his predecessor, Ian Martin, he has established great
trust between the Libyan authorities and the United
Nations mission. I note that he is working in a cordial
environment of close cooperation. I am sure that that
will certainly help the Libyan authorities and will make
a difference. We hope that the Security Council will
continue to provide us with such assistance.
