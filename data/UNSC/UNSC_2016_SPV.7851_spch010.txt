The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now make
an explanation of vote in my national capacity.

Liberia is a success story on the Council's agenda.
It started as an extremely complex situation and,
thanks to the joint efforts of all Liberian society and
the leadership of President Johnson-Sirleaf, we are

entering an electoral year with very good prospects for
stability and a peaceful transition of power.

The international community has made significant
efforts to support the peacebuilding process, and the
United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) is the
embodiment of such efforts. Resolution 2333 (2016)
extends the final United Nations presence in the country
to affirm and end aprocess that is firmly headed towards
success, although there are some aspects that still
require attention, such as the appropriate maintenance
of the human rights component.

We voted in favour of resolution 2333 (2016)
because we are convinced that peace missions are not
designed to go on indefinitely and in the understanding
that this renewal ofthe UNMIL mandate is and must be
the final one.

I resume my functions as President of the Council.
I give the floor to the representative of Liberia.
