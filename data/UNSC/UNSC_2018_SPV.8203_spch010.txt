Mr. Tanoh-Boutchoue (Cote d'Ivoire) (spoke in French): Cote d'Ivoire was saddened to learn about
the use of a chemical nerve agent on British soil on
4 March in Salisbury. It expresses its sincere solidarity
with the British Government and wishes those affected
a speedy recovery. Cote d'Ivoire has always condemned
the use of chemical weapons, regardless of the method
employed. It also demands that light be shed on the
incident in Salisbury.
