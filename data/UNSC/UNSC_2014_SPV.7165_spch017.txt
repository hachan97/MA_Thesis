Mr. Mangaral (Chad) (spoke in French): I would
like to thank Under-Secretary-General for Political
Affairs, Mr. Feltman, for his briefing.

Chad, like other Member States, is extremely
concerned by the deterioration of the situation in eastern
Ukraine. Following a period of relative calm following
the Geneva declaration, we are today faced with new
circumstances, marked by the kidnapping of members
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe mission, the attempted assassination of
the mayor of Kharkiv, and the occupation of public
buildings in Lugansk and elsewhere by pro-Russian
elements. Chad condemns those violent acts, which
undermine the negotiation and reconciliation efforts in
Ukraine. Chad calls for the release of the hostages and
for all parties to be calm and restrained.

Given the serious situation, Chad reiterates its
appeal to those countries with influence over the
parties to use every possible means at their disposal to
give initiate dialogue between them. We are convinced
that the solution to the problem in Ukraine can only
be political. It should be sought with respect for the
territorial integrity, sovereignty and unity of Ukraine,
pursuant to the Charter of the United Nations. To
that end, we urge the international community, and
the Security Council in particular, to redouble their
efforts to pursue mediation so as to bring the two sides
closer together in seeking a peaceful solution in full
respect for human rights and particularly for the rights
minorities in Ukraine.
