Mr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): First of all, I
would like to thank His Excellency Mr. Ismail Omar
Guelleh, President of the Republic of Djibouti, for his
presence and his statement to the Council. I also thank
the representative of Eritrea for his participation.

My delegation has followed closely the situation
along the border between Djibouti and Eritrea. We
remain concerned about the sharp escalation in tension
and the suspension of diplomatic relations between the
two countries as a result of their border dispute. In our
judgement, that dispute, if left unchecked, could spill
over into a wider regional conflict, with greater
potential consequences.

We call for maximum restraint by both parties,
for their commitment to a ceasefire and for a
withdrawal by Eritrea of its forces to the status quo
ante. We urge the two countries to cooperate and to
engage in diplomatic efforts to diffuse tension and
generate political space for a peaceful resolution of the
dispute.

My delegation commends and supports the
mediation efforts of the African Union, the Arab
League and the Organization of the Islamic Conference
to find ways to end the conflict and the dispute. We
encourage the Secretary-General, in coordination with
regional stakeholders, to use his offices to develop
confidence-building measures and engage both parties
in dialogue with a view to finding a peaceful solution
to the dispute that is in conformity with the
fundamental principles of international law and the
United Nations Charter.
