The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now make
a statement in my national capacity. I will limit my
remarks to two things. First, I thank Mr. Jeffrey Feltman
for his briefing. Secondly, I would like to announce that
I have requested the Secretariat to distribute the text
of my statement in order to save some time. It is past
1 pm. That is my small contribution to gaining a little
bit of time.

I shall now give the floor to four delegations under
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.
I would like to remind all speakers to limit their
statements to no more than four minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to circulate the texts in writing and to deliver
a condensed variation when speaking in the Chamber.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Lebanon.
