The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Terje Roed-Larsen, Special
Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process and
Personal Representative of the Secretary-General.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Roed-Larsen to take a seat at the
Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations. At this meeting, the Security
Council will hear a briefing by Mr. Terje Reed-Larsen,
Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process
and Personal Representative of the Secretary-General. I
now give him the floor.
