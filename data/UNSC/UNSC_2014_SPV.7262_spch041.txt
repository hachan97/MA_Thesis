Ms. Honore: Iwould like contributors to rest assured
that I have taken careful note of their observations, as
well as those made by Council members, other Member
States, including Haiti, and the multilateral organization.
Those observations and recommendations, based on
the mandate entrusted by the Council to the Mission
to support security and stabilization in Haiti have
focused on the Mission's core functions of support for
the Haitian National Police, the strengthening of the
rule of law and the promotion of human rights, and
increased electoral management capacity. I have also
taken note of the Council's expectations of the Mission
with respect to important governance issues, such as
elections and institution-building.

On behalf of the Mission's staff- military, police,
civilians, both international and Haitian, and United
Nations Volunteers - I thank everyone for the many
expressions of support for the Mission's efforts. We
look forward to continued service in the interests of the
people of Haiti, in collaboration with the Government,
its international partners and the United Nations
country team, on the basis of the mandate of the
Security Council.
