Mr. Davies (Sierra Leone): I want to thank the
Council for organizing this meeting and the President
and the Prosecutor of the Special Court for Sierra
Leone for briefing the Council on the considerable
achievements that the Court has made.

As already highlighted by previous speakers, we
have come a long way since the cessation of hostilities.
We have been able to successfully organize three
elections, the last of which brought a change of
Government that saw the former opposition party
leader, President Ernest Bai Koroma of the All People's
Congress, form the present Government.

Sierra Leone has had a unique experience in its
peacebuilding process. Being maybe the first country
to introduce a hybrid Special Court and a Truth and
Reconciliation Commission in which perpetrators of
atrocities and victims were able to expel the venom in
them, whilst those responsible for serious atrocities
were brought to justice in the Special Court.

I want to use this opportunity to thank the
members of the international community who have
consistently supported the Court, both financially and
morally, and to appeal for their continued support with
a view to concluding the Court's valuable work until it
completes its deliberations early in 2011. We note with
satisfaction that two trials have already been
completed, with two remaining trials to be concluded.

Let me once again thank the Council for this
meeting and President Winter and Prosecutor Rapp for
their lucid presentations.
