The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Burundi, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

On behalf of the Council, I extend a warm
welcome to His Excellency Mr. Didace Kiganahe,
Minister of Justice of Burundi.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Kiganahe
(Burundi) took a seat at the Council table.

The President (spoke in French): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Ralph Zacklin,
Assistant Secretary-General for Legal Affairs.

It is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2005/158, which contains the text of a
letter dated 11 March 2005 from the Secretary-General
addressed to the President of the Security Council
transmitting the report of the assessment mission
dispatched to Burundi with the objective of considering
the advisability and feasibility of establishing an
international judicial commission of inquiry.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Ralph Zacklin, Assistant Secretary-
General for Legal Affairs. I now give him the floor.
