Mr. Adechi (Benin) (spoke in French): At this
stage in our discussions, we do not have any questions
to ask. We would like to make a few comments.

At the outset, we would like to thank the
President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President
Obasanjo, for having kindly come to meet with the
Council in his capacity as current Chairman of the
African Union. We also welcome the presence here of
His Excellency the President of the Republic of
Namibia, Mr. Sam Nujoma.

The African Union (AU) was created three years
ago to speed up the process of integrating African
States and to reinforce the capacity of the continent to
shoulder increased responsibilities in the quest for
effective solutions to its problems. The very instructive
briefing that President Obasanjo has just given the
Council on the situation in Africa clearly shows his
resolve. However, we must recognize that the African
Union cannot maintain this role, which it assumed with
courage and an acute sense of urgency, if the
international community does not mobilize resources
commensurate with the gravity of the situation to
effectively support the work of the African Union. We
now know what that requires, having been informed by
the most authoritative voice, that of the current
Chairman of the AU.

Accordingly, we wish to stress that assistance
from the international community must be for the long
term. Recent studies reveal that in Africa, when the
post-conflict situation is not managed properly, in 60
per cent of the cases the conflict resumes. It is a
serious challenge. Therefore the United Nations
system, in partnership with the African Union, must set
up a coordinating mechanism and realize the available
potential: coordination of actors and coordination of
action.
