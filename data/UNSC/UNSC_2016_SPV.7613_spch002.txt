Mr. Aboulatta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Egypt
welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 2263
(2016), on the extension of the mandate of the United
Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, out of our
conviction that the Force is carrying out an important
role in supporting stability in Cyprus, particularly
in the light of the positive momentum observed in
the negotiating process between both Cypriot parties
and based on what both parties have expressed with
respect to their complete commitment to reaching
a comprehensive and sustainable settlement for the
Cypriot issue as quickly as possible.

Notwithstanding that, Egypt is convinced that
it was important that the thirteenth preambular
paragraph of the resolution, indicating the nature and
identity of the military bases in the north of Cyprus, be
included in order to reflect the reality on the ground.
In addition, when dealing with the issue of missing
persons, a humanitarian issue of primary importance,
it is necessary that all the parties take up their
responsibilities in the matter.

Since Egypt stresses the importance of exerting
every effort to make the political process succeed, we
reiterate that all parties must act responsibly during the
negotiations and abstain from any acts that could lead
to increased tension or disrupt the positive environment
that prevails at present. In that context, Egypt reiterates
that the Cypriot settlement must abide by the relevant
Security Council resolutions and the current regional
political conditions.
