The President: I thank the Prime Minister of
Somalia for his concluding statement.

As I said at the outset of this meeting, it has been
a Council presidency priority for Ireland to ensure a
long overdue open discussion on Somalia. We have, I
believe, had a comprehensive and useful exchange of
Views today. In the coming days, members of the
Security Council will work on a draft presidential
statement, which will draw on the full discussion that
we have just had. It is my hope that we will be in a
position to finalize the presidential statement early next
week and that the statement will demonstrate the
commitment of the Security Council to support
Somalia and the Somali people.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 5.15 pm.
