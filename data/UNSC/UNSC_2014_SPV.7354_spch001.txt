The President (spoke in French): I wish to warmly
welcome Minister Jean Asselborn of Luxembourg to
the Security Council Chamber. His participation is
an affirmation of the importance of the subject matter
under discussion.

In accordance with rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure, I invite the representative
of Israel to participate in this meeting.

I propose that the Council invite the Permanent
Observer of the Observer State of Palestine to the United
Nations, to participate in the meeting, in accordance
with the provisional rules of procedure and the previous
practice in this regard.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them document
S/2014/9l6, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by Jordan.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. I
shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
