Mr. Aboulatta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the
outset, I would like to seize the opportunity to welcome
the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Colombia to this
historic meeting of the Council. We are honoured to be
part of this event.

Resolution 2366 (2017), which was just adopted, is
the outcome of collective efforts for peace in Colombia.
It pushes the peace forward towards a new era, based
on solid ground and with the full and strong support of
the United Nations. It lays the foundation for sustaining
peace and prevents the relapse into conflict based on
national ownership which includes a clear strategy set
by the Government and other parties to the conflict.
I would like to commend the firm commitment of the
parties to the implementation of the Final Agreement
for Ending the Conflict and Building a Stable and
Lasting Peace, despite the major challenges that they
both faced throughout the past year.

The adoption of this resolution highlights the
unanimous will to support the Government in its
efforts to achieve peace. Egypt therefore sponsored and
voted in favour of the resolution as an indication of our
firm support for the Colombian Government and for
bringing sustainable and lasting peace to that country.

Before I conclude, I would like to point out the
important lesson to be learned from the peace process
in Colombia. We should gather lessons that we can
use as we look into other dossiers on the Council's
agenda. The experience of Colombia proved that
political solutions, the commitment of the parties to a
conflict, the support of regional States and the United
Nations, and coordination among the different parties
concerned, in addition to the unity of the Council as it
deals with certain topics, have all contributed directly
to ending the conflict and achieving sustainable peace.

In conclusion, once again, Egypt commends the
people and Government of Colombia on achieving this
historic agreement.
