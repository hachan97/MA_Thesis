The President (spoke in Chinese): I thank Mr.
Prendergast for his comprehensive briefing.

On behalf of the entire membership of the
Council, I would like to bid farewell to the Permanent
Representative of France, Ambassador Jean-David
Levitte. I understand that our respected colleague,
Ambassador Levitte, is here with us in this Chamber
for the last time before he undertakes his next
important assignment.

Ambassador Levitte has made important
contributions to the work of the Council through
diplomatic skills, an affable manner and a sense of
collegiality which have made him a highly effective
representative of his country. I am certain that he will
continue to use his talents in his new assignment. We
will not forget our colleague Ambassador Levitte. He
will be remembered as one who always strived to work
in cooperation and harmony with other members of the
Council. In bidding him a fond farewell, Council
members, including myself, wish him great success and
fulfilment in his future endeavours.
