Mr. Kafando (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French):
At the outset, we would like thank the Director of the
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for
the briefing that he has just given us. When the need
for a debate on the humanitarian situation in the Sudan
arose, we saw no objection to it, aware as we are of the
difficult humanitarian situation currently prevailing in
Darfur and of the need to find a rapid solution to it.

However, in order to take full stock of the
realities in the field, we felt that it would have been
better to wait until next week for a comprehensive
assessment of the difficulties of humanitarian
assistance in Darfur on the basis of the reliable
information that we await from the assessment mission,
including that which the Joint Chief Mediator, who is
shortly expected in New York, could give us. We hope
that those joint assessments will enable us to envisage
the most appropriate solutions to address the current
difficulties.

The lessons that we draw once again from the
humanitarian situation in Darfur are that the concern to
do justice must not create further suffering for the
civilian population. We must recognize that the
deplorable situation cannot be separated from the
decision of the International Criminal Court to
prosecute the President of the Sudan.

For its part, the Government of Burkina Faso,
which deeply deplores the expulsion of the
non-governmental organizations by the Sudanese
authorities, will continue to encourage and to urge the
Government of the Sudan to find the ways and means
to satisfactorily respond to the humanitarian situation
in Darfur. We can affirm that contacts continue in that
direction, and of course we hope that they will be
successful. The main issue is to restore confidence
between the Sudan authorities and humanitarian actors
to alleviate the suffering of the population of Darfur.
