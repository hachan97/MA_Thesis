Mr. Alotaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): The
Security Council is meeting to discuss the use of
chemical weapons. Regardless of the wording of the
agenda item that we are discussing today, be it "Letter
from the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission
of the United Kingdom" or "Proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction", we believe that this is an issue of
concern. Attempted assassination is a dangerous crime
that has an impact on the security and safety of civilians
and could undermine relations among Member States.

The State of Kuwait holds a principled and firm
position condemning the use, production, acquisition,
stockpiling or retention of chemical weapons, as well as
their direct or indirect transfer. This position is based
on article I of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
We call on all Member States that have ratified the
Convention to adhere to its provisions and eliminate all
their stockpiles of toxic chemical material.

The United Kingdom called for the convening
of this meeting because of a hostile act committed
on its territory that violates international norms and
conventions related to chemical weapons. We underscore
the right of the United Kingdom or any other country
subjected to similar acts to undertake all the necessary
investigations and carry out the appropriate measures
in order to protect its national security and punish the
perpetrators of such criminal act.

Lastly, we call on all States that bear a special
responsibility in maintaining international peace and
security, as well as all other States that express their
commitment to the Charter of the United Nations, to
undertake clear and sincere steps towards achieving the
objective of creating a world free of nuclear weapons
and weapons of mass destruction. In that regard, we
recall resolution 2325 (2016), which reaffirms that
the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons and their means of delivery poses a danger to
international peace and security.
