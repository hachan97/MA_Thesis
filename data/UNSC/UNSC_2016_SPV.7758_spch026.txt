Mr. Safronkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I apologize to all of those present in the
Chamber, Minister Lajcak and Ambassador Lodhi, for
requesting the floor again. I will be very brief.

Today's meeting was supposed to be a serious,
substantive discussion on strengthening international
efforts to prevent weapons of mass destruction from
falling into the hands of terrorists. In his statement,
the representative of Ukraine made a deliberate
attempt to devalue today's discussion by bringing up
baseless accusations against Russia. I believe they
came, understandably, as a complete surprise to most
of those present in the Chamber. There is no room
for such conduct in the Security Council. Theirs was
a classic attempt to justify their own actions and to
shift responsibility for the problem onto others. The
Ukrainian party has deliberately moved away from
conscientiously implementing the Minsk agreement
and is counting on a military solution to an internal
Ukrainian conflict.
