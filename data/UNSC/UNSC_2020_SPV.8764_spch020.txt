Mr. Geng Shuang (China) (spoke in Chinese): With regard to the explanations offered by the representative of the United Kingdom and others, I must say that I still fail to understand. As we said earlier, in accordance with rule 39, we have invited other civil society representatives, non-governmental organizations and experts to brief Security Council members whose professionalism and representativeness were absolutely no match for Mr. Bustani. However, in those instances no objections have been raised so that the work of the Council might proceed. I fail to understand why the representatives of the United Kingdom and other members have such difficulty in accepting the invitation issued to Mr. Bustani as a briefer. I wish to point out that this simply exposes a double standard. Why should it be possible that some people can be invited as briefers butnot Mr. Bustani? His expertise and representativeness are totally beyond dispute. I would hope that our colleague from the United Kingdom and others can, with regard to the issues on the Council's agenda, listen to different views and keep an open mind on the issues under discussion. What I think is that they simply do not want to listen to differing views. They say that they are objective and fair, but that is simply not the case. I therefore still insist that we should first put to the vote the challenge to the presidency of the Council raised by the representative of the United Kingdom.
