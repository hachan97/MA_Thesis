Mr. Chen Xu (China) (spoke in Chinese): I will
be very brief. First of all, like other colleagues, I would
like to thank Mr. Oshima for his briefing. We would
also like to thank Mr. Georges Chikoti, Vice-Minister
for External Relations of Angola, for his important
statement.

The humanitarian situation in Angola is a source
of great concern to us. We have noted that the United
Nations and other international relief organizations are
carrying out activities there and that the Angolan
Government has taken actions in response. We hope
that these efforts will be effective as soon as possible
and that the Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal will
receive sufficient funding.

The humanitarian situation in Angola is related
closely to the security situation and the peace process
there. As far as the Security Council is concerned, we
must redouble our efforts to promote the peace process.
Only thus can the humanitarian situation in the country
be alleviated. The Angolan Government has many
times expressed its readiness and willingness to
achieve national reconciliation and peace.

It is regrettable that the armed faction led by
Savimbi has continued its violent activities, thus
sabotaging the peace process in Angola. This is
unacceptable. It is necessary for the international
community to exert pressure on UNITA. We appeal to
Savimbi and the armed faction under his leadership to
respond to the Angolan Government's peace initiative
by laying down their arms and starting peace
negotiations with the Government as soon as possible.

The Chinese delegation supports the efforts of the
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
and other international relief organizations. We also
support the efforts of Ambassador Gambari, Special
Representative of the Secretary-General. For our part,
we will also work for the peace process in Angola.
