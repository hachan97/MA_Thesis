The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
decision taken on 26 October 2004 by resolution 1569
(2004).

At the outset, let me say what I think should be
obvious: that this is a highly unusual meeting of the
Security Council. Since 1952, when the Security
Council and the United Nations as a whole were
housed in New York, the Council has met outside of
New York City only three times. This is a
demonstration of the very strong interest of the
Security Council in the situation in the Sudan and its
commitment to the future of that country, as well as an
expression by the Council of the fact that we are there
not only today but on into the future to do what we can
to ensure that the Sudan has a strong and viable future.

On behalf of the members of the Council, I am
pleased to acknowledge the presence of His Excellency
The Honourable Mwai Kibaki, President of the
Republic of Kenya, where the Security Council is
meeting. I wish to thank his Government for the
generous support and assistance in making our
meetings a success.

I now have the honour to give the floor to
President Kibaki.
