Mr. Ouane (Mali) (spoke in French): My
delegation takes note with satisfaction of the report of
the Secretary-General of 22 May 2000, document
S/2000/461. That report indicates that implementation
of the United Nations settlement plan with a view to
holding a referendum on self-determination in Western
Sahara has been hampered for the past nine years
because of fundamental differences between the parties
with respect to the interpretation of some of the main
provisions of the plan. There is every reason to believe
that the referendum cannot be held within the desired
time-frame.

In this connection, I wish to point out that Mali,
which has always supported efforts made by our
Organization through the United Nations Mission for
the Referendum in Western Sahara, remains convinced
that the settlement plan is the appropriate framework
for the organization and holding of a referendum on
self-determination for the people of Western Sahara.

Mali had hoped that the Council would arrive at a
text that took the concerns of all parties broadly into
account. We therefore regret that the efforts made have
not yielded this result. At this stage, I praise your
personal efforts, Sir, to arrive at a balanced text. My
delegation would have wished the draft resolution on
which the Council is about to vote to be a presidential
text reflecting the unanimous support of Council
members for the efforts of the Personal Envoy of the
Secretary-General. In the absence of consensus on the
fourth preambular paragraph and operative paragraph
1, my delegation cannot vote in favour of this text. We
will not, however, oppose its adoption. Accordingly,
my delegation will abstain in the voting.

In conclusion, I wish to reiterate my delegation's
full support for the efforts of the Special Envoy of the
Secretary-General.
