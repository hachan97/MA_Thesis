The President (spoke in French): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Ms. Louise Arbour,
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.

It is so decided.

I invite Ms. Arbour to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
following documents: S/2005/60, containing a letter
dated 31 January 2005 from the Secretary-General
addressed to the President of the Security Council
transmitting the report of the International Commission
of Inquiry on Darfur, and S/2005/68, containing the
report of the Secretary-General on the Sudan.

I should also like to draw the attention of the
members of the Council to letters dated 8 February
2005 and 23 January 2005 from the Sudan, which will
be issued as documents S/2005/77 and S/2005/80,
respectively.

I welcome the presence of the Secretary-General,
Mr. Kofi Annan, and invite him to take the floor.
