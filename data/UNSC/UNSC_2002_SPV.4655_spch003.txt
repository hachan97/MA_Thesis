The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the
Deputy President of South Africa, Mr. Jacob Zuma, for
his very comprehensive briefing, which included some
very good news and recounted some positive
developments.

Since we do not have a list of speakers, I would
invite Council members who wish to take the floor to
indicate their intention to the Secretariat now.

The first speaker will be Mr. Jean-Marc de la
Sabliere, Permanent Representative of France, whom I
would like to welcome very warmly. This is his first
official meeting with the Security Council, and if he
wishes to speak he may do so even in Spanish.
