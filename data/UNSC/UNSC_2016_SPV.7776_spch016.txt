Mr. Bessho (Japan): The Comprehensive Nuclear-
Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is an important pillar of the
nuclear-disarmament regime. Japan is playing a leading
role as a co-facilitator of the early entry into force of
the CTBT.

Japan welcomes the adoption of resolution 2310
(2016), which calls upon all States to refrain from
conducting any nuclear tests. We believe that this will
boost momentum towards nuclear disarmament as well
as the early entry into force of the Treaty.

This resolution clearly demonstrates the collective
desire of the international community to promote the
nuclear-test ban. Japan appreciates the leadership of
the United States on this resolution and is happy to be
a sponsor.

North Korea has conducted its second nuclear
test in a single year. These nuclear tests by North
Korea are flagrant and unacceptable violations of
the relevant Security Council resolutions, including
resolution 2270 (2016), and pose a serious challenge to
the global disarmament and non-proliferation regimes.
Japan strongly condemns the tests by North Korea
and continues to demand that North Korea stop these
provocations and immediately comply with the relevant
Security Council resolutions.

The Security Council has already agreed to begin
work immediately on appropriate measures, under
Article 41 of the Charter of the United Nations, for a
Security Council draft resolution. Japan looks forward
to closely working with other Council members to that
end.

In conclusion, Japan reiterates its commitment to
working with the relevant countries on the early entry
into force of the CTBT.
