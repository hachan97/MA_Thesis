Mr. Yao Shaojun (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
would first like to congratulate you, Madam President,
on your assumption of the presidency of the Security
Council in September. We know this is a difficult

month and we wish you luck. We also thank the United
Kingdom for presiding over the Council in August.

China is of the View that the situation in Nicaragua
does not constitute a threat to international peace and
security. We support the position of Bolivia and Russia
and do not believe that it is necessary for the Security
Council to get involved.
