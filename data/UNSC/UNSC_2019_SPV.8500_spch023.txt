The President: There are no more names inscribed
on the list of speakers. I would now like to add some
concluding remarks.

I believe that today's exchange clearly testified
to the relevance of the topic, and I heard many if not
all members of the Security Council express strong
support for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and its commitments. There
are tangible concerns with regard to the challenges that
burden the NPT today, but I sense a willingness in the
Council to jointly assume responsibility for the future
of the Treaty and for advancing its objectives beyond
2020. This meeting has also contributed to fostering
a better understanding of the different views and
priorities related to the issue within the Security Council
membership, and should help us to find the right way
forward towards a successful Review Conference. I
thank all Council Members for their support in holding
today's meeting and for their active participation.

The meeting rose at12.30p.m.
