Mrs. Sucuoglu (Turkey): We feel obligated to take
the floor once more as we are astonished by the baseless
allegations, made by the Syrian regime's representative,
of organ trafficking related to Turkey. The organs
that he mentioned sadly belong to the Syrian children
indiscriminately killed by the regime. The operations
he mentioned are conducted in cooperation with the
United Nations to save those children who are seriously
injured. We just want to set the facts straight.

Just today the press reported that 30,000 Syrian
children have been born in safety in Turkey. Turkey's
opening of its doors to Syrians escaping conflict not
only saves the lives of men, women and children, but
also inspires hope for the future of Syria through those
newborns.
