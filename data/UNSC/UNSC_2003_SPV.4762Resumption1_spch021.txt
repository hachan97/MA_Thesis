The President: With the concurrence of the
members of the Security Council, and in accordance
with rule 39 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure, I intend to give the floor to Mr. Kenzo
Oshima, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian
Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator.

As I hear no objection, it is so decided.
I invite Mr. Oshima to take a seat at the Council
table.

I thank Mr. Oshima for his participation, and give
him the floor.
