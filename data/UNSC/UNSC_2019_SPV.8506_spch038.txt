Mr. Stein: I will refer to only two points.

First, with respect to the legitimacy of the
data, we carefully picked our data based on the
immigration data of legal crossings at Government
border installations of the migration authorities of the
receiving countries, and, of course, the hardest hit has
been Colombian territory. But if we were to include
the various video recordings of irregular footpaths,
blind trails or unofficial border points, which are used
on a daily basis by different numbers of unrecorded
Venezuelans crossing irregularly, the numbers would
go well above the mark of 4 million. As those present
know, irregularity increases vulnerability. But we
have chosen not to include those irregular numbers of
blind crossings.

Secondly, with all due respect, I would like to
set the record straight about what was said by the
representative of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
in the Security Council today. I was officially invited
by his Administration last year, and on 16 November I
personally met with Foreign Minister Arreaza. I never
ever resisted or gave any indication of not being willing
to accept the invitation to go to Caracas. The only
request I made was for an agenda of the Visit, in other
words, the reason they were inviting me. Insofar as I
must remind the members of the Security Council, our
mandate is basically humanitarian, to attend to those
people who have left Venezuelan territory. But, in any
case, Foreign Minister Arreaza agreed that they would
send a proposed agenda for my visit, for which I am
still waiting.
