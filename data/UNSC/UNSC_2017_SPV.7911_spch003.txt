Mr. Aboulatta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): My
country voted in favour of draft resolution 2349 (2017)
following extensive negotiations between the African
members of the Council and the countries of the Lake
Chad basin. Following these negotiations, substantive
amendments were made to the draft, which resulted in
a text that is in line with the purposes and goals of the
Council's visit to the region earlier this month.

The resolution stresses the sovereignty of these
States while remaining within the bounds of the
mandate of the Council under the Charter of the United
Nations. The resolution also expresses the Council's
solidarity with the countries of the region in their
efforts to combat the terrorist Boko Haram movement
despite their limited capacity, the complex military
environment and the gravity of the humanitarian crisis
in the region.

Negotiations on the draft resolution on the Lake
Chad basin have shown the imperative to improve the
working methods of the Council, especially in the area
of consulting on its draft resolutions. We stress once
again the need to uphold the principles of transparency
and of the full and effective participation of all members
of the Council, whether permanent or non-permanent,
in such negotiations, notably the African members of
the Council, in discussions on issues related to the
African continent.

The Council must maintain channels of serious,
effective and transparent communication with all
of the countries concerned by any draft resolution
under negotiation, in order to take into consideration
their opinions, concerns and proposals, in order to
strengthen the credibility of the Council, to prevent
any unacceptable interference in the internal affairs
of Members of the United Nations and to address the
realities on the ground.
