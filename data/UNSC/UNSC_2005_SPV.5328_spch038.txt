The President: I think we have had a very useful
debate. On behalf of the Council I would like to thank
again Presidents Pocar and Mose and Prosecutors Del
Ponte and Jallow. I think it is fair to say that the
members of the Council have encouraged both
Tribunals to consider pursuing their completion
strategies vigorously. I think they heard that in no
uncertain terms today.

It is clear, to all Council members that the
transfer of Ante Gotovina to the International Criminal
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) is a very
significant step. There is a continuing need for full
cooperation by States in the region to ensure the
transfer of the remaining indictees, including Karadzic
and Mladic to the ICTY and Kabuga to the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR).

The transfer of cases from the Tribunals to the
national jurisdictions was a point mentioned by many
speakers and is an essential element in the completion
strategies. But of course it needs to take place in the
context of capacity-building with those jurisdictions,
and with full respect for the human rights of the
indictees.

President Pocar mentioned the issue of the
consolidation of cases before the ICTY and the need to
ensure fair procedures. I believe that is an issue that
could be taken up by the Security Council's working
group on tribunals. If he is able to return to New York,
perhaps in January the current presidency of the
Security Council would be happy to explore with the
incoming presidency, Tanzania, whether they might
consider holding such a meeting under their
presidency.

May I again thank our four visitors, Judge Pocar,
Judge Mose, Prosecutor Del Ponte and Prosecutor
Jallow, for taking the time to brief the Security
Council.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 1.55 pm.
