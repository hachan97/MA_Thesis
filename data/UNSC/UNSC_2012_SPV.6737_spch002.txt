Mr. Osorio (Colombia): I have the honour to
present the 90-day report of the Committee established
pursuant to resolution 1737 (2006), in accordance with
paragraph 18 (h) of the same resolution. The report
covers the period from 21 December 2011 to 20 March
2012.

During the reporting period, the Committee held
one informal consultation, on 29 February 2012. The
Committee also continued to perform its duties through
informal contacts and exchanges and the no-objection
procedure envisioned by paragraph 15 of the guidelines
for the conduct of its work.

During the informal consultations of 29 February,
the Coordinator of the Panel of Experts briefed the
Committee on the Panel's activities since December
2011. The Panel conducted Visits and held a series of
consultations, listed in the annex, and submitted three
reports regarding reported incidents, as well as a fourth
quarterly assessment of Member States'
implementation reports. Committee members
exchanged views on a number of issues, including on
the three reports submitted by the Panel, the
publication of the Panel's 2011 final report, the need
for an effective and diligent response of the Committee
to sanctions violations, and the open briefing of the
Chair to be held soon, with the participation of the
Panel.

Some Member States expressed concern
regarding the illicit transfers of arms between Iran and
2

Syria, documented by the reports notified to the
Committee. A Member State drew the attention of the
Committee to a public statement of the Secretary-
General of Hizbullah dated 7 February, in which he
acknowledged that his movement had received material
support in all possible and available forms from Iran
since 1982, while recognizing that in the past his
movement had remained silent when asked about
financial and military support.

With respect to the implementation assistance
notices previously drafted by the Panel at the request
of the Committee, some Committee members
expressed hope that the notices could be soon finalized.
A Member State raised the issue of the Panel's travel
arrangements. Members also heard a briefing from the
delegation of France on the similarities between
ballistic and space technologies.

During the reporting period, the Committee
continued its consideration of the draft annual report
for 2011.

During the reporting period, the Committee
received a communication about a reported Violation of
paragraph 5 of resolution 1747 (2007), which imposes
a ban on the export and procurement of all arms and
related materiel from the Islamic Republic of Iran. In a
note verbale dated 9 January 2012, a Member State
provided information on the results of inspections
carried out on material confiscated from a truck on
15 February 2011 at a border gate with Syria.

In a letter dated 28 February 2012, four Member
States submitted a report regarding a violation of
paragraph 9 of resolution 1929 (2010) on the launch of
the Navid satellite into space using Iran's Safir space
launch vehicle as announced by Iran on 3 February
2012.

In a letter dated 22 February, a Member State
provided information on interdictions of three
consignments. The Committee also received a letter
dated 3 January from a Member State, providing
information on the inspection of the Panel of Experts in
that State on 18 and 19 November 2011 regarding a
previously reported incident.

On 27 December 2011, the Committee received a
note verbale from a Member State containing a
notification with reference to paragraph 5 of resolution
1737 (2006) concerning the transfer to Iran of items
12-27140
"intended for nuclear power plants with a light-water
reactor".

The Committee also received a note verbale dated
1 March 2012 from a Member State transmitting a
notification in accordance with paragraph 15 of
resolution 1737 (2006) and paragraph 4 of resolution
1747 (2007).

Furthermore, the Committee received from a
Member State a note verbale dated 22 February 2012,
indicating that its citizens and residents, as well as
entities based in that Member State, should address
their de-listing requests to the Committee directly
through the focal points.

The Committee also received a letter dated
6 March in which a Member State proposed, in
accordance with paragraph 26 of resolution 1929
(2010), the designation of two Iranian individuals and
an Iranian entity identified following a Violation
previously reported to the Committee.

On 6 March 2012, responding to a query from the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies, the Committee sent a letter
providing clarifications regarding the sanctions regime
imposed on Iran under resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747
(2007), 1803 (2008) and 1929 (2010) and humanitarian
activities.

On 30 January 2012, the Committee responded to
the note verbale dated 9 January 2012, which reported
a violation of paragraph 5 of resolution 1747 (2007), as
I referred to earlier.

The Committee continued its consideration of a
reported inspection and seizure, on 28 August 2010, of
a container onboard the vessel MS Finland, with a view
to sending letters to six Member States.

In relation to the issue of national
implementation, I would like to note that on 30 January
2012, the Panel of Experts transmitted to the
Committee, in accordance with paragraph 1 (b) (i) of
the Committee's work programme, a quarterly
assessment of the implementation reports submitted by
Member States pursuant of paragraph 31 of resolution
1929 (2010), for the period from 1 November 2011 to
31 January 2012.

On the same issue, I am happy to note that during
the reporting period the Committee received
communications from Turkmenistan and Armenia
12-27140

transmitting their respective reports on the
implementation of resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747
(2007), 1803 (2008) and 1929 (2010).

That concludes my report on the work of the
Committee.
