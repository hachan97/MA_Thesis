Mr. Nangaa Yobeluo (spoke in French): It should
be noted that the elections took place at 72,000 polling
stations. Each polling station opened in the morning,
at 6 a.m., and closed 11 hours later, at 5 pm. Once
the voting was closed, the polling stations turned into
counting stations. The manual counting was carried
out and other results were also available because of the
voting machines. After the counting, the law requires
that the results be posted. That is the first level of
publishing the results.

Each polling station was able to post the results.
But we must be careful, because when we publish the
results in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, if a
candidate senses that they are not good enough, his or
partisans may often tear up the posted sheets. Those
results, however, are the voting records. The district
sends the voting records and result sheets to the central
level via the local compilation centres.

In this case, since we are interested in the
presidential election, the corresponding constituency
is national territory. The results therefore are not
posted in a specific territory or district. The posting
or publication of the results of the presidential election
is done at the national level, which is what we mean by
national consolidation, because the constituency is the
national territory. That said, the results that were posted
at the polling stations are what we have. Some are sent
to the various courts and others to the Commission
electorale nationale independante.

They say that people will challenge the results.
We will, of course, forward to the courts the evidence
at our disposal that led us to whatever the results are.
As we have said, we will provide those results to the
Constitutional Court, especially since the law does
not stipulate that we must give them to the Conference
episcopale nationale du Congo or other organizations.
Those results will be presented to the Constitutional
Court if they are disputed. That is how that works.
