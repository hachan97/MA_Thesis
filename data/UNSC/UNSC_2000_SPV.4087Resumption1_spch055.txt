The President: I thank the representative of New
Zealand for his kind words about this meeting.

The next speaker is the representative of Zambia. I
invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make
his statement. May I say how much we are looking forward
to the arrival in New York, in less than two weeks, of his
President to join us in this historic set of meetings on
Africa.
