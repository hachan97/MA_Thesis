Mr. Alemu (Ethiopia): We would like to explain
why we abstained in the voting on the draft resolution
proposed by Russia (S/2018/355). We abstained not
because the text does not contain a great deal of
truth - indeed it does - or because it does not adhere
to principles to which we should all adhere; it does. We
abstained on the grounds of pragmatism. We know that
even if it had received nine votes, it would have been
vetoed. Therefore it would have had only symbolic
value. Nonetheless, that is not unimportant. However,
for us, it is critical to defuse tensions and prevent the
situation from spiralling out of control. We would like
to play a constructive role in that regard.
