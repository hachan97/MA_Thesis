Mr. Pankin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian):
The statement made today by the representative of
Georgia was most unfortunate. Such attacks on my
country call into question the solidity of the current
Georgian leadership and its desire to normalize
relations with Russia. If we desire stable peace, as has
been said today by a number of delegations, we must
recognize the new geopolitical realities in the Caucasus
and the emergence of the two sovereign, independent
States of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. They must be
engaged in dialogue on equal footing in order to ensure
stability and prosperity in the region.
