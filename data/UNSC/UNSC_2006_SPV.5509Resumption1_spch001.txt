The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Liberia, Niger and Pakistan in which
they request to be invited to participate in the
consideration of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the discussion, without the right to
vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, the
representatives of the aforementioned countries
took the seats reserved for them at the side of the
Council Chamber.

I wish to remind all speakers, as I indicated at the
morning session, to limit their statements to no more
than four minutes in order to enable the Council to
carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with
lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate the
text in writing and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking in the Chamber.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Guatemala, to whom I give the floor.
