The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2001/188, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of the members
of the Council to the following documents: S/2001/166
and S/2001/176, letters dated 23 and 27 February 2001,
respectively, from Sierra Leone; S/2001/167, letter
dated 23 February 2001, from Liberia; and S/2001/173,
letter dated 26 February 2001 from Guinea.

Today the Security Council will adopt the draft
resolution which is contained in document S/2001/188.
This draft resolution flows from previous discussions
of the Council, including during the meeting with an
Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) ministerial delegation on 12 February
2001.

is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/2001/188) before it. Unless I hear any objection, I
shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
