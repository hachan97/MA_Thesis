Ms. Sison (United States of America): I welcome
the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Colombia back to
the Chamber. We welcome this morning's unanimous
adoption of resolution 2366 (2017).

Last year, we witnessed the entry into force of the
Final Agreement for Ending the Conflict and Building
a Stable and Lasting Peace. The accord represents
a historic agreement that paves the way for lasting
peace for the Colombian people. We commend the
parties for their determination to persevere through the
implementation of the Peace Agreement. With the near
completion of the disarmament process, we now enter a
critical next stage.

The Security Council has recognized that the
successful reintegration of ex-combatants and
expanding the reach of the Colombian Government
to remote areas of the country are both necessary to
ensure the long-term success of the peace process.

Our own ongoing assistance to Colombia will
focus on, among other things, security, including the
Colombian Government's counter-narcotics efforts, as
well as its support for the reintegration of ex-combatants,
expansion of State institutions and presence in former
rebel areas, including rural economic development,
justice services, the military's civil engineering units,
and humanitarian demining.

We recognize that the road ahead will pose
challenges, but I assure you that the United States is fully
committed to the implementation of the peace accord
and to the promotion of security, justice, prosperity,
and respect for human rights for all Colombians.
