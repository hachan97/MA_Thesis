Mr. Hill (Australia): Thank you, Mr. President,
for the opportunity to contribute briefly to this very
important debate. Australia has been deeply disturbed
by the continuing violence in Gaza and southern Israel.
The escalation of the conflict underlines the urgency of
diplomatic efforts to find a resolution. Australia
supports the actions of the United Nations in seeking to
bring about an immediate ceasefire.

Australia continues to believe that a resolution to
the current situation must bring a halt to rocket attacks
against Israel by Hamas, an end to arms shipments into
the Gaza Strip and the opening of the border crossings
into the Gaza Strip. Furthermore, any diplomatic
solution must form part of a longer-term compact
involving Israel and Palestine, based on a two-State
solution to the Israel-Palestinian issue. Australia
welcomes the active role of Egypt and France in
working towards a diplomatic resolution to the conflict.

Australia is gravely concerned by the
humanitarian implications of this conflict and notes
that its expansion also exacerbated what was already a
grave situation in the Gaza Strip. It is critical that
Israel meet its obligations under international
humanitarian law to the people of the Gaza Strip,
ensuring that they have access to basic goods, food,
medical supplies and humanitarian assistance.
Australia welcomes Israel's announcement that it is
establishing improved conditions for aid to flow into
the Gaza Strip.

Australia has been a long-time provider of
assistance to the Palestinian people, doubling its
assistance in 2008 to $45 million. On 1 January of this
year Australia announced an immediate commitment of
$5 million in additional assistance to the people of the
Gaza Strip. This assistance will go towards providing
emergency food and medical supplies, as well as cash
assistance to conflict-affected families. Australia stands
ready to provide further assistance as required.
