Mr. Loulichki (Morocco) (spoke in French): I
shall be very brief. Earlier, a delegation thought it was
a good idea to refer to a situation that has absolutely
nothing to do with today's debate. It made comparisons
that are as baseless as they are inopportune. I intend
neither to follow nor to entertain that attempt to disrupt
our debate, much less to detract from the positive
message of support and encouragement that we hope
will emerge from this high-level meeting. That is our
goal and should be the goal of all delegations. I would
like each and every one of them to adhere to that
premise and to contribute in a positive manner.
