Mr. Valle (Brazil): My delegation voted in favour
of the draft resolution, first, because we are in general
agreement with the provisions contained therein and,
secondly, because our positive vote should be
interpreted as a demonstration of support for the
Secretary-General's efforts towards a solution to the
question of Cyprus. However, we still have doubts with
relation to the timing of the initiative and would have
appreciated the allotment of more time for
consultations.
