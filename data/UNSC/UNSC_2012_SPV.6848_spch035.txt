Mr. Mahiga: I would like to express my
appreciation to the members of the Council and to the
speakers from other Member States who were invited
for their kind words to me, the United Nations Political
Office for Somalia and my colleagues in the United
Nations. I also want to thank the members of the
Council for their support and promises of continuing
support to the African Union Mission in Somalia and
the new Government of Somalia. We are encouraged by
those sentiments and, in the coming strategic review,
we hope we will be faithfully able to present options
to the Council that will define the next mandate of our
respective institutions.
