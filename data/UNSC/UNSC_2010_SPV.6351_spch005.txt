The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Ambassador Apakan for his briefing. On behalf of the
Council, I should like to express appreciation to all the
members of the Security Council and the Secretariat
who participated in the mission, which was very ably
led by Ambassador Apakan, for the manner in which
they discharged their important responsibilities on
behalf of the Council.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Afghanistan.
