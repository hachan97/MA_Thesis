Mr. Cunningham (United States of America): I
will keep my remarks very brief, because I think the
report of the Council mission basically says it all. As
Under-Secretary-General Guehenno noted in his
comments, the mission sent clear messages to its
interlocutors. In my view, and in the view of my
authorities, it was very useful. I want to commend you
also, Mr. President, on your leadership and your effort
to get so much into such a short period of time. It really
was quite useful. It was particularly useful, I think, that
we had the occasion to meet with Presidents Putin and
Kostunica during the visit, because it I think it helped
all of us understand better the context that we are
working in.

I just wanted to emphasize a couple of key points
from the United States point of view. We strongly
support the efforts of Mr. Haekkerup and the United
Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo
(UNMIK), including on the importance of moving to
elections and improving security in the region. It was
very clear that they have ambitious plans in that regard,
and we support that wholeheartedly.

I also want to repeat, very simply, that the United
States, as we go through this process, will support all
those who favour dialogue in the political process and
will oppose those who continue to incite violence, and
we condemn violence from whatever quarter it comes.
