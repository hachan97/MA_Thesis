Mr. Rosselli (Uruguay): Uruguay voted in favour
of resolution 2350 (2017) on the basis of our belief that
this is the best way to support the continued transition
going forward in Haiti.

The new United Nations Mission for Justice
Support in Haiti will focus on three key areas: the
rule of law, security and human rights. With the
extension of the current mandate of the United Nations
Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) until
October, we will be able to draw to a close a very
successful United Nations peacekeeping operation.
For the past 13 years and under the leadership Brazil,
MINUSTAH has played an intense role in difficult
circumstances - complicated at the outset by natural
factors, such as the earthquake of 2010 and last year's
hurricane - and has always fulfilled its functions. We
also underscore the importance of the new Mission's
ongoing cooperation and assistance so that Haiti can
achieve sustainable development.

We also reiterate our congratulations and best
wishes to the people and the Government of Haiti,
which Uruguay, as a friendly country, has supported
throughout every stage. We reiterate our support for
Brazil and the work of Ms. Sandra Honore, as well as to
all the men and women who have participated and will
continue to participate in MINUSTAH as it completes
his mandate professionally and responsibly.

At the same time, we are grateful for all the
cooperation we have enjoyed from the Group of Friends
of Haiti throughout the years. I would like to make it
clear that in the negotiation process of the resolution,
the Group of Friends worked strenuously, as usual, to
submit to the Security Council a resolution that enjoyed
consensus. However, at the end of the negotiating
process within the Group of Friends, language was was
introduced into the resolution that had not previously
been discussed and that, in the view of many, did
not do justice to the outstanding work performed by
MINUSTAH for all these years.
