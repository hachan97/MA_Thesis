The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now
make a short statement - I am sure it will be the
last - on the way in which Bolivia is presiding over
the Security Council.

We agree that States must keep their remarks
within the framework of the agenda for which a meeting
is convened. Unfortunately, in many cases, that is not
happening, and I could cite several examples. When we
talk about the question of Palestine, some States talk
about other matters. However, for this presidency, all
Member States are on the same footing. This presidency
will never cut off any State while it is speaking because
we believe that the State knows what it is talking about
and has every right to express itself with the utmost
freedom in the Security Council. As long as we are
presiding over the Security Council, therefore, that is
how we will conduct ourselves.

The meeting rose at 12:30pm.
