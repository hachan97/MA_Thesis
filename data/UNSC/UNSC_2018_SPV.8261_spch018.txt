Mr. Zhang Dianbin (China) (spoke in Chinese):
The Chinese delegation would like to thank Assistant
Secretary-General Mr. Taye-Brook Zerihoun,
Mr. Fedotov and Ambassador Vieira for their briefings.

China commends the recent progress in the
political process in Guinea-Bissau and the start of
the implementation of the Conakry Agreement by the
various parties in the country. Regional and subregional
organizations, such as the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS), the European Union
and the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries
(CPLP), played an important role in mediation and good
offices in resolving the political crisis in Guinea-Bissau,
which China appreciates. China calls on international
donors and partners to provide bilateral and multilateral
cooperation so as to continue to support the country in
its efforts to strengthen State capacity and to improve
the lives of its people.

We hope that the United Nations country team,
the Peacebuilding Commission, the United Nations
Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau
(UNIOGBIS), the United Nations Development
Programme and the United Nations Office on Drugs
and Crime will provide targeted assistance to the
country, given its needs.

China supports African countries in providing
African solutions to African problems. They should
work alongside the international community, including
ECOWAS, together with UNIOGBIS and the new
Special Representative of the Secretary-General for
Guinea-Bissau, Mr. Filho, in order to promote dialogue
and communication among the various stakeholders
in Guinea-Bissua, to preserve stability and lasting
development in Guinea-Bissau and West Africa and to
play a constructive role in that regard.
