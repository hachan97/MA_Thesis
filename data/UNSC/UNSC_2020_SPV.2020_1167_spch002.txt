Belgium commends the work undertaken by the South African delegation in its efforts to promote security sector reform. Security sector reform is an important topic that merits a thorough and exhaustive discussion among Security Council members, within an appropriate time frame. Belgium wants to reiterate that fully inclusive and gender-sensitive security sector reform processes, taking into account all segments of society and taking into account women and youth, are a conditio sine qua non for sustainable peace. Belgium also wants to reiterate that security sector reform plays a crucial role in all phases of conflict, from conflict prevention to peacebuilding. Adequate, predictable and sustainable funding and thorough coordination of all security sector reform activities are key to deliver an efficient and effective security sector reform.
