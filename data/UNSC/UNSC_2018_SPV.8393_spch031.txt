Mr. Abdounasir (spoke in French): On behalf of
our colleagues, I would like to say that we are very
grateful for the recognition expressed for our efforts.

I would first like to speak about the French-speaking
world and the units serving from it, particularly in the
United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO).
As has just been said, it is our desire to have more
women and francophone staff members, failing which
we have created mechanisms to improve the linguistic
abilities of personnel on the ground and recruited
language experts for the formed police units in order to
communicate with the communities.

I also take this opportunity to respond to the concerns
expressed by the Ambassador of the Netherlands with
respect to the issue of organized crime. Much has been
done but much remains to be done. I thank the Police
Division for helping us to establish specialized teams
on ground with all due speed. That is most important.

I conclude by addressing the concern expressed by
the Ambassador of the United States with regard to the
elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The
size of the MONUSCO police contingent is less than
1 per cent that of the Congolese National Police. While
we have many challenges ahead, that is not preventing
us from preparing and drafting emergency plans in
order to deploy to spots where we can be useful and
make a difference.
