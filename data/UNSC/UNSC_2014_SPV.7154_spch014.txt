Mr. Oh Joon (Republic ofKorea): Ithank Assistant
Secretary-General Oscar Fernandez-Taranco for his
briefing.

The Republic of Korea is closely watching the
recent developments in the eastern part of Ukraine. We
are deeply concerned over the escalation of tensions
in various cities of eastern Ukraine, including the
worrying seizure of key public buildings in Donetsk
and Slovyansk by force. Those actions will only further
exacerbate the already tense situation, and we condemn
any use of force to change the situation on the ground.

As Ukraine moves towards critical elections in May,
we believe that political differences must be addressed
in a non-violent way through a legitimate process.
United Nations States Members should respect that
process, and there should not be any influence exerted
by outside forces. We reiterate our strong support for
the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence
of Ukraine.
