The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

In a letter dated 20 June 2002 addressed to the
Secretary-General, the President and the Chancellor of
the Swiss Confederation submitted the application of
their country for membership in the United Nations.
That letter has been circulated in document
S/2002/801.

Under the provisions of rule 59 of the provisional
rules of procedure of the Security Council, unless the
Council decides otherwise, an application for
membership shall be referred by the President of the
Council to the Committee on the Admission of New
Members. Accordingly, unless I hear a proposal to the
contrary, I shall refer the application of the Swiss
Confederation to the Committee on the Admission of
New Members for examination and report.

As I hear no objection, it is so decided.

I would propose that the Committee on the
Admission of New Members meet at 11 o'clock this
morning, in Conference Room 7, to consider the
application of the Swiss Confederation for membership
in the United Nations.

The meeting rose at 10.45 a.m.
