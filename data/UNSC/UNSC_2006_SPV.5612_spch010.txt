Mr. Mayoral (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): At
the outset, I should like to state that Argentina voted in
favour of resolution 1737 (2006), just adopted, because
the resolution reaffirms the inalienable right enjoyed
by all States parties to the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons under articles I and
II of the Treaty to develop, research, produce and use
nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without
discrimination.

At the same time, on behalf of my Government, I
express our confidence that the Government of Iran
will in the future pursue its nuclear programme
exclusively for peaceful purposes, following the
parameters established by the International Atomic
Energy Agency and the relevant resolutions of the
Security Council. Moreover, on a different point, we
note our satisfaction that the resolution was adopted
unanimously and under article 41 of the United Nations
Charter. In other words, there is no possibility under
resolution 1737 (2006) of recourse to the use of force.

We would point out that the peaceful settlement
of international conflicts should be the United Nations
main objective. To that end, its principal aim should be
to maintain international peace and security, and that is
Argentina's understanding in this instance. We
therefore issue a new call to all parties involved to
resume dialogue in order to find a diplomatic solution
to the Iranian nuclear issue.
