The President (spoke in French): I am of course
in agreement with the analysis of the question just
presented by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of
Luxembourg. I think we need a comprehensive
approach, as he said. I would especially like to welcome
his role in combating poverty through the actions that
he indicated and encourage him to pursue that effort
because the road is still long.
