Mr. Zhao Yong (China) (spoke in Chinese): I wish
to thank Ms. Bensouda for her briefing.

China has been closely watching the developments
in Libya. The fundamental way to resolve the Libyan
issue lies in political dialogue, and any settlement
should respect the will and choice of the Libyan people
and maintain the sovereignty, independence and
territorial integrity of the country.

China hopes that the parties concerned in Libya
will prioritize the interests of the Libyan nation and
its people, seize the opportunity presented, value the
results of dialogue already achieved and continue
to engage in negotiation and consultation to ease
differences, with a view to reaching an early political
agreement to establish a Government of national accord
and restoring national security and stability. That is
the prerequisite and foundation for the realization of
judicial justice in Libya.

China's position with regard to international
judicial institutions remains unchanged.
