Lieutenant General Dos Santos Cruz: I apologize
for failing to have touched upon the points raised by the
representative of Rwanda. I have profound personal and
professional respect and consideration for him, and am
sorry I overlooked his question.

With regard to the question of Kota Koli, there
are three camps for ex-combatants in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, one of which is Kota Koli.
Human Rights Watch released a report on the camp,
because more than 100 people died there during the
time it was operating. The camp is not a military camp
under the control of the United Nations Organization
Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (MONUSCO). Rather, it is administered
by the Government of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo as part of its disarmament, demobilization
and reintegration programme. The report was very
sad, because it may lead to a decrease in the number
of surrenders of ex-combatants, which we want, on the
contrary, to encourage.

The Special Representative of the Secretary-
General visited MONUSCO before the problem arose.
Now MONUSCO is there with a task force to support
and help the Government, because, although the camp
is not being administered by MONUSCO, we are
committed to giving the maximum support in order not
to have this kind of problem in future, because it is a
problem that could endanger the entire process when
we prompt the ex-combatants to surrender. That is the
point we are at.

The Special Representative of the Secretary-
General is personally committed, along with the United
Nations country team and the Mission, to supporting
the Congolese Government.
