The Secretary-General: By the adoption of this
resolution, the Security Council has taken an important
step and has demonstrated its continued support for the
transitional process in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo. The Council's decision to expand the strength
of the United Nations Organization Mission in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) by an
additional 5,900 military and civilian police personnel
will contribute to improving the Mission's operational
capacities, which are severely under-resourced at the
moment.

I must remind the Council, however, that the
newly approved ceiling of 16,700 in total falls well
below the figure of 23,900 troops and 507 civilian
police personnel that I recommended in my report to
the Council (S/2004/650) of 16 August 2004. In view
of that reduction, MONUC will have to review the
scope of the support it can provide for the peace
process, as my original recommendations were made
on the basis of different assumptions.

I have therefore instructed the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations to review the tasks that can
be performed by MONUC within the new ceiling with
a view to revising the scope of its military and civilian
police concepts of operation.

I continue to believe that the total military and
police strength recommended in my third special report
is the minimum required to effectively meet the current
challenges in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It
is for that reason that I welcome the Council's
intention to keep MONUC's strength and structure
under regular review, and I sincerely hope that the
Council will favourably revisit the issue of MONUC'S
requirements in the future.
