Mr. Okamura (Japan): I am very encouraged,
Mr. President, by your suggestion that we should be
more active and action oriented. I would just like to add
one very brief comment.

I participated in the mission and was very
encouraged by the sense of ownership from the
regional countries of Cameroon, Chad, the Niger and
Nigeria. They are very determined to deal with the
Boko Haram issue, and the Presidents have very clear
views on the situation, on the causes and priority tasks
to address that issue. The African countries themselves
are seeking solutions to their own problems. Regional
groups such as the Multinational Joint Task Force, the
Lake Chad Basin Commission, the Group ofFive Sahel,
the Economic Community of West African States and
the Economic Community of Central African States are
making joint efforts to tackle the crisis.

Japan believes that assistance from the international
community has greater force and is more needed when
the country or the people on the ground themselves
make genuine efforts to solve their own problems. I
have the strong sense that the Boko Haram problem
and the humanitarian crisis should not be neglected.
Furthermore, the countries of the region have a keen
interest in this issue.

The meeting rose at 11.10 am.
