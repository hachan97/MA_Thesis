The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of
Rwanda, in which he requests to be invited to participate in
the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
accordance with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the discussion without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Mataboba
(Rwanda) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: In accordance with the understanding
reached in the Council's prior consultations, I shall take it
that the Security Council decides to extend an invitation
under rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure to
Ms. Carla Del Ponte, Prosecutor of the International
Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for
Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law
Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia and
of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons
Responsible for Serious Violations of International
Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda
and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Such Violations
Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States.

It is so decided.

I welcome Ms. Del Ponte and invite her to take a seat
at the Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by the Prosecutor of the International Tribunals
for the Former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda.

I now call on Ms. Carla Del Ponte, to whom the
Council has extended an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure, in order to brief the
Council.
