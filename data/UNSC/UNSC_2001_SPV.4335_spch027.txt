The President: I thank the representative of
Norway for his kind words addressed to me.

I will now yield and, instead of making a
statement in my national capacity, give the floor to the
countries that have been invited under rule 37. First on
that list is the representative of Sweden. I invite him to
take a seat at the Council table and to make his
statement.
