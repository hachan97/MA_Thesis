Mr. Koenigs: I have taken careful note of all the
very constructive remarks made today. They will give
UNAMA the necessary guidance for the next time.

I wish to make only three remarks. First, I would
like to thank the Council and all its members for the
continuous support for the Afghan people and the
democratically elected Afghan Government. UNAMA
will certainly continue to implement the mandate the
Council has given us. I am very grateful that the
members of the Council intend to extend the mandate
for another 12 months, strengthening UNAMA's role of
protecting civilians in armed conflict. Lastly, I have
taken note of the many very supportive and frank
remarks on the work of UNAMA and its staff. I will be
happy to convey that message to our nearly 300
international and 1,200 national staff.
