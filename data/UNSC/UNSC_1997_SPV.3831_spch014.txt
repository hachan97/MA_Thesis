The President (interpretation from Chinese): It is
my understanding that the Security Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution contained in
document S/1997/872. If I hear no objection, I shall put
the draft resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Chile, China, Costa Rica, Egypt, France, Guinea-
Bissau, Japan, Kenya, Poland, Portugal, Republic of
Korea, Russian Federation, Sweden, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America

The President (interpretation from Chinese): There
were 15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has

therefore been adopted unanimously as resolution 1137
(1997).

I shall now call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements following the voting.
