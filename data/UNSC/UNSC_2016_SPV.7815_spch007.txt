Mr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): We welcome the
unanimous adoption of resolution 2319 (2016),
which extends the mandate of the Joint Investigative
Mechanism for a one-year period.

Ukraine commends the Joint Investigative
Mechanism's efforts aimed at executing its mandate
based on the principles of impartiality, objectivity
and independence. Its conclusions have proved the
importance of having the Mechanism available in
the future, since there are still many cases, including
some that took place in 2016, that should be thoroughly
investigated. We are also deeply concerned with the
continuous allegations of possible illegal possession,
movement and intention to use toxic substances as
chemical weapons in Syria.

At the same time, the resolution envisages
additional tasks for the Joint Investigative Mechanism
in the future, in particular investigating the illegal
activity of non-State actors. We believe that this change
of focus for the Mechanism will not lead to overlooking
the primary part of its mandate pursuant to resolution
2235 (2015).

Removing the threat of any use of chemical
weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic is an essential
element in creating proper conditions for de-escalating
tensions on the ground, tackling extremism and
reaching a sustainable political solution to the crisis
in a broader context. The international community
must have full confidence that Syria has irreversibly
abandoned its chemical-weapons programme and
that those responsible for organizing and committing
horrible crimes using chemical weapons as a means of
warfare are held accountable.
