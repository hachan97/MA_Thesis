The President: Thank you, Mr. Egeland, not only
for that contribution, but for staying with us as long as
you have today. Given all your other pressing concerns,
that is particularly appreciated.

I now give the floor to Mr. Dominique Buff of the
International Committee of the Red Cross to make a
final comment.
