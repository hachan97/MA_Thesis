The President: I thank all four briefers for
taking our questions and responding with such useful
insights, so that together we can go on with our work
to continually improve United Nations peacekeeping. It
is clear that we have a healthy appetite for continuing
these discussions. We have not been able to fully answer
every question raised, but I hope that the conversations
will continue so that we can do so. I encourage the
Commissioners to continue to tell us exactly how they
feel, to tell us about their experiences in the field, on
the front lines and in the most vulnerable communities.

I would also like to thank my colleagues on the
Council for their comments and questions.

There are no more names inscribed on the list of
speakers.
