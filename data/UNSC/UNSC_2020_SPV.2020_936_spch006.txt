I thank Special Envoy Pedersen for his briefing on the recent political and military developments in Syria, as well as on the most recent Syrian Constitutional Committee session of meetings, which was held in Geneva last month. Like many other members of the Security Council, we are cautiously optimistic about the Turkish-Russian ceasefire agreement from March, which seems to be largely holding. We believe that six months of relative peace can pave the way for renewed dialogue between the Syrian opposition and authorities in Damascus. In the light of that, we also welcome the latest round of Constitutional Committee talks. We appreciate the fact that despite the challenges posed by the outbreak of the coronavirus disease, the parties are still engaged in the political process. We thank the Office of the Special Envoy for facilitating the dialogue between Syrian parties. The legitimate claims of the Syrian opposition must be taken into account when looking to the future and rebuilding Syria. Estonia believes that, in order to allow genuine exchange of ideas among parties to the conflict, the next important step is to make Constitutional Committee meetings regular. Delaying tactics of any sort cannot be accepted. Nevertheless, we wish to emphasize that, by itself, a new Constitution is not enough to solve Syria's problems. Releasing arbitrarily detained people, respect for human rights, and the holding of free and fair elections are the cornerstone of national reconciliation. Estonia and the European Union remain committed to finding a lasting and credible political solution to the conflict in Syria. Accordingly, we encourage all international actors to support the parties in achieving these aims, which are also implicit in the road map for peace set out in the resolution 2254 (2015) and the 2012 Geneva communique (S/2012/522, annex).
