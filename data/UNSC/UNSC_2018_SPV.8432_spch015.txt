Ms. Guadey (Ethiopia): We thank Under-Secretary-
General Jean-Pierre Lacroix for his briefing on the
developments in connection with tunnels along the
Blue Line. We have also taken note of the white notes
we received last week. We understand the seriousness
of the matter, which has enormous ramifications for the
security and stability of not only Lebanon and Israel,
but also of the wider region.

We all know the delicate situation in the region,
and it would not be in anyone's interest if it escalated.
That is why it is absolutely vital to maintain calm and
stability along the Blue Line. It is encouraging to know
that both parties are willing to work with the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and have
no intention to escalate the situation along the Blue line.

We take note of the statement issued by the UNIFIL
Head of Mission and Force Commander following
meetings with the Lebanese President and Speaker
of Parliament. The role of UNIFIL continues to be
very vital and the mission needs to be supported in
effectively carrying out its mandate. It is also important
that UNIFIL continue to work in close coordination
with the parties to verify the facts and address the
developments in connection with the tunnels, in line
with resolution 1701 (2006). We hope the Council will
be informed of the outcome of the investigations in
due course.

Finally, strengthening the presence of the Lebanese
Armed Forces throughout the territory remains an
important objective, which needs to be implemented.
That is all the more significant in the light of the most
recent developments. We support the efforts of the
Government of Lebanon to extend its authority across
the whole territory.
