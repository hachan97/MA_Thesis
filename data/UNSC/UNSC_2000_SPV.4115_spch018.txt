Mr. Annabi: There is not much to add. Perhaps I
could simply add that the Special Representative, together
with colleagues from the Department of Political Affairs,
met yesterday with President Rakhmonov to discuss the
follow-on presence of the United Nations in Tajikistan.
During those discussions, the President confirmed his
support for this follow-on presence.
The Secretary-General will now be preparing
recommendations and precise terms of reference for this
follow-on presence, which will be brought to the attention
of the Council in due course.
