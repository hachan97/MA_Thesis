The President (spoke in French): I would like to
thank His Majesty Mohammed VI and the Government
of Morocco for their effective response strategy. We
recall the attacks that we have all condemned, but I
do believe that the strategy has been implemented and
measures have been taken since then. For now, we can
affirm that terrorism has been vanquished in that area.
We also appreciate Morocco's willingness to cooperate
with other States and to share its experience in order to
enable them to combat terrorism.
