Mr. Plumbly (United Kingdom): We welcome the
adoption of this resolution, which successfully concludes
many months - indeed years - of work to devise and
agree to an export/import mechanism for Iraq, as requested
in Security Council resolution 715 (1991). The efforts of
the Special Commission, the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) and the Ambassador and delegation of
Germany, representing the chair of the sanctions
Committee, in achieving this goal are particularly
praiseworthy.

Recent reports from the Special Commission show that
continued vigilance is essential in respect of Iraqi attempts
to procure or produce weapons of mass destruction. The
export/import mechanism is an important tool in this
process: it will allow the Special Commission and the
IAEA to monitor dual-use items and technologies already
being imported into Iraq. This will have increased
significance if the discussions on implementing Security
Council resolution 986 (1995) are successful, since that
would lead to an increased flow of goods into Iraq.

We strongly believe that the 60-day deadline for
implementation of the mechanism by Iraq must be
scrupulously respected. We also very much hope that all
Member States will work intensively with the Special
Commission and the IAEA to bring the mechanism as a
whole into effect at the earliest possible date.
