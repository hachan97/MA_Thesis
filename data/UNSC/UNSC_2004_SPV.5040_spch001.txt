The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of the Sudan, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Erwa
(Sudan) took a seat at the Council table.

The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf Of
the Council, I welcome the presence at this meeting of
the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraphs
6 and 13 to 16 of Security Council 1556 (2004),
document S/2004/703.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2004/744, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Germany, Romania,
Spain, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and the United States of America.

I wish to draw the attention of the members of the
Council to document S/2004/739, containing the text of
a letter dated 16 September 2004 from the
representatives of Australia, Canada and New Zealand
addressed to the President of the Security Council.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote.
There being no objection it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements before the voting.
