The President (spoke in Spanish): Following
consultations among members of the Security Council,
I have been authorized to make the following statement
on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council takes note with
appreciation of the seventh report of the
Secretary-General (S/2007/757) on children and
armed conflict, and the positive developments, as
well as outstanding challenges, in the
implementation of its resolution 1612 (2005)
reflected therein.

"The Security Council, reiterating its
primary responsibility for the maintenance of
international peace and security, reaffirms its
commitment to address the widespread impact of
armed conflict on children, its determination to
ensure respect for and the implementation of its
resolution 1612 (2005), and all of its previous
resolutions on children and armed conflict, as
well as respect for other international norms and
standards for the protection of children affected
by armed conflicts.

"The Security Council stresses, in this
regard, the need to adopt a broad strategy of
conflict prevention, which addresses the root
causes of armed conflict in a comprehensive
manner in order to enhance the protection of
children on a long-term basis, including by
promoting sustainable development, poverty
eradication, national reconciliation, good
governance, democracy, the rule of law and
respect for and protection of human rights.

"The Security Council reiterates the primary
responsibility of national Governments in
providing effective protection and relief to all
children affected by armed conflicts, and
encourages further cooperation and coordination
between Member States, the United Nations
system and the international community, in a
spirit of partnership.

"The Security Council reiterates the
importance of the full, safe and unhindered
access of humanitarian personnel and goods and
the delivery of humanitarian assistance to all
children affected by armed conflict, and stresses
the importance for all, within the framework of
humanitarian assistance, of upholding and
respecting the humanitarian principles of
humanity, neutrality, impartiality and
independence.

"The Security Council calls for the full
implementation of the monitoring and reporting
mechanism on children and armed conflict, as
called for in paragraph 3 of Security Council
resolution 1612 (2005), in all situations of armed
conflict listed in the annexes to the Secretary-
General's report S/2007/757.

"In this regard, the Security Council
reiterates that the mechanism should continue to
collect and provide timely, objective, accurate
and reliable information on violations and abuses
committed against children affected by armed
conflict and to operate with the participation of
and in cooperation with national Governments
and relevant United Nations and civil society
actors, including at the country level.

"The Security Council commends the work
carried out by the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General for Children and Armed
Conflict, Ms. Radhika Coomaraswamy, including
her field activities in situations of armed
conflicts.

"The Security Council also commends the
work carried out by UNICEF and the child
protection advisers of peacekeeping operations
and political missions, in cooperation with other
relevant United Nations entities.

"The Security Council welcomes the
sustained activity of its Working Group on
Children and Armed Conflict, as outlined, inter
alia, in the latest report by its Chair (S/2007/428),
and invites it to continue adopting conclusions
and proposing effective recommendations for
consideration and, where appropriate,
implementation by the Council, including through
mandates of United Nations peacekeeping
operations and political missions.

"The Security Council will continue to
consider including or enhancing the presence of
child protection advisers in the mandates of all
relevant United Nations peacekeeping operations
and political missions.

"The Security Council strongly emphasizes
the need to end impunity for violations and
abuses perpetrated against children in armed
conflict, and in this regard welcomes the fact that
several individuals who are alleged to have
committed such crimes have been brought to
justice by national, international and 'mixed'
criminal courts and tribunals.

"The Security Council acknowledges that
the implementation of its resolution 1612 (2005)
has already generated progress, resulting in the
release and reintegration of children in their
families and communities, and in a more
systematic dialogue between the United Nations
country task forces and parties to the armed
conflict on the implementation of time-bound
action plans.

"Nonetheless, the Security Council strongly
condemns the continuing recruitment and use of
children in armed conflict in violation of
applicable international law, killing and maiming
of children, rape and other sexual violence,
abductions, denial of humanitarian access to
children and attacks against schools and hospitals
by parties to armed conflict.

"The Security Council is concerned with the
widespread and systematic use of rape and other
forms of sexual violence against children, in
particular girls, in situations of armed conflict,
and calls on all parties to armed conflicts to take
special measures to protect girls and boys from
sexual and gender-based violence, particularly
rape, in situations of armed conflict.

"The Security Council expresses its concern
that civilians, particularly children, continue to
account for the vast majority of victims of acts of
violence committed by parties to armed conflicts,
including killing and maiming as a result of
deliberate targeting, indiscriminate and excessive
use of force in violation of applicable
international law. The Council condemns these
acts and demands that those parties immediately
put an end to such practices.

"The Security Council is gravely concerned
by the persistent disregard of its resolutions on
children and armed conflict by parties to armed
conflict identified in the reports of the monitoring
and reporting mechanism, including parties to
whom precise, immediate and unequivocal
requests have been addressed. Recalling the
statement S/PRST/2006/48 made by its President
on 28 November 2006, the Security Council
reaffirms its intention to make use of all the tools
provided in its resolution 1612 (2005).

"The Security Council reiterates its call on
parties to armed conflict listed in the annexes of
the Secretary-General's report S/2007/757 that
have not already done so to prepare and
implement, without further delay, concrete time-
bound action plans to halt recruitment and use of
children in violation of applicable international
law, and to address all violations and abuses
against children in close cooperation with the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General,
as well as with UNICEF and the United Nations
country task forces on monitoring and reporting.

"The Security Council expresses concern
over the casualties inflicted on children in armed
conflict by the indiscriminate use of landmines
and cluster munitions, and in this regard calls
upon all parties to armed conflicts to desist from
such practice.

"In order to further strengthen the
comprehensive framework of the protection of
children in armed conflict, considering the
changing nature of armed conflicts and the issues
raised by the Secretary-General in his report, the
Security Council expresses its readiness to review
the relevant provisions of its resolutions on
children and armed conflict, building on the
provisions of resolution 1612 (2005), with a view
to further increasing the efficiency of its actions.

"The Security Council recognizes that a
stronger focus is required on the reintegration and
rehabilitation of children associated with armed
forces and armed groups, and in this regard
invites all parties concerned, including Member
States, regional organizations, the Secretariat and
other relevant United Nations entities, including
UNICEF, the United Nations Population Fund,
the United Nations Development Fund for

Women, the World Health Organization, the
United Nations Development Programme, the
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees, the Office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Human Rights, the
International Labour Organization and the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, the international financial
institutions, including the World Bank, as well as
civil society, to enhance their exchange of
information about programmes and best practices,
bearing in mind the relevant provisions of
international law, Security Council resolutions on
children and armed conflict, as well as the Paris
Principles to protect children from unlawful
recruitment by armed forces or groups, and
ensure that adequate resources and funding are
available to support national strategies or action
plans in the area of child protection and welfare,
and community-based programmes, with a View
to ensuring the long-term sustainability and
success of their programmatic response to the
release, rehabilitation and reintegration of all
children associated with armed forces and armed
groups.

"The Security Council requests the
Secretary-General to submit his next report by
May 2009 on the implementation of its
resolutions on children and armed conflict."

This statement will be published as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2008/6.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
current stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

Before adjourning the meeting, allow me to
express my gratitude once again for the difficult and
relevant work carried out on the issue of children and
armed conflict by the Office of the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General on Children and
Armed Conflict, UNICEF and the non-governmental
organizations. I also wish to thank France for its
leadership in this area and all Member States that have
participated in this important debate. In conclusion, I
thank the support staff for this meeting for their patience
and dedication.

The meeting rose at 8.15pm.
