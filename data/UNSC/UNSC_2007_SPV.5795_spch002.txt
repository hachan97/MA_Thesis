Mr. Suescum (Panama) (spoke in Spanish):
Panama would like to thank all who helped us in
drafting this resolution and, in particular, the United
States delegation.

We are of the opinion that today's decision to
postpone the review of the Counter-Terrorism
Committee Executive Directorate mandate is justified
because of the recent appointment of the new
Executive Director, Mr. Mike Smith. When it is time
for us to review this matter, Panama will give its
opinion on the substance of the renewal, but in the
meantime, we feel that we have taken the appropriate
decision.
