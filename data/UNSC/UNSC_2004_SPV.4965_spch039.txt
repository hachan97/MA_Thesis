Mr. Sharma: We have made a very serious
inroad into lunchtime, and I would not like to test the
apparent popularity of UNMISET by holding forth for
too long. Indeed, this is not required of me any more, I
feel, in the light of the statement by Senior Minister
Ana Pessoa Pinto. She has given much information and
clarification and important perspectives for all of us.

We have noted, however, the various points that
delegations have made on various issues and security
concerns on the rule of law, the national police and
further requirements to professionalize it, human
rights, serious crime and advisors to public
administration. I wish to advise the Council and the
delegations that we stand ready to throw further light
on any of these issues, should that be desired.

I would only like to restrict myself to thanking all
the delegations for their kind and complimentary words
directed to myself and to members of UNMISET. I will
faithfully communicate these sentiments soon after
return. I am convinced that the confidence and
encouragement expressed by the Council - indeed,
which I have always received - regarding the work
being done by them will further galvanize them
towards realizing the Council's goals for UNMISET,
particularly in this consolidation phase, should it be
approved by the Council and on which virtually all
members have spoken.
