The President: I invite the representative of Guinea
to resume the seat reserved for her at the side of the
Council Chamber.

At this point the Presidency would just like to thank
the distinguished speakers so far for the way they have
enriched the Council's discussions. I think it is clear from
the 11 interventions this morning that those who have
spoken under rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure share comprehensively the approach which
underlines the draft resolution on which we are about to
vote.

 

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it, as
orally revised in its provisional form. If I hear no objection,
I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council who
wish to make statements before the voting.
