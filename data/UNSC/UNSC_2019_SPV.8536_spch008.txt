Mr. Pecsteen de Buytswerve (Belgium) (spoke in French): Belgium welcomes the extension of the
sanctions regime, including the arms embargo, and
the extension of the mandate of the Panel of Experts
on South Sudan. The sanctions regime continues to be
part of the measures that are needed to contribute to the
stabilization of South Sudan. We appreciate the progress
made by the parties in the peace process. However,
a great deal of work remains to be done during the
extended pretransitional phase, including with respect
to security provisions and internal borders. The parties
must continue to work together to find consensus-
based solutions. Prematurely lifting the arms embargo
could have negative consequences, in particular for
the protection of civilians. We do not want to have to
shoulder such a responsibility.

Lastly, we commend the work done by the Panel
of Experts, which provides the Council with valuable
input on the situation on the ground.

I would also like to join others in thanking you,
Mr. President, for the work done by the Indonesian
presidency this month.
