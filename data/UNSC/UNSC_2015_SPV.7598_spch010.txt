Mrs. ngu (Nigeria): Nigeria welcomes the signing
on 17 December of the Libyan Political Agreement of
Skhirat, Morocco, which signals the acceptance by
Libyan leaders of a political solution to the conflict in
their country. Now, the people of Libya have chosen
the path of truth - the path to lasting peace - as
almost five years of conflict have proved that a military
solution is unattainable. The Agreement is a crucial
first step in stabilizing the country. The parties must
now begin to implement it in good faith.

Nigeria voted in favour of resolution 2259 (2015),
which the Council has just unanimously adopted,
with a sense of duty and responsibility. The resolution
demonstrates the Council's commitment to the peace,
security and stability of Libya. It addresses the key
challenges that Libya faces, notably the threat posed
by the Islamic State and other terrorist groups to the
security of the country. Nigeria fully supports the
formation of a Government of National Accord to
unite the country and confront those challenges with
a renewed sense of vigour. The people of Libya must
seize the moment and the opportunity to rebuild their
country. In that endeavour, all hands must be on deck to
support Libya's comprehensive reconstruction.
