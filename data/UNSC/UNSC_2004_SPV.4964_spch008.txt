Mr. De La Sabliere (France) (spoke in French): I
should like in turn to thank Mr. Passy for his presence
and for his statement here today. We listened most
attentively to his statement on the activities of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE), which will certainly prove of great use to us.

At a time when the Security Council and the
United Nations are increasingly called upon to
intervene to resolve regional conflicts that arise every
day on the Council's agenda, I believe that we are
seeking increasingly close cooperation between the
United Nations and regional organizations. I wish
simply to join colleagues who have spoken before me
in asking for Minister Passy's opinion about what
activities could be undertaken to strengthen
cooperation between the United Nations and OSCE.
We want to take advantage of his presence and
experience to further enrich our thinking.
