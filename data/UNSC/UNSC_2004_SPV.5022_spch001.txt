The President (spoke in Russian): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2004/648, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations. I should like to call the attention of
members to document 5/2004/604, containing the text
of a letter dated 11 August 2004 from the Chairman of
the Security Council Committee established pursuant

to resolution 751 (1992) concerning Somalia addressed
to the President of the Security Council.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall now put the draft
resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Algeria, Angola, Benin, Brazil, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Pakistan, Philippines,

Romania, Russian Federation, Spain, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America

The President (spoke in Russian): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1558 (2004).

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 12.30 pm.
