The President (spoke in Russian): Before
commenting on the proposed revised, I would like to
turn the members of the Council to see if there are
any remarks. If we proceed from the premise that this
paragraph is agreed, even if it was at the very last
minute and despite the protracted consultations on this
issue with the interested delegations, if delegations
consent to the inclusion of this oral revision to the draft
resolution and there are no objections, then we will vote
on the resolution as revised.

As there are no objections, I request that the
Secretariat inscribe this oral revision to the text of
the resolution.

The Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the
draft resolution before it. I shall put the draft resolution
to the vote now.

A vote was taken by show ofhands.

In favour:
Belgium, China, Cote d'Ivoire, Dominican
Republic, Equatorial Guinea, France, Germany,
Indonesia, Kuwait, Peru, Poland, Russian
Federation, South Africa, United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States
of America

The President (spoke in Russian): The draft
resolution received 15 votes in favour. The draft
resolution, as orally revision, has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 2489 (2019).

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements.
