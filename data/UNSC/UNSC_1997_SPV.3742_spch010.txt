Mr. Matuszewski (Poland): On behalf of the
Government of the Republic of Poland, I wish to offer
our condolences on the passing away of Mr. Deng
Xiaoping, a distinguished statesman and a leader of
international stature, whose long political journey marked
an important stage in the history of modern China.
Mr. Deng Xiaoping's legacy, as well as his long-standing
influence, which helped bring prosperity to millions of
Chinese people, will undoubtedly go down in history.

Once again, we wish to avail ourselves of this
opportunity to convey to the Chinese delegation our deep
sympathy, and to join them in their sorrow over the loss
of a man whose political skills and eminent personal
qualities will be remembered.
