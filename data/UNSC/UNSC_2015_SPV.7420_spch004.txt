Ms. Sison (United States of America): The United
States reaffirms its unwavering support for the critical
work of the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General, Mr. Bernardino Leon, in his tireless efforts to
facilitate the formation of a National Unity Government
as part of the next phase of Libya's political transition
through United Nations-led dialogue. Today's Security
Council resolutions - resolution 2213 (2015) and
2214 (2015) - reaffirm support for Leon's efforts to
facilitate a political dialogue in order to form a National
Unity Government. The Council also urges all parties
in Libya to engage constructively with Leon's efforts
and calls for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.

The United States stands firmly behind the
United Nations-led political dialogue process, Special
Representative Leen and his efforts to usher the
parties towards a lasting and peaceful settlement to
Libya's political and security crisis. In recent months
we have seen how violent extremist groups, such as
Daesh, Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL),
Ansar al-Sharia elements and Al-Qaida in the Islamic
Maghreb, are the only ones who benefit from a divided
Libya.

The most effective, comprehensive and sustainable
way to counter-terrorism is through a unified Libyan
effort, supported by the international community. It is
therefore critical that Libyans form a National Unity
Government as soon as possible.

With our vote today to renew the mandate for
Special Representative Leon's efforts, through the
mandate renewal of the United Nations Support
Mission in Libya, we signal our continued commitment
and determination to support a political resolution to
the crisis in Libya.
