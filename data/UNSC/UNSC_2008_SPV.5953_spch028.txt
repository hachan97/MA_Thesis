Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Ambassador Khalilzad's statement was rather
polemical, and I shall not respond: I think we have had
enough polemics today. I will limit myself to a
question of substance.

First of all, it is untrue to say that I did not
respond to the appeal for a ceasefire. I explained, in
realistic terms, the formula that could lead to putting
an end to the bloodshed. I explained it very clearly: the
Georgian military should withdraw from South Ossetia
and agree to sign an agreement on the non-use of force
in South Ossetia - and, we hope, also in Abkhazia. It
should be said that Georgian representatives are always
half-hinting that they agree - so why do they not do
it? Why do they not make a proper statement on this
matter and withdraw their forces from South Ossetia.
We will not prevent that.

On Ambassador Khalilzad's interesting reference
to a confidential diplomatic telephone call between our
Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Secretary of State,
I must say at the outset that regime change is an
American expression. We do not use such expressions.

But, as we know from history, sometimes there are
occasions when certain leaders are elected by their
peoples and come to power, either democratically or
semi-democratically, and become an obstacle to
enabling their own people from emerging from a given
situation. In such situations, some leaders take
courageous decisions with regard to their political
future. Sometimes, certain matters are discussed, inter
alia by diplomats. But I am encouraged by the fact that
Ambassador Khalilzad has referred to this publicly; I
suggest that this means that he finds it an interesting
idea and that he is ready to place it before the
international community for its verdict.
