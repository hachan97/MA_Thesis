Mr. Dejammet (France) (interpretation from French):
The draft resolution before us is necessary. It describes a
situation that has become intolerable over the years:
ongoing conflict, external interference, discrimination, the
assassination of Iranian diplomatic personnel, the murders
of high-ranking United Nations officials, humanitarian crisis
and unacceptable constraints imposed upon humanitarian
agencies and non-governmental organizations.

We pay tribute to the tireless and intelligent work of
the Secretary-General's Special Envoy, Mr. Brahimi, whose
most recent mission helped to reduce tensions in the region.
He deserves all our support.

We also understand the Secretary-General's proposals,
which we believe can be implemented, provided, of course,
that all necessary security measures are taken. For the time
being, however, the fighting goes on and we must
acknowledge that negotiations between the parties have yet
to resume. The United Front is prepared to open a political
dialogue with the Taliban and to conclude a ceasefire. The
Taliban, for its part, has shown no readiness to resume the
negotiations or to put an end to hostilities.
It is therefore fitting that the draft resolution before us,
while referring to all the factions, concerns the Taliban first
and foremost and lays out the Council's demands to it. It is
also appropriate that the draft - like the previous
resolution on this topic, which laid out the terms of a
settlement - should reflect the idea that the Council is
prepared to consider imposing further measures in order
fully to implement its resolutions. Thus, this is yet another
text responding to the difficulties and gravity of events in
Afghanistan and my country will therefore vote in its
favour.
