Mr. Kovanda (Czech Republic): The position of
my country on the current situation in Jerusalem was
expressed through you, Mr. President, when you delivered
the statement of the European Union during the Council's
recent meeting on this agenda item. Today I shall add just
one or two remarks.

Whatever the motivations for doing so, and whatever
its purpose, we find the expropriation of land in East
Jerusalem to be ill-timed, unwise and, indeed, in violation
of relevant Security Council resolutions. We do, however,
take note of the decision by the Israeli Government of
14 May 1995 according to which it has no intention of
carrying out additional expropriations of land in East
Jerusalem for housing purposes, and we would have
preferred this decision to be reflected in the draft
resolution.

On the other hand, one wonders, since the Israeli
Government has no expropriative intentions for the future,
how indispensable it was to expropriate land last month.

 

The Declaration of Principles envisages a discussion
of issues affecting Jerusalem to take place in a little more
distant future. Also, it envisages resolving issues such as
this one between the parties themselves. We are sorry that
this did not happen; of course, this does not stop the
Security Council from dealing with a matter that violates
the spirit if not, perhaps, the letter of the Declaration, and
it is therefore quite proper to debate the issue here and to
vote on the draft resolution.

In conclusion, I wish to reiterate my country's
wholehearted support for the Middle East peace process.
We are looking forward to the speedy implementation of
the Declaration, in its entirety.
