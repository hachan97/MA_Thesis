Mr. Bessho (Japan): Japan welcomes the unanimous

adoption ofresolution 2336 (2016). Japan also welcomes
the efforts of the Russian Federation and Turkey to
bring about a nationwide cessation of hostilities. Japan
supported the draft resolution because we hope that the
cessation of hostilities across Syria can open a path
to the fundamental improvement of the devastating
humanitarian situation there.

As with resolution 2328 (2016), adopted
unanimously two weeks ago (see S/PV.7841), the United
Nations should coordinate humanitarian assistance
efforts under this cessation of hostilities. We do not
want to hear any more reports by the United Nations
or other implementing partners of obstructions or
delays in gaining access to besieged or hard-to-reach
areas by the Syrian Government. We urge the Syrian
Government to take measures to allow immediate and
unhindered access.

Japan calls upon the guarantors of the cessation of
hostilities to elaborate monitoring mechanisms with
the United Nations and the International Syria Support
Group (ISSG) task force. We take note of the serious
concern about the possibility of further attacks on
civilians in all areas of Syria. Japan urges Russia and
Turkey, as guarantors, to fully address these concerns.
As prescribed in paragraph 3 of the resolution, we look
forward to the Astana meeting to be held in January.
Japan hopes the meeting will have the participation
of key regional stakeholders and will meaningfully
contribute to Special Envoy De Mistura's formal
political process.

As a member ofthe Council and ofthe ISSG, Japan
reiterates its determination to contribute responsibly to
addressing the situation in Syria. I would like to take this
opportunity to thank Spain for its excellent presidency
this month. I would also like to thank the five outgoing
non-permanent members for their assiduous efforts in
the Council during their two-year terms.
