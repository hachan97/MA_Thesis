At the outset, I thank Special Envoy Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary- General Mark Lowcock and General Abhijit Guha, Head of the United Nations Mission to Support the Hodeidah Agreement (UNMHA), and I would like to reiterate our appreciation of their efforts to help Yemen, especially during these very difficult and uncertain times. Yemen, which has been ravaged by war and is witnessing the largest humanitarian crisis in the world, with millions of displaced persons and more than half the population in urgent need of humanitarian or protection support, is facing the imminent danger of a potential outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which threatens to further deepen the suffering of the Yemeni people. The continuing hostilities and escalation can only make this outbreak unstoppable and extremely deadly, in a country with an infrastructure devastated by war and that does not have the resources or the preparedness to deal with this pandemic, and where fighting and armed groups are continuing to block access to humanitarian aid. In this regard, as we reiterate Tunisia's full support for the Secretary- General's appeal for a global ceasefire and his call to end hostilities in Yemen and ramp up efforts to counter a potential outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we underscore Special Envoy Griffiths' proposals on a ceasefire, a resumption of the political process and economic and humanitarian measures to alleviate the suffering of the Yemeni people, build confidence and support Yemen's ability to respond to the pandemic. In the same perspective, Tunisia welcomes the announcement made by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, on behalf of the coalition, in support of a unilateral ceasefire in Yemen. We also commend the Government of Yemen's positive response in support of the United Nations peace process. Tunisia stresses the urgent need to build on these efforts for an immediate and effective cessation of hostilities and de-escalation, so as to create a conducive environment for the parties to discuss the proposals on steps and mechanisms to implement a permanent ceasefire and retake the path of political settlement towards a comprehensive political solution in Yemen. In that connection, we endorse the efforts of Special Envoy Martin Griffiths, and we call for the full implementation of the Stockholm and Riyadh agreements to enhance confidence-building measures. In conclusion, we reiterate Tunisia's principled position that there can be no military solution in Yemen and that only through dialogue and peaceful negotiations will the parties be able to reach a comprehensive settlement, in line with the terms of reference established by the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative and its Implementation Mechanism, the outcome of the Comprehensive National Dialogue and the relevant Security Council resolutions, to end the conflict, alleviate the suffering of the Yemeni people and restore peace and stability in Yemen.
