Mr. Konishi (Japan): I should like at the outset to
express the sincere appreciation of my delegation to you,
Sir, for the kind words you conveyed to Ambassador
Owada in his capacity as the previous President of the
Security Council.

My delegation will vote in favour of the draft
resolution before us, which would decide to establish a
third trial chamber of the International Tribunal for the
Former Yugoslavia and would decide also that three
additional judges should be elected.

My delegation believes that the prosecution of
persons responsible for serious violations of international
humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former
Yugoslavia is a prerequisite for true reconciliation among
the ethnic groups and for the restoration and maintenance
of peace in the former Yugoslavia.

 

At the same time, we are aware that the constantly
increasing workload of the Tribunal, particularly in the last
several months, has made it difficult for the Tribunal to
conduct its important tasks effectively. This problem creates
difficulties in bringing to justice without delay those
responsible for the tragedy and the atrocities which took
place in the former Yugoslavia, and also in ensuring that
the accused will have fair and expeditious trials.

My delegation is convinced that the trial chamber and
judges to be added by the terms of the draft resolution,
together with additional efforts by the Tribunal to improve
the effectiveness of its functioning, will contribute to
resolving these difficulties.

Finally, my delegation wishes, on behalf of the
Government of Japan, to pay high tribute to the significant
and diligent work of the Tribunal so far, and to stress the
importance of full cooperation by all States with the
Tribunal in accordance with their obligations under the
relevant resolution.
