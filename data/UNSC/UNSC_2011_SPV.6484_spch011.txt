Ms. Colakovie (Bosnia and Herzegovina):
Bosnia and Herzegovina voted for the draft resolution,
and I wish to explain our position.

Bosnia and Herzegovina is and will remain
committed to the two-State solution, with the State of
Israel and an independent, democratic and viable State
of Palestine living side by side in peace and security.
We consider that to be a basic precondition for
achieving lasting peace and security in the region.

One of the main obstacles to achieving that goal
is the settlement activities on occupied land, which are
illegal under international law and are contrary to
Israel's obligation under the Road Map. Bosnia and
Herzegovina calls upon Israel to respond positively to
appeals by the international community and end all
settlement activities in occupied Palestinian territories,
including Jerusalem.

Furthermore, we urge the parties to take the
necessary decision to overcome the current obstacles in
the peace process as the only way to secure a better
future for their peoples through a resumption of direct
talks.
