Mr. Mayoral (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish):
Argentina, too, was a sponsor of today's resolution, on
which France and the United States did the preliminary
work. In my capacity as Chairman of the Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999), which
provided the framework for debate, I thank all
Committee members for their constructive
contributions to the discussions on reformulating the
listing and delisting procedures of the sanctions
committees.

The changes represent progress in the defence of
human rights and in awareness-raising among all
members of the Council on the need to operate - both
in the fight against the terrorism of Al-Qaida and the
Taliban and in the context of the work of the other
sanctions committees - in respect for the law and
human rights. I recall that those objectives represent
Argentina's core convictions over the past two years in
its capacity as a non-permanent member of the Security
Council.
