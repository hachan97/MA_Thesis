Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation has consistently
advocated the strengthening of stability in Lebanon and
the normalization of the situation in Syria, thereby
promoting relations of equality and genuine good-
neighbourliness between those countries in the
interests of the Lebanese and Syrian peoples and
strengthening security in the region.

We are convinced that Lebanon's sovereignty,
unity and territorial integrity can be strengthened
exclusively through dialogue between Damascus and
Beirut. Moreover, recent positive progress in the
settlement of a number of border issues between the
two countries clearly demonstrates that the
opportunities exist to do so.

Today's resolution is a departure from the
aforementioned tasks. It does not help to achieve a
constructive settlement of the issues pending between
the two countries or to further establish mutual
understanding between them. The Russian delegation
did not see any particular need at this stage for any
further substantive reaction on the part of the Security
Council on issues related to Syrian-Lebanese relations.

Nevertheless, we expressed our willingness to
agree to an official presidential statement, offering our
own amendments and proposals. Unfortunately, the
sponsors of the resolution did not take those duly into
account and full agreement could not be reached. The
sponsors' approach was not in line with the established
practice of the Security Council and should not set a
precedent in this principal organ for the maintenance of
international peace and security.

On that basis, the Russian Federation found it
impossible to support the resolution.
