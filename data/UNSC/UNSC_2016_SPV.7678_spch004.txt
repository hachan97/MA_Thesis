Mr. Malok (South Sudan): Since this is the first
time my delegation is taking the floor to address the
Council during your presidency, Sir, I would like to take
the opportunity to congratulate the Chinese delegation
on its assumption of that responsibility for the month
of April. I would like to assure you of my delegation's
full cooperation and to wish you every success in your
leadership during the few days of your presidency
that remain. I would also like to take this opportunity
to thank Mr. Herve' Ladsous for his briefing and the
Council for allowing me to speak on an important
subject for my country.

As we meet today, we fully recognize the urgent
need there is for the parties to the Agreement on the
Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South
Sudan to form a transitional Government of national
unity. Despite the delay, of which everyone is aware,
the Government of the Republic of South Sudan is
firm in its commitment to fully implementing the
Agreement. The swearing-in of Mr. Riek Machar
as First Vice-President has opened a new chapter in
that implementation. Mr. Machar's swearing-in today
will be followed a day or two later by the formation
of a transitional Government of national unity, after
consultation with the various parties.

My Government hereby acknowledges the
significant support we have received from the
international community, particularly through its
intervention in the conflict in South Sudan. We
therefore call on the Security Council to remain seized
of the situation with the parties as we come closer
to taking the first step in implementing the peace
agreement process.

In conclusion, I would like to reaffirm my
Government's full commitment to implementing the
Agreement in its entirety.
