The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received letters from the representatives of
Albania and the Solomon Islands, in which they request to
be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Kulla (Albania)
and Mr. Horoi (Solomon Islands) took the seats
reserved for them at the side of the Council Chamber.
