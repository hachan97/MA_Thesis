The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on the agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have received photocopies of
a letter dated 27 March 1996 from the Permanent
Representative of Chile to the United Nations addressed to
the President of the Security Council which will be issued
as a document of the Security Council under the symbol
S/ 1996/224.

Following consultations among the members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council has reviewed the
arrangements for consultations and exchange of
information with troop contributing countries, which
were established by the statement of its President
made on behalf of the Council on 4 November 1994,
contained in document SfPRST/1994/62. The Council
has given careful consideration to the views expressed
on this question in its debate under the item 'An
agenda for peace: peace-keeping in its 3611th meeting
on 20 December 1995, as well as to the views
expressed in debates in the General Assembly.

"The Security Council has noted the wish
expressed in these debates that arrangements for
consultation and exchange of information with troop
contributing countries should be improved. The
Council shares this wish. It considers it essential for
troop contributing countries to be heard. It notes that
many of the concerns expressed would be met if the
arrangements set out in the statement of its President
of 4 November 1994 were fully implemented. It is
also of the View that those arrangements can be
strengthened further as set forth below.

"The Security Council will therefore follow in
future the procedures here set out:
"(a) Meetings will be held as a matter of course
between members of the Council, troop contributing
countries and the Secretariat for the purpose of
consultations and the exchange of information and
views; the meetings will be chaired by the
presidency of the Council supported by a
representative of the Secretariat;

"(b) The meetings will be held as soon as
practicable and in good time before the Council
takes decisions on the extension or termination of, or
significant changes in, the mandate of a particular
peace-keeping operation;

"(c) When the Council considers establishing a
new peace-keeping operation, meetings will, unless
it proves to be impracticable, be held with any
prospective troop contributors who have already
been approached by the Secretariat and who have
indicated that they may be willing to contribute to
the operation;

"(d) The President of the Council will, in the
course of informal consultations of members of the
Council, report the views expressed by participants
at each meeting with troop contributing or
prospective troop contributing countries;

"(e) The existing practice of inviting to these
meetings Member States which make special
contributions to peace-keeping operations other than
troops - that is, contributions to trust funds,
logistics and equipment - will continue;

"(f) The monthly tentative forecast of work of
the Council made available to Member States will
include an indication of the expected schedule of
such meetings for the month;

"(g) Ad hoc meetings may be convened in the
event of unforeseen developments in a particular
peace-keeping operation which could require action
by the Council;

"(h) These meetings will be in addition to those
convened and chaired by the Secretariat for troop
contributors to meet with Special Representatives of
the Secretary-General or Force Commanders, or to
discuss operational matters concerning particular
peace-keeping operations, to which members of the
Security Council will also be invited;

 

"(i) Background information and an agenda will
be circulated by the Secretariat to the participants well
in advance of each of the various meetings referred to
above; members of the Council may also circulate
information as appropriate;
"(D Interpretation services in all the official languages of the Organization will continue to be
available; translation of written documents will
continue to be available, if possible in advance of the
meetings;

"(k) The time and venue of each meeting should,
where possible, appear in advance in the Journal of
the United Nations;

"(1) The Council will append to its annual report
to the General Assembly information about these
meetings.

"The Security Council recalls that the
arrangements described above are not exhaustive.
They do not preclude consultations in a variety of
forms, including informal communication between
the Council President or its members and troop
contributing countries and, as appropriate, with other
countries especially affected, for example, countries
from the region concerned.

"The Security Council will continue to keep
arrangements for consultations and the exchange of
information and views with troop contributors and
prospective contributors under review and stands
ready to consider further measures and new
mechanisms to enhance further the arrangements in
the light of experience."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/l996/13.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.

The meeting rose at 1 pm.
