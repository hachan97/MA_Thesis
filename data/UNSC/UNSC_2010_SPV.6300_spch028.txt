Mr. Kamara (Sierra Leone): 1 have the honour to
speak on behalf of the African Group at this open
debate on the implementation of the note by the
President of the Security Council (S/2006/507) and to
express our continued support for Japan's presidency in
the month of April, and particularly for convening a
session on this all important subject to assess the
implementation of the measures set out in the annex to
document S/2006/507, following the debate of August
2008 (see S/PV.5968).

At the outset, the African Group aligns itself with
the statement made by the representative of Egypt on
behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, and further
wishes to reiterate its correspondence of 23 December
2009 addressed to the facilitator of the ongoing reform
process.

The fact that the rules of procedure of this very
important organ of the Organization remain provisional
clearly points to a lacuna in the working methods of
the Council. Clearly, there is a missing link in the
working methods of the Council, which makes it
extremely expedient for the organ to undergo a reality
check. This explains why the African Group has
consistently called for a thorough reform that would
make the Council responsive to the urgent needs of the
increasingly turbulent world of the twenty-first
century.

In addressing the theme of today's open debate on
working methods, I must hasten to reaffirm that we
support an expeditious and comprehensive reform
process, embracing all the negotiable clusters, that will
make the Security Council more representative,
transparent, inclusive, accountable, effective and
efficient in executing its responsibilities in order to
ensure that its decisions are legitimate and
representative of the views and positions of the wider
membership.

We acknowledge that the Security Council has
made significant progress in taking measures to
promote some degree of efficiency and transparency in
the manner in which it conducts its business, thanks to
the efforts of its Informal Working Group on

Documentation and Other Procedural Questions and
especially with the adoption of the note by the
President of the Security Council contained in
document S/2006/507 and subsequent notes related to
the working methods of the Council. We encourage
further efforts in this direction through the practice of
incoming Presidents to brief non-members on the
programme of work at the beginning of each month.
The introduction of written annual reports covering the
operations of the subsidiary bodies, including the latest
measure requiring each Council's presidency to prepare
a published assessment of its operations, among other
things, are all steps in the right direction of making the
Council more responsive to the general membership.

Despite the aforementioned noteworthy attempts
of the Council to live up to the expectations of its
members and non-members, it is the considered View
of the African Group that the measures are not far-
reaching enough to endow the Council with sufficient
capacity to deliver on its moral obligations as a
representative, transparent, democratic and accountable
decision-making body charged with the principal
responsibility of the United Nations, and some of
whose decisions are binding on the entire membership.

Africa favours a more accessible, democratic,
representative, accountable and effective Security
Council that responds to the exigencies of our time. In
this connection, I should like to state the African
common position on the Council's working methods,
as adopted at the fourteenth ordinary session of the
Assembly of the African Union in Addis Ababa on
31 January 2010, which complements the African
common position on Security Council reform, as
contained in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte
Declaration.

The Security Council should increase the number
of public meetings, in accordance with Articles 31 and
32 of the Charter of the United Nations; allow for
briefings by special envoys or special representatives
of the Secretary-General and representatives of the
Secretariat to take place in public meetings, unless
there are exceptional circumstances; enhance its
relationship with the Secretariat and troop-contributing
countries, including through sustained, regular and
timely interaction to allow for the effective planning
and implementation of mission objectives; uphold the
primacy of and respect for the Charter in connection
with its functions and powers and in accordance with
the provisions of Article 24 of the Charter; provide

adequate and timely information on its activities to the
general membership of the United Nations; avoid any
attempt to use it to pursue national political agendas
and ensure non-selectivity and impartiality in its work;
refrain from resorting to Chapter VII of the Charter as
an umbrella for addressing issues that do not
necessarily pose a threat to international peace and
security, but fully utilize the provisions of Chapters VI
and VIII before invoking Chapter VII, which should be
a measure of last resort, if necessary; avoid any
recourse to the imposition, prolongation or extension
of sanctions against any State under the pretext or with
the aim of achieving the political objectives of one or a
few States, rather than in the general interest of the
international community; and formalize its provisional
rules of procedure in order to improve its transparency
and accountability.

Given that the Security Council and the General
Assembly must work closely together within their
respective spheres in seeking solutions to the plethora
of challenges confronting the international community,
we have emphasized the need for regular consultations
and the effective and timely exchange and flow of
information between the Assembly and the Council,
and for the submission of more comprehensive and
analytical reports to the General Assembly, including
special subject-oriented reports and informative press
releases on current issues of international concern.

Africa is strongly of the view that efforts aimed
at restructuring the Security Council should not be
subjected to a predetermined timetable. Even though
we recognize the need to deal with the issue as a matter
of urgency, we are of the view that all five clusters
should be accorded the same sense of expediency.

The Sirte Declaration and the Ezulwini
Consensus, which are our guiding instruments in the
matter of the reform of the Security Council, further
underscore the need to improve the balance of
competence between the General Assembly and the
Security Council. The proverbial delicate umbilical
cord essentially interlinks all the clusters. Thus, no
attempt should be made to exclude or even render any
one of them less important in the reform process.
