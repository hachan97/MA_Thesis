The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Australia, Fiji, Japan, New Zealand
and Papua New Guinea, in which they request to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Aisi (Papua New Guinea) took a seat at the Council table;
Mr. Dauth (Australia), Mr. Savua (Fiji),
Mr. Naraguchi (Japan) and Mr. MacKay (New Zealand) took the seats reserved for them at the
side of the Council Chamber

The President (spoke in French): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Danilo Turk, Assistant Secretary-
General for Political Affairs.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Tiirk to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2003/345, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the United Nations Political
Office in Bougainville.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Danilo Turk, Assistant Secretary-
General for Political Affairs. I now give him the floor.
