Mr. Barbalie (Bosnia and Herzegovina): At the
outset, allow me to reiterate Bosnia and Herzegovina's
grave concern regarding the rapidly deteriorating
situation in Libya. Human lives must be protected and
human rights and humanitarian law must be observed.
The need for humanitarian assistance to be provided to
Libyans is urgent. Therefore, enabling the unimpeded
passage for the delivery of humanitarian aid is a
prerogative.

Bosnia and Herzegovina supports the
involvement of regional stakeholders in searching for
an end to the Libyan crisis. We believe that the
coordinated approach of international actors, the
United Nations, the League of Arab States, the African
Union and other regional organizations is crucial to
finding the most adequate solution to the crisis in
Libya.

By fully supporting Libya's sovereignty and
territorial integrity, Bosnia and Herzegovina calls once
again on the Libyan authorities to immediately stop all
military and other violent acts against the Libyan
people. We strongly believe that resolution 1973
(2011)) is for the benefit of the Libyan people and their
aspiration to peace and democracy.
