Mr. DeLaurentis (United States of America): Let
me address an issue unrelated to our debate that was
raised earlier today, namely, the United States efforts to
prevent terrorism and the recent disclosure of classified
information about techniques we use to do that.

All Governments do things that are secret: it is a
fact of modern governing and a necessity in the light of
the threats all our citizens face. Our counter-terrorism
policy is ultimately about saving people's lives, which
is why the United States works with other countries
to protect our citizens and those of other nations from
many threats. All nations should be concerned about
the damage these disclosures can cause to our ability to
collectively defend against those threats.

The United States commitment to advancing
universal human rights dates to our founding, and
continues strongly to this day under President Obama.
Therefore, we welcome a fair discussion about the
appropriate balance between privacy and security, and
will continue to work with our partners to address the
many challenges and threats we all face.
