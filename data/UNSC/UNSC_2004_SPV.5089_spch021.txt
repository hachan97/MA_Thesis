The President: I thank Ambassador Van den
Berg for his statement. I invite him to resume the seat
reserved for him at the side of the Council Chamber.
The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Switzerland whom I invite to take a
seat at the Council table. I give the floor to
Ambassador Maurer of Switzerland.
