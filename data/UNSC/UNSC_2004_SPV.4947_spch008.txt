Mr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China has always believed that the independence,
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus deserves
full respect and we support an appropriate negotiated
settlement of the differences between the two
communities. We appreciate the untiring efforts of
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his Special Adviser
to that end.

On 24 April, the Greek and Turkish Cypriots will
hold referendums on the final settlement plan proposed
by the Secretary-General. We believe that the Cypriot
communities will make the right choice. We hope to
see an early, just and lasting solution to the question of
Cyprus.

On that basis, the Chinese delegation voted in
favour of the draft resolution. It should be noted,
however, that we had hoped that the Council would
carry out further consultations and consider fully the
views of all parties with a view to achieving consensus.
None of us wished to see the current state of affairs.
