Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
welcomes the Council's unanimous adoption of
resolution 2235 (2015). China's position on chemical
weapons is clear and consistent. We resolutely
oppose the use of chemical weapons by anyone in
any circumstance. We express our concern over the
use in Syria of chlorine gas as a weapon, as verified
by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons (OPCW). We support the objective, just and
professional investigation of that incident and bringing
the perpetrators to justice when there is hard evidence.

In that process, the independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Syria must be respected and the
OPCW and the United Nations should play their full
roles in the investigation. China expects the Secretary-
General soon to submit his report on the establishment
of the Joint Investigative Mechanism, as called for in
resolution 2235 (2015).
A political settlement is the only way to resolve
the Syrian issue. At present, Special Envoy De Mistura
is working tirelessly to advance a political settlement
to the Syrian issue. The international community, and
the Security Council in particular, should stay the
course, never waver in striving for a political solution
and unanimously support the United Nations role in
that process, and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and
Special Envoy De Mistura in their good offices.

China hopes that resolution 2235 (2015), which was
adopted by consensus, will help to further unanimity
among Council members on the Syrian issue and
give new impetus to the search for a comprehensive,
enduring and appropriate settlement of the matter
through political means at an early date. China shall
continue to play a positive and constructive role to that
end.
