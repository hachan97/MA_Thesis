Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
listened closely to the briefing by Prosecutor Bensouda.
In recent years, the political and security situation in
Darfur has improved. The Sudanese Government signed
an agreement on relaunching the Doha negotiations with
the Sudan Liberation Army-Minni Minawi, the Justice
and Equality Movement and other armed groups. This is
conducive to further improving the situation in Darfur.
China appreciates the efforts made by the Sudanese
Government to maintain peace and stability in Darfur
and to promote the political process.

Developments in Darfur have shown that the
Sudanese Government is fully capable of gradually
taking over the responsibility for the maintenance of
international peace and stability in Darfur. It is our
hope that the international community will continue
to respect the ownership of the Sudanese Government
on the question of Darfur and provide constructive
assistance for peace and security in Darfur so as
to achieve lasting peace, stability and sustainable
development there.

China's position on the International Criminal
Court (ICC) remains unchanged. China hopes that
the Security Council and the ICC will fully respect
the judicial sovereignty of the Sudan, fully heed the
legitimate demands of the African Union and the
Sudanese Government made to the ICC concerning
the Sudan, and fully respect the views of the African
Union and the League of Arab States. China has always
believed that Heads of State enjoy privileges and
immunity under international law. The referral by the
Security Council of the situation to the ICC does not
automatically remove the immunity of Heads of State.
