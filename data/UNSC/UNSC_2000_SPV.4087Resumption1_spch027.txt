The President: The next speaker is the representative
of South Africa. I invite him to take a seat at the Council
table.

I would remind members that, next week, we will
have the honour of being joined here in the Burundi
discussion by Mr. Nelson Mandela, the mediator for
Burundi. I hope the representative of South Africa will
extend to him the high appreciation of the entire Security
Council that he will honour us for what I understand will
be his first appearance before the Security Council.

I invite the representative of South Africa to make his
statement.
