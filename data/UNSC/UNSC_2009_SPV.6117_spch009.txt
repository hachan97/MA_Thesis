Mr. Mayr-Harting (Austria): Austria
wholeheartedly supports the renewal of the mandate of
the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in
Western Sahara (MINURSO) for another 12 months. It
is very important, from our point of view, that the
Council has been able to achieve unity in this matter,
because resolution 1871 (2009) provides the Secretary-
General and his Personal Envoy with the unanimous
message of support by the Council that they need for
their efforts to bring both parties back to the
negotiating table as soon as possible.

In the field of human rights, Austria supports a
results-oriented approach. Both parties have the
obligation to ensure respect for the human rights of the
people of Western Sahara. Against this background, we
believe that the populations in the territory and in the
refugee camps would greatly benefit in their enjoyment
of human rights from a new resolve by both parties in
the negotiation process. A continuous and constructive
dialogue with the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights as suggested by the
Secretary-General could help the parties to approach
the issue of human rights protection and promotion
from a confidence-building perspective.
