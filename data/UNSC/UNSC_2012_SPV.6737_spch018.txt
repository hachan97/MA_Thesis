Mr. Osorio (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I
shall be brief. I should first like to thank Council
members for their responses to and comments on the
report that was presented, which overall reflects the
work of the members of the Committee, whom I thank
for their contributions and guidance.

I should like also to highlight the work of the
Panel of Experts, carried out under difficult conditions
and with complete commitment and dedication. It
deserves commendation, as does the Secretariat, which
has provided guidance and assistance in a very serious-
minded and professional manner.

I welcome the fact that the initiative of members
to convene a briefing open to Member States has
received the support that has been evident here. I
suggest that such a meeting be convened during the
first two weeks of April, if possible. We are working
with the Secretariat to determine the availability of
rooms, and we trust that we will be able to settle on a
date, which will then be duly made known to Council
members.
