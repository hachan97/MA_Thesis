Ms. Citaku: I apologize for taking up more of the
Council's time. We have said several times today that
the world has much more pressing issues to discuss.
Nevertheless, I must reiterate several things.

The time when Kosovo sought permission and
cleared its speeches with Belgrade is over. We are not
afraid to tell our story. We are not afraid to deal with
our own past. There was a terrible war, and in war
terrible things happen. But one should never try to put
a question mark between State-sponsored crime and
individual actions. There is a difference. Again, we are
ready to deal with our past. We hope that Serbia will
soon be able to deal with its past.

When it comes to international law, again, I must
reiterate that the International Court of Justice, as the
highest and most professional body, issued an opinion
about Kosovo's declaration of independence and its
legality. The opinion was clear and unambiguous:
Kosovo was within its rights when it declared its
independence and we are sui generis and unlike any
other ongoing or future dispute.

I was in fact happy to hear my colleague from
Belgrade refer to our agreement as an international
agreement. But we were not the only ones to request
an opinion from the constitutional court. Serbia did the

same some months ago with the agreement on diplomas.
I want to reassure the Council that we will implement
every agreement that we reached in Brussels - every
single one - but not at the cost of the functionality of
our State. That is what the ruling of the constitutional
court suggested.

I also want to say that we are for reconciliation. But
reconciliation cannot be built on denial. Reconciliation
can be built only if we can stand tall and look at the
past without fearing it - although for some that might
be quite shameful.
