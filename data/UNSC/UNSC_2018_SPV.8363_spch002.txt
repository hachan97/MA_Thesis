President Trump and Chairman Kim, the President has

directed me to travel to Pyongyang next month to meet
with Chairman Kim and to accelerate that process.
I want to reiterate that the future can be very bright
for North Korea if it makes good on its commitment to
final, fully verified denuclearization. It will lead to the
positive transformation of relations between the United
States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,
to greater prosperity for the North Korean people, and
to an enduring peace. In our Vision for a free and open
Indo-Pacific, nations are strong, sovereign, connected,
prosperous and at peace, but that vision for the region
will never be complete if we fail to bring about this
transformation on the Korean peninsula. The Korean
people, the region and the world will never realize
the full promise of the future if we do not seize this
unprecedented diplomatic opening for peace.

I said at the beginning of my statement that we are
at the dawn of a new day in the world's relationship with
North Korea. We do not yet know what that day will
bring, but we are hopeful that the current breakthrough
in diplomacy will yield a brighter future for North
Korea and a safer world for all of us. I look forward to
the discussion.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

I give the floor to the Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Kuwait.
