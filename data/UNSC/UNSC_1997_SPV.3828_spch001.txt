The President (interpretation from Spanish): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have received photocopies of
a letter dated 29 October 1997 from the Permanent
Representative of Iraq to the United Nations addressed to
the President of the Security Council, transmitting a letter
of the same date from the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq to
the President of the Security Council, which will be issued
as a document of the Security Council under the symbol
S/1997/829.

Following consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council has considered the letter
of 29 October 1997 from the Deputy Prime Minister
of Iraq to the President of the Security Council
conveying the unacceptable decision of the
Government of Iraq to seek to impose conditions on
its cooperation with the Special Commission, thereby
preventing the Special Commission from discharging
its responsibilities under Security Council resolutions
687 (1991), 699 (1991), 707 (1991), 715 (1991), 1051
(1996), 1060 (1996), 1115 (1997) and 1134 (1997).

"The Security Council recalls its demands in
resolution 1134 (1997) that Iraq cooperate fully with
the Special Commission in accordance with the
relevant resolutions, which constitute the governing
standard of Iraqi compliance.

"The Security Council condemns the decision
of the Government of Iraq to try to dictate the terms
of its compliance with its obligation to cooperate
with the Special Commission. It demands that Iraq
cooperate fully, in accordance with the relevant
resolutions and without conditions or restrictions,
with the Special Commission in the implementation
of its mandate. The Council furthermore reminds the
Government of Iraq of its responsibility for the
safety and security of the personnel of the Special
Commission and its inspection teams.

"The Security Council warns of the serious
consequences of Iraq's failure to comply
immediately and fully with its obligations under the
relevant resolutions. The Council is determined to
ensure rapid and full Iraqi compliance with the
relevant resolutions and for that purpose will remain
actively seized of the matter."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/1997/49.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 6.15 pm.
