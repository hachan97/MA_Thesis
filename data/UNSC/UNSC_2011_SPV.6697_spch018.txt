Mr. Osorio (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I
would like to thank the members of the Security
Council for their kind words, as well as to express my
gratitude to mission experts who participated in the
work of the Committee for their devotion and the
seriousness with which they approached the issues
under the purview of the sanctions Committee.

It is clear that concerns abound, such as the
difficulties in making available and publishing reports
of the Panel of Experts. I hope to be able to find a way
reach an understanding so that this aspect of
transparency can be guaranteed, for not only the
members of the Council but also other Members of the
United Nations expect such transparency and
information about the work of committees.

There are still some very serious concerns, which
I interpret as a need to step up the Committee's work
and to continue to guide the Panel of Experts in order

that it carries out its tasks - as you, Mr. President,
have said - in accordance with the mandate it has
been given.
