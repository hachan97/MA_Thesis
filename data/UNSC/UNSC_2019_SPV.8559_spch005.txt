Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese):
Haiti is encountering a multiplicity of challenges on
the political, security and humanitarian fronts. The
United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti
(MINUJUSTH) and the peacekeeping mission that
preceded it have played an important role in assisting
Haiti in achieving stability and enhancing capacity-
building in the area of security.

China supports the establishment of the United
Nations Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH), after the
expiry of the mandate of MINUJUSTH, with a view
to achieving an orderly transition and continuing to
assist the Haitian Government in maintaining political
stability, conducting a nationwide dialogue, training
the Haitian National Police and responding to security
challenges. We believe that the Security Council has
the primary responsibility for maintaining international
peace and security, and that BINUH's mandate must be
clear and concise if it is to assist Haiti in responding to
peace and security issues. China participated actively
in the consultations on the text of resolution 2476
(2019) and proposed amendments to it. Regrettably, the
final text failed to fully reflect our legitimate concerns,
which is why China abstained in the voting today.
China is ready to engage with the rest of the members
ofthe Council injoint efforts to ensure that BINUH can
fully carry out its mandate and play an active role in
promoting stability and development in Haiti.
