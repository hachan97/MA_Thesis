The President (spoke in French): I thank the
Minister for Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
for the very useful information he has given about the
tripartite meeting held at Abuja from 6 to 8 December
2001, as well as for his kind words addressed to me.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is
Mr. James Wapakhabulo, Third Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uganda. I invite
him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his
statement.
