The President: We have reached the end of the
list. May I, on behalf of my Minister, thank everyone
who has spoken and taken part in this debate. I believe
55 participants is a record for a debate of this nature. I
welcome in particular the large number of non-Council
members - by definition, 40 - who spoke in this
debate, many of them members of the Non-Aligned
Movement and the Group of 77.

In aggregate, I think we have brought out the
complexity of the issue, the challenge that climate
change represents for all of us and the need for us to
tackle, in a myriad of different ways and places, the
many aspects of the problem and to try to mitigate the
threats, because it is by mitigating the threats that the
role of the Security Council hopefully becomes
redundant.

No doubt, we will all want to reflect carefully on
what we have discussed and heard today. May I end by
extending a warm thank-you to everybody.
