Mr. Hunter (United States of America): The United States welcomes the renewal of resolution 2498 (2019) under the United Nations sanctions regime for Somalia, as well as its extension of the mandate of the Panel of Experts on Somalia and the provisions of the arms embargo for a further 12 months. The authorities in this resolution are an important part of the United Nations arms embargo, which every Council member has committed to upholding in the interest of securing peace and stability both in Somalia and in the broader region. To that end, we also support the increased focus on thwarting Al-Shabaab's exploitation of the financial system, and the addition of humanitarian language in the resolution. These elements draw attention to necessary reporting and urge the Somali authorities to address sexual and gender- based violence in Somalia with renewed strength. The United States remains committed to promoting the security and prosperity of the people of Somalia.
