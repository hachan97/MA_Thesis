Mr. Bessho (Japan): Japan wecomes the swift
adoption of presidential statement S/PRST/2017/ 16,
strongly condemning the most recent ballistic missile
launched by North Korea, which flew over Japan, and
also demanding that North Korea immediately cease all
such actions. This demonstrates the unity ofthe Security
Council and sends a strong and clear message to North
Korea that the international community will not accept
its reckless behaviour. We urge North Korea to respond
immediately to this call by the international community.

Japan will continue to work very closely with
Council members and all other Member States to reach
a comprehensive solution to the problems related to
North Korea.
