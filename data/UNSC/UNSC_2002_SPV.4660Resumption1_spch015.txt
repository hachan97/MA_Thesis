The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter dated
10 December 2002 from the Permanent Observer of
Palestine to the United Nations, which will be issued as
document S/2002/1346, and which reads as follows,

"I have the honour to request that, in
accordance with its previous practice, the
Security Council invite the Permanent Observer
of Palestine to the United Nations to participate
in the meeting of the Security Council being held
today, Tuesday, 10 December 2002, on the report
of the Secretary-General to the Security Council
on the protection of civilians in armed conflict."

I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite the Permanent Observer of Palestine to
participate in the current debate, in accordance with the
rules of procedure and the previous practice in this
regard.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite the Permanent Observer of Palestine to
take the seat reserved for him at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Cambodia. I invite him to take a seat
at the Council table and to make his statement.
