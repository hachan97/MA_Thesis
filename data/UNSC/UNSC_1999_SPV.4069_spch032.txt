Mr. Dangue Rewaka (Gabon) (spoke in French):
Allow us first, Mr. President, to associate ourselves with
your tribute to the United Nations staff members who
perished in last week's plane crash in Kosovo and to
extend our condolences to their families.

The delegation of Gabon would like to thank you,
Sir, for extending an invitation to the three Members of
the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which enabled
them to report to the Security Council today on the
progress achieved in the implementation of the Dayton
Agreements and on the action still to be taken. Their
presence here in the Council shows their determination to
put an end to the problems underlying the difficulties
faced by the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We
encourage them to redouble their efforts so that the
pending issues may be dealt with rapidly, thereby
consolidating peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The
Declaration they have just adopted during their stay in
New York is an important step, and we congratulate them
on it. We urge the international community to continue to
help them actively in their reconstruction efforts to bring
about a new, united, strong and prosperous Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
