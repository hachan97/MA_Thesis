The President (spoke in Chinese): There are no
further speakers on my list. It is my understanding that
the Council is ready to proceed to the adoption of its
annual report.

May I take it that the draft report is adopted by
the Council?

There being no objection, it is so decided.

This decision will be reflected in a note by the
President of the Security Council to be issued as
document S/2008/678.

The Security Council has thus concluded its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 10.25 am.
