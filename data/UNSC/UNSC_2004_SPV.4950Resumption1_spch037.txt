Ms. Al-Mulla (Kuwait): While my delegation
associates itself with the statement made by Malaysia
on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)
countries, it also welcomes and lends its moral and
political support to the draft resolution. We would like
to highlight the following points.

It is of the utmost importance that we continue to
strengthen multilateral institutions and fully implement
international treaties dealing with issues of
disarmament and non-proliferation, which we consider
mutually reinforcing processes. All Security Council
resolutions are legally binding on Member States, in
accordance with Article 25 of the Charter. We agree
that a gap exists within the international treaty regime,
which does not address the nexus between weapons of
mass destruction and non-State actors.

This draft resolution could be an interim solution
until that gap is addressed fully at a later stage. We also
believe that the nature of this draft resolution, as well
as possible future actions, should be based on a broad
consensus in the international community. It is well
known that we have our own regional concerns on this
issue, but we stress that other regions have
responsibilities and obligations with regard to non-
State actors and weapons of mass destruction. This
issue is a collective responsibility that requires
cooperation and commitment by one and all.

Lastly, Kuwait will cooperate fully in the
implementation of this draft resolution once it is
adopted.
