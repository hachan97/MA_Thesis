The President: At this point, I would like to thank in
particular the colleagues from Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Portugal, Germany, Turkey and Italy for their very kind
words addressed to me and my country.

I shall now give the floor to Mr. Annabi to respond to
some of the comments and questions raised. Of course, I
shall also offer the representative of Bosnia and
Herzegovina the floor to respond to any questions to
which he may wish to respond.
