The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the
representative of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya for his
kind words addressed to me.

I would like to say to the members of the Council
and the other delegations that there are more speakers
on my list. Given the lateness of the hour, at the end of
this long day, with the consent of the members of the
Council I would like to suspend meeting now. It will
resume tomorrow, Tuesday, 21 August, at 3 pm.

The meeting was suspended at 6.55 pm.
