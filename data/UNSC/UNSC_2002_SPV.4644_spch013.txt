Ms. Lee (Singapore): On 17 October, in the
Security Council's open debate on the situation
between Iraq and Kuwait, Singapore spelled out
comprehensively its position on this issue. We voted in
favour of resolution 1441 (2002), as it is consistent
with the positions that we have espoused in the
Security Council.

In April 1991, the Council adopted resolution 687
(1991), which provided a comprehensive framework to
secure peace and maintain the security of the region.
One critical element was the requirement that Iraq fully
disarm itself of its weapons of mass destruction. It is
clear that Iraq has not complied with resolution 687
(1991) and subsequent resolutions. There is a clear
international consensus that Iraq must comply with this
Council's resolutions, which it has hitherto defied. As
the Secretary-General told the General Assembly on 12
September and reiterated in his compelling statement
today,

"If Iraq's defiance continues... the Security
Council must face its responsibilities".

The unanimous adoption of resolution 1441
(2002) today is a clear message to Iraq from the
Council. The key objective of this resolution is to set
up an enhanced inspection regime to bring to full and
verified completion the disarmament process begun by
resolution 687 (1991). It makes clear that Iraq will be
given a full and final opportunity to comply with its
disarmament obligations under the relevant resolutions
of the Security Council.
The difference between successful and
unsuccessful inspections may be the difference
between peace and war. We hope that Iraq will make its
decision carefully.
