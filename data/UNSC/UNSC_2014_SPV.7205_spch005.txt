The President (spoke in Russian): I thank
Mr. Simonovie for his briefing. Mr. Simonovie has
asked for my leave to depart. I cannot deny it, as he has
given his briefing to the Security Council. Given that
he has an urgent reason, we will indeed grant that leave.
I would be grateful if one of his assistants could listen
in to our discussion.

I shall now give the floor to the members of the
Security Council.
