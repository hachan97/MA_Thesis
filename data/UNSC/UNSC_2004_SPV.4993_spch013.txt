The President: I thank the representative of
France for highlighting the participation of
representatives of civil society in our deliberations. I
also note your reference to the great work of Medecins
sans Frontieres, which I think everyone here
recognizes. We note the questions you have raised, as
we begin to think of the interplay of the various actors
in peace-building. We look forward to looking into the
proposals contained in your paper.
