Ms. Guadey (Ethiopia): We would also like to
congratulate our colleagues from the United Kingdom
for their professionalism and efficient manner in
presiding over the Security Council. Allow me to
congratulate you as well, Madam President, for
assuming the presidency of the Council for the month
of September, a difficult month but we are sure that
you will fly through. We look forward to engaging
constructively in the meetings and would like to assure
you of our full support.

However, we would like to echo some concerns
raised by some members of the Security Council on the
agenda item scheduled for 5 September, as we think that
the situation in Nicaragua does not constitute a threat
to international peace and security. It would therefore
be very difficult for us to support the inclusion of the
agenda item in the provisional programme of work.
