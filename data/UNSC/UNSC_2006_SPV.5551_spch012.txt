Mr. Bolton (United States of America): I am not
going to waste any of our time responding to what the
representative of the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea said, but I want to call members' attention to
that empty chair. This is the second time in three
months that the representative of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea, having asked to
participate in our meetings, has rejected a unanimous
resolution of the Security Council and walked out of
06-57213
this Chamber. It is the contemporary equivalent of
Nikita Khrushchev pounding his shoe on the rostrum of
the General Assembly.

That empty chair raises questions about the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea's adherence to
Chapter II of the United Nations Charter, which I think
we need to consider in due course.
