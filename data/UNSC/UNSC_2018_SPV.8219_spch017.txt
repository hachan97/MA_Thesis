Mr. Radomski (Poland): Let me first thank
Mr. Taye-Brook Zerihoun, Assistant Secretary-General
for Political Affairs and Acting Under-Secretary-
General for Political Affairs.

Along with the delegations of the United States
and the United Kingdom, I would like also to note
the fact that the representative of Israel unfortunately
could not participate in this meeting because of the
Passover holiday.

We are following the latest developments in the
Gaza Strip with great concern. Unfortunately, recent
events have only confirmed how tense the security
situation in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory
is. We strongly condemn the current escalation of
violence. We also emphasize that any use of force should
be proportional. We call for respect of international
humanitarian law and the protection of civilians.

Poland condemns all acts of terrorism and
incitement to violence. They constitute a significant
obstacle to the de-escalation of tensions. We called on
both parties to condemn all acts of terror. At the same
time, we encourage the parties to the conflict to take
actions aimed at de-escalating tensions and calming the
situation on the ground.
