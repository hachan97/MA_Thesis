Mr. Pompeo (United States ofAmerica): The focus
of the Security Council is to safeguard international
peace and security. The former Maduro regime
oppressed its people for years, forcing millions of
Venezuelans to flee the country merely to gain very
basic access to food and water. That has overwhelmed
the capacity of regional countries to adequately address
the urgent humanitarian needs. Former President
Maduro bears full responsibility for that tragedy,
allowing Venezuelans to languish without food and
humanitarian assistance.

On 10 January, the Organization of American
States (OAS) passed a resolution that refused to
recognize the illegitimate Maduro regime and called
for further attention to address the suffering of the
Venezuelan people. Last week, we all received a letter
under Article 54 of the Charter of the United Nations
from OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro Lemes,
which specifically described the destabilizing impact
ofthis crisis on the region. And yet, despite this tragedy
and despite the calls from regional bodies for it to be
given more attention, the United Nations has yet to hold
a formal meeting on this subject.

We now have a new leader, Juan Guaido, in
Venezuela, who has promised to bring elections and
constitutional order back to Venezuela and security
back to the region. We cannot delay this critical
conversation, which has the world's attention. For the
sake of Venezuela and the region, we must support the
Venezuelan people and do so right now.
