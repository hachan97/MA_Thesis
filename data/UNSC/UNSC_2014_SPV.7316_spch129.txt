Mr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Given the lateness of the hour, I shall make
only a brief comment.

Some delegations in today's meeting have made
inappropriate allusions to, and interpretations of,
matters that have nothing to do with the topic under
consideration. We believe that this distracts members
from the Council's discussion of the dangerous threat
posed by terrorism and from the options for collectively
countering it, which is our subject today. We suggest
that the Security Council be used not for sharing random
ideas but for participating in constructive discussions
on agenda items.
