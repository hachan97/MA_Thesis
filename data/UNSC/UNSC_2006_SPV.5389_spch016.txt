Mr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): Allow
me at the outset to welcome the presence of Mrs. Ellen
Johnson-Sirleaf here today. We are pleased indeed at
the success story of the Security Council and the
international community in the restoration of peace to
West Africa. It is our hope that Liberia will be an
example to be followed in that region with regard to
peace processes.

We welcome the presence among us of the
African continent's first elected woman President and
the first Liberian head of State to have been elected
since the civil war ended in 2003. Mrs. Johnson-Sirleaf
was elected through fair and transparent elections that
put an end to the transition period in Liberia. She is
indeed a living example of the important role of
women in the processes of political decision-making,
peacebuilding and conflict resolution.
The devastation wrought by the destructive civil
war in that country makes it incumbent upon us to
consider ways and means of assisting the Liberian
people, who have suffered so much in the recent past.
In that regard, we call on the donor countries to
support the efforts of Mrs. Johnson-Sirleaf in
combating corruption and in the reconstruction of the
infrastructure in Liberia, which has gone beyond the
stage of peacekeeping to that of peacebuilding.

The State of Qatar appreciates the efforts of the
United Nations and of the international community in
Liberia, in particular those of the United Nations
Mission in Liberia, whose role has been vital in the
establishment of peace in Liberia, which will have a
positive impact on the West African region as a whole.
I should like to wish every success to President
J ohnson-Sirleaf and to her friendly country.
