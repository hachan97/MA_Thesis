The President: I thank Ms. Cliffe for her
comprehensive briefing.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council Members, I should like to remind all
speakers to limit their statements to no more than five
minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its
work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy
statements are kindly requested to circulate texts in
writing and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking in the Chamber.
