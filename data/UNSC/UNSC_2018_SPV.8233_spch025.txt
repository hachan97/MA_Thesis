Mr. Skoog (Sweden): We voted against the draft
resolution submitted by the Russian Federation
(S/2018/355) because we believe that its language was
unbalanced. It was not comprehensive and failed to
address all of our concerns about the current situation.
At the same time, we agree with the Secretary-General
that actions must be consistent with the Charter of the
United Nations and with international law in general.

In our national statement delivered earlier today,
we explained our view on the current situation in
Syria and condemned the use of chemical weapons
and the many other flagrant violations of international
law in Syria. We also underscore the importance of
a sustainable political solution. As members of the
Security Council, we reiterate that we must unite and
exercise our responsibility with regard to the situation
in Syria.

If there is any encouragement today, it is that it
appears that everyone around the table insists on a
sustainable political solution as the only way to end
the suffering of the Syrian population. We therefore
reiterate our full support for the United Nations political
process, which must now be urgently reinvigorated,
including through strong support for the efforts of
Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura.
