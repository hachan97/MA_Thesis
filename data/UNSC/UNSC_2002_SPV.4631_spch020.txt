The President (spoke in French): I would like to
now ask some questions in my capacity as the
representative of Cameroon. First of all, I am pleased
to welcome Lord Paddy Ashdown and Mr. Jacques
Klein. I would like to thank them in particular for the
useful, detailed and informative briefings.

I have two questions for them. First, how did the
other countries in the subregion view the results of the
5 October elections? And secondly, with the future
coalition, will there be continued international
cooperation in combating organized crime, trafficking
and the lack of security?

I would like to praise the work of Mr. Jacques
Paul Klein as the head of the United Nations Mission
in Bosnia and Herzegovina. His dedication and
professionalism have enabled the international
community to set Bosnia and Herzegovina on the road
to recovery and to integration into the community of
free and independent States.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

The next speaker on my list is the representative
of Denmark. I invite her to take a seat at the Council
table and to make her statement.
