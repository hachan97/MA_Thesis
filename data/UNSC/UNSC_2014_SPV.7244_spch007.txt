The President: I thank Mr. Karokhail for his
briefing.

I shall now give the floor to the members of the
Security Council.

In accordance with provisions of the note S/2010/507,
which encourages both members and non-members of
the Council to deliver their statements in five minutes
or less, it is our intention to use the flashing light on
the collar of the speaker's microphone to indicate when
the five minutes have elapsed. I strongly encourage
members of the Council to conclude their remarks
promptly once the five minutes have elapsed.
