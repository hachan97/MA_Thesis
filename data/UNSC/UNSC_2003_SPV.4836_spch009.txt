Sir Emyr Jones Parry (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland): I would like to use
this occasion to offer you every best wish for your
presidency, Mr. President, as well as to affirm the
United Kingdom's commitment to offer you every
support.

This is the first meeting since the Haifa bombing,
so I must begin by condemning strongly the actions
that took place yesterday, and to express our
condolences to the families of those killed and maimed.
I note that Islamic Jihad has claimed responsibility for
that action.
Let me be clear that Israel's action today is
unacceptable and represents an escalation. Israel
should not allow its justified anger at continuing
terrorism to lead to actions that undermine both the
peace process and, we believe, Israel's own interests.
But we have to recognize that terrorists are continuing
to attack Israel and that they are being permitted to do
so. There is a heavy responsibility on all those who are
in a position to act against terrorism to do so. That has
been affirmed by the Security Council many times, and
perhaps most clearly in resolution 1373 (2001).

Allowing impunity to those committed to using
terror as a political instrument serves only to
undermine peace and to prevent progress in the Middle
East peace process. The United Kingdom believes that
lasting security can only be assured by a successful
peace process, as was stressed at the conclusion of the
Quartet meeting held here in New York on 25
September. We believe that all sides should exercise
restraint and now reinforce their efforts to implement
the road map. In the next day, the Security Council
should do all it can to help bring that about. We will all
have to reflect carefully on the best message we can
now send in order that we reinforce the prospects of the
road map, and do so at a precarious moment in the
Middle East.
