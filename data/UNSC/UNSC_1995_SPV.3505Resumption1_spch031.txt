Mr. Jemat (Brunei Darussalam): First, may I offer
my congratulations to you, Sir, on your assumption of the
presidency of the Security Council for the month of
February.

Although Brunei Darussalam sees many of the recent
changes in the Middle East as a welcome sign of long-
overdue progress, we are concerned by reports of new
programmes of Israeli settlement in the occupied
territories. Such moves can only increase tension by
heightening animosity between Palestinians and Israelis,
with possible grave potential consequences.
We understand that achieving a comprehensive peace
will be a difficult task. We therefore urge the Israelis to
stop the establishment, construction and planning of such
settlements anywhere in all the occupied territories,
including those in and around Jerusalem. We believe that
it is as much in the interest of Israel as of Palestine to see
that the peace process be implemented in full and without
delay. For this reason, we feel that the settlements serve
to undermine not only the confidence of the Palestinian
population in general, but the whole peace process.

We encourage all parties to proceed in the spirit of
the Madrid Conference and the Declaration of Principles
on Interim Self-Government Arrangements signed
between the PLO and Israel, and to commit themselves
resolutely to the challenge of peace throughout the Middle
East.
