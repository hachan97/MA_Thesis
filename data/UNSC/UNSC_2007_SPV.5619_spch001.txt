The President (spoke in Russian): I Should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Myanmar in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Kyaw Tint
Swe (Myanmar) took a seat at the Council table.

The President (spoke in Russian): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2007/ 14, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of
America. I should like to draw attention to an oral
addition to the fourth preambular paragraph in the
revised version: after the word "UNAIDS", the words
"United Nations Development Programme" should be
added.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution, as orally
revised. Unless I hear any objection I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the
voting.
