The President (interpretation from Chinese): I thank
the representative of the Central African Republic for his
kind words addressed to me.

It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/ 1997/849) before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put the
draft resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:

Chile, China, Costa Rica, Egypt, France, Guinea-
Bissau, Japan, Kenya, Poland, Portugal, Republic of
Korea, Russian Federation, Sweden, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America

The President (interpretation from Chinese): There
were 15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 1136 (1997).

There are no further speakers inscribed on my list.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council will remain seized of the matter.

The meeting rose at 12.30 pm.
