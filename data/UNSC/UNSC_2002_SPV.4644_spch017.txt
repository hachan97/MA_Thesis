Mr. Gokool (Mauritius): Mauritius has voted in
favour of this resolution, as it is the fruit of intense and
constructive negotiations, which took on board all
concerns raised by members of the Security Council.
We are pleased to see the clear and unambiguous role
of the Security Council in the maintenance and
promotion of international peace and security through
peaceful means.

Mauritius considers that a unanimous vote in
favour of this resolution strengthens further unity of
the Council, which is the prerequisite for the effective
implementation of this resolution, as well as all other
Council resolutions. In that regard, we hope that Iraq
will comply with the collective wish of the
international community. We call on all Council and
non-Council members to help in the implementation of
this resolution. At the same time, we reaffirm our full
trust in Mr. Blix and Mr. ElBaradei and the staff of the
United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection
Commission and the International Atomic Energy
Agency, and are confident that they will carry out their
mandate in the most professional manner. Lastly, we
once again salute the special efforts of our Secretary-
General in that regard.
