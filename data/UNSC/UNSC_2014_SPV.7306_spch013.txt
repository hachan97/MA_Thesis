Mr. Cai Weiming (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
wish to thank Ms. Bensouda for her briefing.

China is deeply worried at the worsening situation
in Libya. The priority for the time being is for the parties
in Libya to place the interests of their country and
people first, comply with relevant Council resolutions
and the commitments made at the Ghadames dialogue,
immediately reach a ceasefire and resolve their
differences through inclusive political dialogue so as
to restore the security and stability of their country as
soon as possible. That is the precondition for and the
foundation upon which to achieve justice in Libya.

China's position on matters involving the
International Criminal Court remains unchanged.
