The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as representative of the United Kingdom.

The United Kingdom warmly welcomes the
unanimous adoption of resolution 2249 (2015). Today,
we sent a clear, unambiguous message that there will be
no respite in our collective efforts to stop, suppress and
destroy the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).
Whether in the streets of Paris or Beirut or in the skies
above the Sinai, ISIL's brutality knows no bounds and
respects no borders. ISIL's determination to carry out
attacks around the world must be met by our greater
resolve to defeat them wherever we find them.

Too many Security Council members here today,
and too many other United Nations Member States,
have experienced ISIL's callous disregard for life. Our
welcome unity today shows that we shall not be deterred
in our efforts to prevent such attacks from happening
again. As my Security Council colleagues have said,
this resolution is a powerful international recognition
of the threat ISIL poses. It calls for lawful action and
all necessary measures to counter ISIL.

Like others, the United Kingdom has already
taken action against ISIL on the basis of individual and
collective self-defence, as we have set out to the Council.
The Council has put in place extensive obligations for
States to take action against ISIL, to stop the travel of
foreign terrorist fighters and to choke off their funding.
The recent attacks and resolution 2249 (2015) remind
us that these measures must be implemented if the
international response to ISIL is to succeed.

In conclusion, we stand in solidarity with the
people of France and we commend France for its
leadership on this resolution. As the Security Council
presidency, we are proud that the Security Council has
acted with speed, unity and clarity of purpose to agree
this powerful call to action.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

The meeting rose at 6.15 pm.
