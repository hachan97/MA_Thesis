Mr. Adejola (Nigeria): I thank Ambassador
Oyarzun Marchesi for his briefing and we commend
the Panel of Experts for their work.

As this is the first meeting of the Council on the
subject after the adoption of resolution 2231 (2015), we
would like to reiterate our support for the agreement
between Iran and the P5+1 on the Iranian nuclear
programme. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,
endorsed by resolution 2231 (2015), presents a clear
road map for the implementation of the agreement. It
is our hope that it will lead to an early resolution of all
outstanding issues in Iran's nuclear programme.

We support dialogue, diplomacy and the resolution
of crises through such agreements. In view of this,
we urge the parties to implement the agreement
transparently, in good faith and for the progress of
the people of Iran. We further welcome the continued
cooperation of the Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1737 (2006) with members. This is vital to
upholding and ensuring the integrity of the sanctions
regime.

Finally, let me commend the Chair of the
Committee for his astute leadership and assure him of
our continued support.
