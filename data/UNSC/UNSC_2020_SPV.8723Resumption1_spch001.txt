The President (spoke in French): I wish to remind all speakers to limit their statements to no more than four minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with longer statements are kindly requested to circulate their texts in writing and to deliver a summarized version when speaking in the Chamber. The red light on the collar of the microphone will begin to flash after four minutes have elapsed. I now give the floor to the representative Lebanon.
