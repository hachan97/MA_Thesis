Mr. Seck (Senegal) (spoke in French): The
Senegalese delegation welcomes the adoption of
resolution 2393 (2017), renewing for 12 months
the mandate of the mechanism for the cross-border
delivery of humanitarian aid to thousands of innocent
Syrian victims in need. For that reason, the Senegalese
delegation congratulates the penholder delegations
of Sweden, Egypt and Japan. We also commend all
other delegations that contributed positively to the
proposed amendments.

The mechanism, of course, could be improved. In
that regard, we await the review to be conducted by the
Secretary-General. In the meantime, it is essential that
the resolution take into account the fact that millions
of Syrians remain victims and in need of humanitarian

assistance. We are interested to hear what Mr. Lowcock
and especially Mr. Staffan de Mistura will have to
say with respect to the political process, given that
resolution 2254 (2015) and the Geneva communique
(8/2012/522, annex) are yet to be fully implemented.

The meeting rose at 10.45 aJn.
