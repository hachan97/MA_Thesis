The President (spoke in Chinese): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Following consultations among members of the
Council, I have been authorized to make the following
statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council expresses its grave
concern at renewed fighting between Ugandan and
Rwandan forces in Kisangani, Democratic Republic of
the Congo, which began on 5 May 2000. The Council
endorses the statement made by its Mission to the
Democratic Republic of the Congo on 5 May 2000 in
Kinshasa calling for an immediate halt to the fighting.

"The Security Council condemns unreservedly
the outbreak of military hostilities in Kisangani. This
renewed fighting is, once more, threatening the
implementation of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement
(S/l999/815). The Council is also concerned by
reports of the killing of innocent Congolese
civilians.

"The Security Council demands that these latest
hostilities cease immediately and that those involved
in the fighting at Kisangani reaffirm their
commitment to the Lusaka process and comply with
all relevant Security Council resolutions. The
Council reaffirms its commitment to the national
sovereignty, territorial integrity and political
independence of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo.

"The Security Council considers that this
violent action directly violates the Lusaka
Agreement; the 8 April 2000 Kampala
Disengagement Plan; the 14 April 2000 ceasefire;
the subsequent written instructions to field
commanders to abide by this ceasefire; and relevant
Security Council resolutions.
"The Security Council will remain actively
seized of the matter."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2000/ 15.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.

The meeting rose at 2.35 p.m.
