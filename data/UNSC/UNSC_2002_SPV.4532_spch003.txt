The President: On behalf of the Council I should
like to express gratitude and appreciation to all of the
members of the Security Council mission, which was
very ably led by Ambassador Levitte, for the manner in
which they discharged their important responsibility on
the Council's behalf. My only personal regret is that I
was not able to join the mission, because I was
detained here by my duties as President of the Security
Council.

The next speaker on my list is the representative
of Spain. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table
and to make his statement.
