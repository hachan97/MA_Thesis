Ms. Davis (United Kingdom): We would also like
to thank Assistant Secretary-General Tiirk for his
briefing this morning. We also join others in expressing
our appreciation for the work of the United Nations
Political Office in Bougainville (UNPOB) and its
director Noel Sinclair. We also recognize the valuable
role in Bougainville of the neighbouring States.

We agree with Assistant Secretary-General Turk
and others that there is still work to be done in
advancing the peace process in Bougainville,
particularly in the areas of weapons disposal,
monitoring and building confidence in the new
constitutional arrangements and facilitating moves
towards elections. In the forthcoming period, we hope
to see a greater sense of urgency from all parties to the
Bougainville peace process in moving forward in those
areas. We support the establishment of a small, closely-
focused, short-term follow-on United Nations mission
along the lines outlined this morning by Assistant
Secretary-General Turk.
