The President: I again thank our three briefers very
much. It was extremely useful to hear about progress on
the women and peace and security agenda in Iraq. Iraq
is something of a regional leader in this, but obviously
there are many challenges. We thank the International
Committee of the Red Cross for all the important
work it is doing with respect to missing persons. I also
extend a huge thank you to the Special Representative
and his team in the United Nations Assistance Mission
for Iraq for all their efforts in helping to stabilize Iraq
still further.

I now invite Council members to informal
consultations to continue our discussion on the subject.

The meeting rose at I] am.
