Mr. Maquieira (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): The
delegation of Chile voted in favour of this resolution
because we share its philosophy regarding respect for
the sovereignty, territorial integrity and the internal
political process of States. Our support is also justified
by the important amendments made to the original text,
which made it possible to overcome some of the
primary basic objections that our delegation had and
which brought the resolution into line with my
country's position of principle.

At the same time, the delegation of Chile wishes
to state that this resolution in fact means once again a
double standard in the Middle East conflict, as
demonstrated by the sad lack of political will to deal
with Israel's occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, and
the Golan. It is also of concern that there is no mention
of the peace plan, which Chile believes is the only
viable mechanism for negotiations that can reduce
tensions in the region and lead to a just and lasting
peace in the Middle East.
