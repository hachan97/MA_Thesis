Viet Nam welcomes the recent positive developments in the Sudan. We especially commend the efforts of the Transitional Government in promoting peace, stability and development in the country and in responding to the coronavirus disease pandemic, as well as those of the United Nations, the African Union and the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur in supporting this process. We are pleased to see that the security situation in the Sudan in general and in Darfur in particular has become largely stable. Given the potential complexities of the situation, we hope that the Security Council and the international community will remain united and supportive of the Sudan. Viet Nam welcomes and affirms the establishment of the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in the Sudan (UNITAMS) as necessary and well founded. The establishment of a United Nations political mission under Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter, as compared with a peacekeeping mission - the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, under Chapter VI - is an encouraging turning point. We would like to stress that UNITAMS should operate in full respect of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Sudan and in close consultation with its Government. Viet Nam counts on the continued cooperation of the African Union and the United Nations as well as their support for UNITAMS in fulfilling its mandate. We would also like to express our appreciation to the co-penholders for their efforts and constructive engagement with Council members during the negotiations. We are very pleased that resolution 2524 (2020) has been adopted unanimously, which will send a positive message to the Government and the people of the Sudan.
