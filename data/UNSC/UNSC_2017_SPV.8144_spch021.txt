Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian):
We encourage the representative of the Ukraine to
respect the Security Council and its members. We do
not want to get into a senseless polemic, but Ukraine's
latest comments run contrary to common sense and
force us to once again take the floor.

From the beginning of the conflict in the
Ukraine - which was a direct consequence of the
unconstitutional seizure of power by those on the
Maidan, which the citizens of Donetsk and Luhansk
did not recognize - we have time and again heard
in various forums about Russian intervention and
aggression in the conflict.

However, there was and is no proof of those
allegations. But there is proof of a number of Violations
of international law by the Ukrainian party. Those
facts are regularly published by representatives of the
United Nations and other international organizations.
What is the point of the endless bombardment, despite
all of the statements and warnings from humanitarian
groups on the threats of large-scale humanitarian and
natural disasters? We consider those activities by
the authorities in Kyiv as inhuman, in making use of
schemes to make sure that they get their pensions and
social contributions.

How many more schools and hospitals do they
need to destroy before they address the situation at the
negotiating table and deal with the issue of terrorists?
We repeat that the road map was drawn up in the Minsk
agreements; it just need to be implemented.
