The President: I thank the representative of
Israel for his kind words about Viet Nam's presidency
of the Security Council.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I should like to remind all
speakers to limit their statements to no more than five
minutes, in order to enable the Council to carry out its
work expeditiously. Speakers with lengthy statements
are kindly requested to circulate their texts in the
Chamber and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking.
