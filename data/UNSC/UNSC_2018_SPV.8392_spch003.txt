The President (spoke in Chinese): I thank Mr. Inzko
for his briefing.

The Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the
draft resolution before it.

Members of the Council have before them document

S/2018/989, which contains the text of a draft resolution

submitted by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland.

I now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the vote.
