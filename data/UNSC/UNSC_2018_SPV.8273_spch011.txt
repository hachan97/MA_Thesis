Mr. Llorentty Soliz (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): Committed as it is to the people
of South Sudan and to the political process led by the
relevant regional organizations, Bolivia would like to
explain its vote today.

Our abstention in the voting on resolution 2418
(2018) responds to specific elements that were not taken
into account by the penholders with respect to the list
of persons identified in the annex, which had been
brought to their attention by several delegations. As
we have said before on several occasions, we supports
the legal waiting period before adopting measures,
including sanctions measures, against those who violate
cessation of hostilities agreements and obstruct peace
processes. Such decisions, which are relevant not only
for South Sudan but also for the region, must be agreed
in principle in conjunction with the relevant regional
and subregional organizations.

We would like to also express our concern that the
resolution was not adopted by unanimity. The Security
Council is not sending the right message. We believe
that the Council should stay united behind the political
process led by the Intergovernmental Authority on
Development (IGAD). Of course, today's decision
weakens that position.

Finally, we welcome the IGAD Council ofMinisters
communique' issued after the meeting held today in
Addis Ababa. We reiterate that the only solution to this
conflict is through the political process currently being
led by IGAD.
