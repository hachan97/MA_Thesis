Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese):
We thank Mr. Rashid Khalikov, Director of the Office
for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA),
for his briefing today. China has closely followed the

humanitarian situation in Darfur. We look forward to
the report to be submitted by the joint OCHA-
Government of the Sudan assessment teams, which
will give us a better understanding of the overall
humanitarian situation in Darfur. It is our hope that the
parties concerned will work together to seek and
achieve an early resolution of the crisis and thereby
ensure the unimpeded provision of humanitarian
assistance to Darfur.

The issue of Darfur is multifaceted and complex.
It encompasses such areas as the political process, the
deployment of peacekeepers, humanitarian relief,
justice and economic reconstruction. All activities in
these fields are inextricably interrelated. Recent events
have shown that the issuance by the International
Criminal Court of an arrest warrant for the Sudanese
President has already adversely affected the situation in
Darfur. It is our hope that the parties concerned will
exercise restraint in order to prevent the escalation of
tensions and avoid a further negative impact on the
political process, the deployment of peacekeepers and
the provision of humanitarian assistance in Darfur.

We maintain that the Security Council should
have a comprehensive discussion of the issue of Darfur
in order to develop an integrated strategy and to
advance in a balanced manner in its work to find a
comprehensive solution to the issue.
