Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We are not playing political games here. On
the other hand, perhaps we are, because if we were not
playing political games, we would not be having this
discussion today. But while we have studied this issue,
and the Council's practice on it varies. we will not delve
into that at the moment, as we see no purpose in getting
mired in procedural discussions. We merely ask that
you, Mr. President, put the question to a procedural
vote. We propose that the Russian draft resolution
(S/2017/933) be put to the vote second, after the draft
resolution submitted by the United States (S/2017/962).
