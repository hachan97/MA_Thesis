Mrs. Bogyay (Hungary): First of all, I thank
Germany for organizing such an important open
debate. I thank the briefers and the representatives of
the Observer State of Palestine and Israel for their very
important contributions.

In line with most of the international community,
Hungary still considers the two-State formula the best
solution to the seven-decade Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
as no credible alternatives have been put forward that
address both the legitimate security concerns and the
aspiration to statehood by both parties. Over the past
three months, however, with Israel having elections and
the Palestinian factions still not able to resolve their
differences and unite, we saw no progress regarding the
relaunching of the negotiations between the parties.

We believe that in the current stalemate the
international community should play a positive role
in facilitating the relaunch of negotiations. In that
regard, Hungary's awaits the presentation of the United
States peace plan with hope. At the same time, we find
it important to stress that the Israeli and Palestinian
leaders should understand that long-lasting peace
requires difficult compromises by both sides. On the
one hand, their task is to arrive at such compromises
and, on the other hand, to convince their peoples to
accept them. We hope that all sides will agree to engage
in a renewed dialogue in good faith. As a member of the
European Union, we will continue working to achieve
peace and stability in the Middle East region.
