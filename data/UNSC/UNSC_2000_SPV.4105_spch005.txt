Mr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): We thank Mr. Bildt
for his very frank, thorough and engaging briefing on
Balkan issues. It could not have been timelier, as the
recent incidents in the Balkans, and in Kosovo in
particular, have made us freshly focus our attention on the
international efforts for peace in the region as a whole.
We appreciate this firsthand briefing on Balkan issues
from a veteran such as Mr. Bildt.

 

The recent flare-up in Mitrovica has been viewed as
potentially destabilizing for other areas of Kosovo and
beyond. Mr. Bildt has long been championing a far more
intensive involvement on the part of the international
community in reconstruction - not just in Kosovo and
Bosnia, but also across the Balkans as a whole. We agree
with his statement today that the time is now ripe for
discussions on all unresolved core issues in the Balkans.

The international community has reinforced its
presence to prevent inter-ethnic clashes. This has
contributed, to some extent, to a calming of the situation.
But experience shows that conflicts rooted in ethnicity tend
to be prolonged and even to transcend generations. The
strengthened international presence cannot be a permanent
solution. There should be a built-in mechanism within their
societies which would check and halt any flaring up of
hostile situations.

We should help promote a culture of peace in the
Balkans with determined efforts and with the involvement
and participation of all sectors of their societies. An all-
embracing movement by civil society for a culture of peace
is possibly the only way to achieve sustainable stability in
the region.
