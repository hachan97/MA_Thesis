The President (spoke in French): I thank the
representative of the United States for his kind words
addressed to me.

Before giving the floor to the next speaker, I
should like to say that I intend to go through the entire
list of speakers. Therefore, after members of the
Council, I will give the floor to the other countries that
are inscribed.
