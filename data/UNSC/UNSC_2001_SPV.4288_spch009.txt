The President: I cannot agree more with the
understanding of the representative of Japan about the
need for active involvement of the General Assembly,
as well as other organs of the United Nations system, in
the discussion on strengthening the Organization's
capabilities in the maintenance of international peace
and security.

The next speaker on my list is the representative
of Argentina. I invite him to take a seat at the Council
table and to make his statement.
