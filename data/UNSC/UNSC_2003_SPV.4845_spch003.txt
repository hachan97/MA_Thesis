The President: On behalf of the Council, I thank
Ambassador Arias for his comprehensive briefing and
for his leadership of the Counter-Terrorism Committee.

I would also like to make a procedural comment.
There remain on the speakers' list the members of the
Council and 19 non-members. Ambassador Pleuger has
graciously agreed to postpone this afternoon's meeting
to prepare the Afghanistan trip until 10.30 tomorrow
morning, in order to free up time for us to continue this
important discussion today. We will therefore break for
lunch a little after 1 p.m. and then resume at 3 p.m.
sharp to continue the discussion.
