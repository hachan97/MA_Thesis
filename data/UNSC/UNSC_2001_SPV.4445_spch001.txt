The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

The monthly wrap-up meeting is an opportunity
for members of the Council to take stock at the end of
the month, to review what they have done and,
possibly, to mention the results the Council has been
able to achieve. By establishing these monthly reviews,
the Council has given itself a tool that enables it to
continuously rationalize and improve the way it carries
out the tasks assigned to it by the Charter of the United
Nations. It should make full use of the that tool's
potential.

I now invite members to proceed to an interactive
and constructive exchange of views.
