The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2009/641, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by China, France, the
Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States
America.

I should also like to draw the attention of
participants to the report of the Secretary-General on
the United Nations operation in Cyprus, which has
been issued as document 8/2009/609, and to the report
of the Secretary-General on his mission of good offices
in Cyprus, which has been issued as document
S/2009/610.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I should like to inform the Council that the presidency
of the Council has met with the representatives of the
parties, who maintain their well-known positions
vis-a-vis the item on the Council's agenda. On the
basis of those meetings, with the consent of the
members of the Council, the presidency has drawn the
conclusion that the Council can proceed to take a
decision of the draft resolution before it. Unless I hear
any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the
vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by Show of hands.

In favour:
Austria, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, Japan, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,
Mexico, Russian Federation, Uganda, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America, Viet Nam

Against:
Turkey

The President (spoke in French): There were
14 votes in favour and one against. The draft resolution
has been adopted as resolution 1898 (2009).

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements after the voting.
