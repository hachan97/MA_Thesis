The President: Before adjourning the meeting, as
this is the last scheduled meeting of the Council for
the month of July, I would like to express the sincere
appreciation of the delegation of Japan to the members
of the Council, especially my colleagues the Permanent
Representatives and their respective staffs, and the
Secretariat of the Council for all the support they have
given to us.

Indeed, it has been a busy month and one in
which we rallied to consensus on several important
issues within our purview. We could not have done it
alone or without the hard work, support and positive
contributions of every delegation and the representatives
of the Secretariat, as well as the interpreters, sound
technicians, security staff and other relevant conference
service officers. As we end our presidency, I know I
speak on behalf of the Council in wishing the delegation
of Malaysia all the best in the month of August.

The meeting rose at 6.15 pm.
