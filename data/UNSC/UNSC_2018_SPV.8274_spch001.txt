to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Security

Joanna Wronecka, Permanent Representative of Poland
to the United Nations, for her service as President of

appreciation to Ambassador Wronecka and her team for
the great diplomatic skill with which they conducted
the Council's business last month.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its consideration
