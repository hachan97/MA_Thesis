The President (spoke in French): I thank Lord
Ashdown for the clarifications he provided.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

I wish, on behalf of the Security Council, to thank
Lord Ashdown and Mr. Adnan Terzic for having taken
the time to meet with the Council.

The meeting rose at 1.10pm.
