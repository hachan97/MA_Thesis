Mr. Oh Joon (Republic of Korea): The Republic of
Korea welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution
2139 (2014). This resolution is a new landmark in the
Council's work but also one that is long overdue. For
nearly three years, the humanitarian crisis in Syria
has deteriorated while the Council has been seemingly
unable to take proper action to provide relief to the long
suffering of the Syrian people. Hopefully, our unity
today will ensure the Council's effective role in dealing
with the crisis from this day forward. We express our
appreciation to the authors of the resolution-Australia,

Jordan and Luxembourg - for their advocacy of
humanitarian causes.

The Republic of Korea voted in favour of the
resolution, as it lays out important steps to alleviate
the suffering of all civilians in Syria, especially those
who are trapped in besieged areas. The resolution
demands that all parties, in particular the Syrian
authorities, promptly allow rapid, safe and unhindered
humanitarian access for all United Nations agencies
and their partners, including across conflict lines and
across borders. As we welcome the resolution, we are
also aware that it will not end the conflict. We urge both
parties in Syria to engage more seriously in political
negotiations.

In that regard, we reaffirm our unqualified support
for the mediation efforts of Secretary-General Ban
Ki-moon and Special Envoy Brahimi.
