The President: In accordance with rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite the
representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
to participate in this meeting.

In accordance with rule 39 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure, I invite the following
briefers to participate in today's meeting: Mr. Mark
Lowcock, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian
Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator; Ms. Jeanine
Bandu Bahati, Coordinator of the Encadrement des
Femmes Indigenes et des Menages Vulnerables; and
Abbe Donatien Nshole, Secretary-General of the
Conference Episcopale Nationale du Congo.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

Recalling the Security Council's latest note 507 on
its working methods (S/2017/507), I wish to encourage
all participants, members and non-members of the
Council alike, to deliver their statements in five minutes
or less. Note 507 also encourages briefers to be succinct
and to focus on key issues. Briefers are encouraged to
limit initial remarks to 15 minutes or less.

I now give the floor to Mr. Lowcock.
