The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as the representative of the Republic of Korea.

I thank the Under-Secretary-General for Political
Affairs, Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, for his briefing.

The Republic of Korea is deeply concerned about
the continuing tensions in eastern Ukraine. Despite the
agreement reached in Geneva on 17 April, the situation
in Ukraine is showing no signs of abating. We are
particularly alarmed by the fresh violence that erupted
in Sloviansk over night, including violent attacks
targeting two Government helicopters by illegal armed
groups. We strongly condemn those attacks, which
resulted in the death of two Ukrainians. Such instances
point to a serious deterioration in the situation. All
provocative actions and hostile rhetoric aimed at
destabilizing Ukraine must cease immediately.

In the light of the ongoing situation in Ukraine, we
reiterate that constructive dialogue among all concerned
parties will be the only way to achieve a peaceful
solution. In that regard, we call for all parties to the
Geneva statement to implement their commitments.
We also fully support the Secretary-General's good
offices and diplomatic initiatives. We hope that Under-
Secretary-General Feltman's upcoming visit to Ukraine
and Russia will contribute to a de-escalating of tensions
on the ground.

With the important elections scheduled in May, it is
still all the more important to ensure the environment
is conducive to fair and free elections in the country
without any intervention or influence by outside forces.
We hope that the Ukrainian Government will lead a
inclusive and transparent constitutional process.

We once again reaffirm our full support for
Ukraine's sovereignty, independence and territorial
integrity.

I resume now my functions as President of the
Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Ukraine.
