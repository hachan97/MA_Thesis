Sir John Sawers (United Kingdom): I am sorry
to intervene again, but I shall do so very briefly. I have
heard nothing this afternoon that leads me to change
the statement I made earlier, but I just want to respond
to the parallels that, not for the first time, our respected
colleague Ambassador Churkin has sought to draw
between Russian actions in Georgia and the NATO
intervention in Kosovo in 1999. I am afraid that that
assertion of Ambassador Churkin simply does not stand
up to scrutiny.

The military action in Kosovo in 1999 was a
multinational operation; its purpose was to avert an
impending humanitarian crisis, in pursuit of objectives
set out in Security Council resolutions; and it took
place only after all other peaceful avenues had been
exhausted, including a major international conference
on Kosovo's future, whose outcome was blocked by
Serbia, and following further atrocities committed by
Serb forces. There followed nine years of United
Nations administration and further exhaustive
diplomatic efforts, before Kosovo, with extensive
international support, moved to independence after the
final status process called for by resolution 1244
(1999). It was only because of the position of the
Russian Federation that the Council was unable to
endorse the plan drawn up by the United Nations envoy
in accordance with that resolution.

In contrast, Russia has taken just three weeks to
move from military intervention, in defiance of
numerous resolutions of this Council, to a unilateral re-
drawing of Georgia's borders, with no political
process. The actions of Russian forces in Georgia
following 7 August and the hundreds of thousands of
Georgian refugees give the lie to the idea that that was
a humanitarian intervention.
