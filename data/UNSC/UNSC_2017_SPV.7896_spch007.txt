The President: I now give the floor to the members
of the Security Council. I would like to remind all
speakers that as per presidential note S/2010/507, the
presidency encourages all speakers to conclude their
remarks within five minutes. The red microphone
light will flash to indicate when the five minutes is up,
meaning that it is time for a delegation to wrap up its
remarks. We have a full morning of speakers inscribed
on the list and a busy afternoon as well, so if necessary
I will use the gavel to respectfully encourage speakers
to stick to the time limit.
