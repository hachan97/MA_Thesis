The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Liberia, in which she requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Ms. Kamara
(Liberia) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Ms. Ellen Margrethe
Loj, Special Representative of the Secretary-General
and head of the United Nations Mission in Liberia.

It is so decided.

I invite Ms. Loj to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

I wish to draw the attention of members to
document S/2010/429, containing the twenty-first
progress report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Mission in Liberia.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Ms. Loj. I now give the floor to Ms. Loj.
