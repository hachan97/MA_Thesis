The President: I thank the Permanent Observer
of Palestine to the United Nations for his kind words
addressed to me, to Bangladesh and to Mr. Chowdhury.

We had a very substantive and focused discussion
on the prevention of armed conflicts. I thank all
participants for their constructive and extremely
valuable contributions.

From the discussion that we had today, I find that
the principles and recommendations presented by the
Secretary-General have been received positively.

The Fourth High-level Meeting between the
United Nations and the regional organizations in
February marked a major step in strengthening
cooperation on conflict prevention.

The momentum created by the release of the
report and today's discussion should be maintained.

As for the Council's action, it is my
understanding that members of the Council may
continue its discussion of the recommendations within
its competence. The Council will take an early decision
on the recommendations specifically addressed to it.

The prevention of armed conflict is one of our
primary obligations under the Charter. Let us live up to
our solemn pledges to save the peoples of the United
Nations from the scourge of war.

There are no further speakers on the list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on the agenda.

The Council will remain seized of the matter.

The meeting rose at 6.40pm.
