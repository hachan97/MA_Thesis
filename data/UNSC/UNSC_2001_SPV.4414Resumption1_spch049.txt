The President: I thank Mr. Brahimi for his
statement. I also wanted to join him in thanking all
those who have participated in this open debate, which
has provided an opportunity for Members of the United
Nations to benefit from the briefing provided by the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General for
Afghanistan and to express their own views on the
situation in Afghanistan. The views expressed here
today will certainly enrich the Council's future
deliberations. I also wanted to express the appreciation

of the Jamaican delegation for the kind words extended
to us.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting me at 7.05 pm.
