The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

As this is the last scheduled meeting of the Council
for the month of October, I should like to express the
sincere appreciation of the Argentine delegation to the
members of the Council; to all of my colleagues, in
particular the "W-6" - the six women Ambassadors to
the Council; to the Permanent Representatives and their
respective staffs; and to the secretariat ofthe Council for
the warm support it has given us with professionalism
and a great deal of patience.

It has been a very busy month. We have reached
consensus on important matters, while other issues
are still pending. The text prepared by the secretariat
says that we could not have done it alone, and that is
true. The Council's work is not the work of a single
person, or of five, six or seven. It is the work of all,
hard work and an immense responsibility. We value
the support and positive contributions, as well as the
constructive criticism, of every one of the delegations
and the representatives of the Secretariat, as well as all
of the relevant conference service officers.

As we end our presidency, I am sure that the
members of the Security Council will speak in a single
voice in wishing the delegation of Australia very good
luck for the month of November.

The meeting rose at 4.50 pm.
