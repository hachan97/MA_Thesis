Mr. Vitrenko (Ukraine): Once again, the Russian
delegation referred to Crimea as if it were its own, in
outright contravention of General Assembly resolution
68/262, thereby directly insulting at least 100 States
Members of the United Nations that voted in its favour,
as well as resolution 71/205, which was loud and clear in
recognizing Russia as the occupying Power in Crimea.

Today, I listened carefully to the Russian
representative and heard no intention whatsoever to
cooperate with the United Nations Human Rights
Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. Ifthe situation is as rosy
as it is presented by the Russian delegation, why is the
Russian Federation so afraid of allowing the Monitoring
Mission to enter the peninsula? Today's assertions by
the representative of the Russian Federation on the
situation in Ukraine suggests that all States Members
of the United Nations should carefully read all of the
reports by the Human Rights Monitoring Mission in
Ukraine that we mentioned in our statement. Read them
in their entirety and do not resort to cherry-picking and
manipulating them as the Russian Federation continues
to do.

In conclusion, while rejecting each and every
point made by the Russian delegation on Ukraine, I
must still acknowledge that there is hardly any better
illustration than the Russian delegation's intervention
on how dramatically the Russian Federation departed
from the purposes and principles of the Charter of the
United Nations. Perhaps, that is because it is one of the
youngest Members of the United Nations and, unlike

Ukraine, it did not draft the Charter.

The meeting rose at 5.25 pm.
