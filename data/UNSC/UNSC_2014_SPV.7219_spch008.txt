Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): I would
like to thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his
briefing.

China is shocked and grieved by the downing of
Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 in eastern Ukraine.
On behalf of the Chinese Government and people, I
express our sincere condolences and deep sympathy to
the victims and their families.

The safety of international civil aviation must
be guaranteed. Our priority now is to establish the
facts. Pending that, it is not advisable to jump to any
conclusion, make any assumptions or trade accusations.
We support the holding of an independent, fair and
objective investigation into the incident. We also call
on all parties to coordinate and cooperate during the
investigation.

The recent situation in Ukraine remains turbulent.
Armed conflict and incidents of violence frequently
occur, causing loss of life and destruction of property.
China is deeply concerned about the situation. We hope
that the parties concerned will take into account the
well-being of the entire population of Ukraine, focus
on maintaining regional peace and stability, stay calm
and exercise restraint to prevent the further escalation
of the conflict and confrontation.

The crisis in Ukraine is rooted in a complex
situation that is both historical and contemporary. A
political solution is the only way out. China notes the
recent constructive efforts of the parties concerned to
achieve a ceasefire through dialogue and to promote a
political solution. We hope that the parties concerned
will remain committed to dialogue and negotiations,
take the rights and aspirations of all regions and etnic
groups of Ukraine fully into account and bear in mind
the legitimate concerns of all the parties involved
so that the rights of all parties can be respected in
a balanced way. We urge the parties concerned to
effectively implement the agreed ceasefire and to
strengthen dialogue and consultation on the basis of the
Geneva agreement in pursuit of a political solution and
the prompt achievement of stability and development
in Ukraine.

China respects the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of all countries, including Ukraine. China
will continue to adopt a fair and objective approach and
actively participate in any proposal or initiative that
will reduce tension and promote a political solution. We
will play a constructive role in that process.
