Mr. El-Keib (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): I should
like to thank the representatives of the Russian
10

Federation and China for their statements, and to
inform them that the matter at hand, which concerns
the blood of Libyans, should not be fodder for political
propaganda on the part of any country against others.
The Libyan Government has investigated the
circumstances of the deaths of each and every Libyan
civilian, and has enjoyed the cooperation of NATO
with regard to certain excesses that may have taken
place and led to the deaths of some civilians.

I hope that the reason for raising this matter is not
to impede or prevent the international community from
intervening in situations in other States where the
people are being massacred by their own rulers.
