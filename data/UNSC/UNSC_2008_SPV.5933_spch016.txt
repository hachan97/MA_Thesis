Mr. Arias (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): We are
all aware of the deplorable economic situation in which
the people of Zimbabwe find themselves and the
serious and widespread violations of their human rights
being committed, primarily by their Government. That
issue did not give rise to a great deal of discussion
during the debate on the draft resolution that has just
been put before the Council. Among other things,
differences in position focused on whether the Charter
authorized the Council to adopt the draft resolution
before it, given that some members believe that the
situation in Zimbabwe is strictly an internal affair that
does not pose a risk to either international or regional
peace.

Panama believes that, while it is true that when
the Charter initially gave the Security Council
responsibility for maintaining international peace and
security, it was referring mainly to conflicts between
States. In today's globalized and interdependent world,
the concept of threats to international peace has
evolved to include situations in which there are serious
and widespread violations of human rights such as
those being suffered today by the people of Zimbabwe.
In that connection, I shall limit myself to referring to
the report of the Secretary-General, which states that
the seriousness of the situation and its potential
consequences could have widespread repercussions for
regional peace and security.

For those reasons, Panama voted in favour of the
draft resolution.
