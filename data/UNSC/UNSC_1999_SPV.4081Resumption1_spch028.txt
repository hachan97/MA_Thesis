The President: That was a very innovative
suggestion, at an innovative meeting of the Security
Council, for which I am grateful.

I thank the representative of Sierra Leone for his
kind words addressed to me.

The next speaker is the representative of Uganda. I
invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make
his statement.
