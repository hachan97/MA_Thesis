Mr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): It is quite telling
that the Russian delegation decided to comment on
our statement. This kind of reaction suggests that it
believes that the dock in The Hague will remain empty.
But we would like to recall that the crimes committed
by the Russian Federation in Ukraine have no statute of
limitations. I do not want to repeat once again our well-
known position on crimes committed by the aggressor
State, which are under consideration in international
courts. The only honest and responsible way out of
the situation created by the Russian aggression is by
ending the aggression, offering appropriate assurances
and guarantees of its non-repetition and ensuring
full reparation, compensation and satisfaction for the
damage caused.
