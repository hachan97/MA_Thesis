Mr. Bermudez (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish):
Allow me to begin by expressing Uruguay's renewed
delight regarding the extraordinary progress of the
peace process in Colombia. We are strongly welcome
the temporary national bilateral ceasefire that was
announced on 4 September by the Government of
Colombia and the Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional
(ELN), and its entry into force from 1 October 2017 to
9 January 2018.

We received and took very seriously the joint
request of both parties in their Joint Communique of
29 September for the United Nations to participate
as international coordinator in a monitoring and
verification mechanism made up of representatives of
the Government of Colombia, the Ej ercito de Liberacion
Nacional and the Catholic Church aimed at ensuring
compliance with the temporary bilateral ceasefire.

In that regard, Uruguay welcomes the unanimous
adoption of resolution 2381 (2017), endorsing the
recommendations made by the Secretary-General in his
letter dated 2 October (S/2017/830) and which will allow
the United Nations Verfication Mission in Colombia to
carry out the tasks requested by the parties.

To conclude, we would like to express the firm
commitment of the United Nations, including the
Security Council, to ensuring lasting peace in our
brotherly country Colombia.
