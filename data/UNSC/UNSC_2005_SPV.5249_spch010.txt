Mr. Bolton (United States of America): I would
like to thank the representative of Greece for allowing
me to do earlier something that I had planned to do
later. It is something that, while not entirely
revolutionary, may be precedential. With your
indulgence, Mr. President, rather than read out my
remarks, I am simply going to ask that they be
circulated for the careful consideration of everyone on
the Council.
