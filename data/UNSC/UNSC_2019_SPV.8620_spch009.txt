Mr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish):
First, we would like to join others in condemning the
regrettable attacks in Kabul and Parwan province
and in extending to the people and the Government
of Afghanistan our sincerest condolences for the loss
of life.

Peru joined in the unanimous adoption of resolution
2489 (2019) because we believe that, in the current
political and security context, it is vital to expand the
scope of the mandate of the United Nations Assistance
Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) to account for new
developments. As the presidential elections draw near,
we believe that the resolution will contribute to the
objectives of stability, reconciliation, sustainable peace
and the fight against corruption in Afghanistan.

In thanking Germany and Indonesia for their
efforts to achieve consensus among all the members
of the Council during the discussions on UNAMA's
mandate renewal, we highlight the flexibility shown
by all participants in the negotiations and stress the
importance of continuing to work to provide adequate
monitoring and decisive support for UNAMA's work in
its various functions.

I wish to conclude by welcoming the fact that,
importantly, the Council is united in its commitment to
Afghanistan and to the peace process undertaken and
led by Afghans themselves.
