Mr. Miyet: I did not realize that the representative
of Bahrain had asked me that question - I thought it was
an observation. All efforts leading to the alleviation of the
suffering of the people and to improving their plight are
welcome. I think that it would be useful to discuss the
matter with Carolyn McAskie, the acting Emergency
Relief Coordinator, so that she can check with the
International Committee of the Red Cross, the United
Nations Children's Fund and the World Health
Organization and find out which agencies are working
most actively in that area and are able to support such a
process. I will inform her about those project initiatives
on the part of Bahrain.
