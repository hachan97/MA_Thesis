Mr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): I offer
sincere congratulations to the German Ambassador and
his team for their untiring and generous efforts,
sensitivity, perseverance and their great elegance in
leading this ship to a good port. I would like to
reiterate the gratitude and appreciation of my
delegation to the German Ambassador and his team.

After a few tense and somber days, today is an
important day for the Council, due to the fact that it
was able to unite to tackle a serious humanitarian issue.

As the Secretary-General aptly observed a few
days ago, the peoples of the world might feel a sense of
frustration when they witnessed what was happening in
the United Nations Security Council. What happened
today can serve to redress the situation, improve our
image and restore the unity that must prevail in this
important body.
