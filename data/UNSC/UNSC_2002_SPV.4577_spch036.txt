Mr. Koroma (Sierra Leone): I would like to say
here that important lessons come from the engagement
in Sierra Leone of the United Nations Mission
(UNAMSIL), and that those lessons can be applied in
the subregional context. It is important to note that the
job of UNAMSIL, as a lesson, is not yet complete in
Sierra Leone. There are a few things that need to be
further addressed. They have been addressed very well,
but they need to be addressed adequately to ensure that
we do not slide back internally. They include issues of
reintegration of ex-combatants, issues of getting a more
comprehensive mandate for UNAMSIL to cover
recovery and issues of governance which must equally
be addressed to ensure that the country does not slide
back.

I want to add that the lessons learned by
UNAMSIL in Sierra Leone can help us not only to
extend the UNAMSIL mandate, but to expand it to
include the subregional context. I believe we should
find a way of integrating what the Mano River Union is
doing, what ECOWAS is doing, and what UNAMSIL
can also do to improve the situation. It is important that
we do this because UNAMSIL is already mobilized in
the subregion; it is already there. There will be a lot of
cost-saving if UNAMSIL, as it is in Sierra Leone, can
review its mandate to include the subregional situation.
