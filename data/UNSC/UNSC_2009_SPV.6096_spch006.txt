Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): My
delegation would like to thank Mr. Rashid Khalikov of
the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(OCHA) for the information he has provided this
afternoon, which itself is justification for the holding
of this meeting.

The decision by the Government of the Sudan to
halt the operations of the 13 non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) concerned, which provide
humanitarian assistance in northern Sudan, including in
Darfur, is, to say the least, unfortunate. That decision
not only inappropriately links the humanitarian
situation with a decision by an international tribunal; it
also jeopardizes the lives of a considerable number of
people and opens the door to a crisis of major
proportions by creating obstacles to access for
international assistance. That jeopardizes the lives of
large parts of the population, in particular those of
vulnerable groups such as women and children.

Mexico is also concerned about the safety and
security of humanitarian personnel on the ground,
given the repeated incidents of intimidation and threats
reported by OCHA. Mexico unreservedly condemns
those incidents.

In order to address the situation in the Sudan as
comprehensively as possible, my delegation urgently
calls upon the Government of the Sudan to reverse its
decision, allow the return of the non-governmental
organizations that have been expelled and facilitate and
guarantee adequate access for humanitarian aid and
assistance to the civilian population, in line with the
norms of international humanitarian law.
