The President (spoke in French): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of Belgium.

Belgium voices its grave concern at the tension
now reigning in South Ossetia, Georgia, which has
already claimed numerous lives and caused a great
number of injuries. In View of this very serious
deterioration of the situation in the region, including in
the humanitarian area, Belgium urges all parties
concerned to halt military operations and display
moderation. We appeal to the parties to agree to an
immediate, unconditional ceasefire and to work, with
the assistance of the international community, to
speedily resume their dialogue.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Finland.
