Mr. Araud (France) (spoke in French): France
welcomes the agreement reached on 20 June by the
Sudanese authorities under the auspices of the Prime
Minister of Ethiopia, Mr. Meles Zenawi, and the High-
2

level Panel chaired by President Mbeki. This
agreement should allow for the withdrawal of the
troops of the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Sudanese
People's Liberation Army, the return of civilians and
the opening of the path to determining the status of
Abyei. France would like to thank Ethiopia for making
a seasoned contingent available.

The mandate for force provided for in the
resolution that we have just adopted corresponds to
France's main expectations for the United Nations
mission in Abyei. In particular, we welcome the fact
that the mandate is robust and that the resolution calls
upon the parties to facilitate the return of displaced
persons and requires follow-up to human rights issues.

While recognizing the urgency posed by the
tragic conditions on the ground and the imminent
independence of Southern Sudan, France would like to
recall, given the numerous peacekeeping missions that
will succeed the United Nations Mission in the Sudan,
the need for coherent comprehensive action by the
United Nations in the Sudan. On this occasion, France
would like to recognize the need to have an overall
vision, both for coordinating the missions and for
determining the total strength of the peacekeeping
operations. In this context, the size of the United
Nations mission that will be deployed in Southern
Sudan should be consistent with the progressive
takeover by the South of the competencies ofa State.
