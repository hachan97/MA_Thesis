Mr. Kovanda (Czech Republic): The Czech Republic
wishes to reaffirm its attachment to a just, durable and
comprehensive settlement of the Palestinian question and of
the entire Arab-Israeli conflict, on the basis of resolutions
242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and within the agreed
framework of international law. This includes the necessity
of applying the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949.

In recent years, efforts towards attaining a settlement
of the conflict have resulted in the ongoing peace process.
The Czech Republic accepts and supports it without
reservation. We are heartened by the progress it has
attained since the Washington Declaration of Principles was
signed more than two years ago.

 

Important steps followed last year: the Gaza-Jericho
Agreement of last May, the Agreement on Preparatory
Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities of last August
and, of course, the Peace Treaty between Israel and
Jordan of last October.

The issue of Israeli settlements in occupied
territories is a difficult and emotionally charged one. The
Czech Government considers settlements to be illegal and
not conducive to the peace process. And yet the Israeli
Government has effected important changes in this policy,
and, whatever reservations one might have about the
current shape of this policy, these changes should be
noted. Even more importantly, though, this issue is just
one aspect of the exceedingly complex web of Israeli-
Palestinian relations, and we believe that this entire web
would be best left to the continuation of bilateral
negotiations, however difficult these are turning out to be,
outside the spotlight of international attention.

We feel that some of the difficulties in the progress
of bilateral negotiations stem from recent acts of brutal
Violence. A year ago, in March, the Council strongly
condemned the slaughter in Hebron. Today it is worth
reiterating that the Czech Republic condemns all
terrorism, whatever its motivation, under any
circumstances.
