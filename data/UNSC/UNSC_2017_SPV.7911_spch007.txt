Mr. Inchauste Jordan (Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish):
The Plurinational State of Bolivia thanks the delegation
of the United Kingdom for having taken the initiative of
introducing resolution 2349 (2017), which was adopted
unanimously, thereby showing the Security Council's
commitment to combating terrorism. In that regard, we
would like to highlight the goal of the resolution, which
is to show support for the Governments of Cameroon,
Chad, the Niger and Nigeria in their struggle against
Boko Haram. We appreciate the efforts that have been
made by those countries in developing action plans to
combat terrorism, which is a fight that they are waging
on behalf of all of us. Accordingly, we call on the
Council to maintain a unified front with regard to that
issue, while respecting the independence, sovereignty
and territorial integrity of those countries.

However, we support and share the concerns
expressed by other delegations with regard to the
working methods concerned. We believe that, in
this instance, the time allotted to negotiations was
insufficient, which meant that some of the delegations'
observations were not reflected as optimally as they
could have been in the resolution. We believe that, had
it been possible, we could have planned for additional
negotiations starting where we left off, or postponed
putting the draft resolution to the vote.
