The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now make
another statement in my national capacity.

Peru abstained in the voting because we believe that
the draft resolution did not adequately reflect the need
to guarantee due accountability for the use of chemical
weapons throughout Syrian terrority and because its
language is imbalanced and would not help to restore
the Council's unity, which is critical to addressing the
events in Syria in a comprehensive manner.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

The representative of the United Kingdom has
asked to make another statement.
