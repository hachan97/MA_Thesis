The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them document
8/2012/555, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members to
document S/2012/507, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the United Nations operation in
Cyprus.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.

I should like to inform the Councilthat the presidency
of the Council has met with the representatives of the
parties, who have confirmed that they maintain their
well-known positions vis-a-vis the item on the Council's
agenda. On the basis of those meetings, with the
consent of the members of the Council, the presidency
has drawn the conclusion that the Council can proceed
to take a decision on the draft resolution before it. IfI
hear no objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the
vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by Show ofhands.

In favour:
Colombia, China, France, Germany, Guatemala,
India, Morocco, Portugal, Russian Federation, South
Africa, Togo, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, United States of America

Abstentions:

The President (spoke in Spanish): There were 13
votes in favour, none against and two abstentions. The
draft resolution has been adopted as resolution 2058
(2012).

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements after the voting.
