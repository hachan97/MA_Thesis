The President (spoke in French): I would like to
thank the Director of the Programme for Coordination
and Assistance for Security and Development
(PCASED) for his contribution.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2003/328, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

Infavour:
Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Guinea, Mexico, Pakistan,
Russian Federation, Spain, Syrian Arab Republic,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, United States of America.
The President (spoke in French): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1467 (2003).

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. I now invite Council members to informal
consultations on Iraq, immediately following the
adjournment of this meeting.

The meeting rose at 6.20 p.m.
