The President (spoke in Chinese): I thank the
Secretary-General for his statement.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to remind speakers to
limit their statements to no more than seven minutes in
order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing in the
Chamber and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking.

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Amr
Moussa, Secretary-General of the League of Arab
States.
