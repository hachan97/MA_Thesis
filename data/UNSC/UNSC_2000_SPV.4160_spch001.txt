Mr. Sergeev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Before we take a decision on the important
item that has been before the Security Council for some
time now, we should like to ensure that there is
complete understanding among Council members on all
aspects of the issue, especially given the fact that, as
far as we know, there is additional information directly
related to this item. In this connection, the Russian
delegation would request that the meeting be
suspended so that the Council might return to
consultations. The meeting could be resumed later and,
I hope, a decision taken.
