Sir John Weston (United Kingdom): I have the
honour to make the following statement on behalf of the
European Union. The Central and Eastern European
countries associated with the European Union - Estonia,
Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia - and
the associated country Cyprus, as well as the European Free
Trade Association country member of the European
Economic Area, Iceland, align themselves with this
statement.

The European Union warmly welcomes the adoption
of this resolution, which reflects the abhorrence of the
international community as a whole at the recent nuclear
tests carried out first by India and then by Pakistan, and its
deep concern about the threat posed to the peace and
stability of the South Asia region by nuclear and missile
proliferation. As the European Union has already made
clear, we condemn these actions, which run counter to the
will expressed by the 149 signatories of the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty to cease nuclear testing, and to

efforts to strengthen the global non-proliferation regime.

The European Union remains fully committed to the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as
the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime and
the essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear
disarmament, and calls on all States which have not yet
done so to become parties to it. The European Union also
remains fully committed to the early entry into force of
the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.

The European Union urges India and Pakistan to
take early steps to demonstrate their commitment to
international efforts on non-proliferation and nuclear
disarmament by signing the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-
Ban Treaty and moving to ratify it; by contributing
actively and without conditions towards the opening of
negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva
for a treaty banning the production of fissile material for
nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices; by
exerting stringent controls over the export of material,
equipment and technology controlled under the Nuclear
Suppliers' Group trigger and dual use lists and the Missile
Technology Control Regime annex; and by committing
themselves neither to assemble nuclear devices nor to
deploy such devices on delivery vehicles, and to cease
development and deployment of ballistic missiles capable
of delivering nuclear warheads.

The European Union will follow closely the
evolution of the situation and take appropriate action
should India and Pakistan not sign and move to ratify the
relevant international non-proliferation agreements, in
particular the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty,
without conditions.

The European Union also urges India and Pakistan
to engage in a dialogue which addresses the root causes
of the tension between them, and to try to build
confidence rather than seek confrontation.
