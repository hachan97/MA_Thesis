Ms. Power (United States of America): I thank
Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing.

On 17 April, Ukraine, the Russian Federation,
the European Union and the United States issued the
Geneva joint statement to de-escalate the crisis that
brings us together this evening. That statement outlined
a series of concrete steps to end the violence, halt
provocative actions and protect the rights and security
of all Ukrainian citizens. As Secretary Kerry said on
17 April,
"All of this, we are convinced, represents a
good day's work. The day's work has produced
principles and it has produced commitments and
it has produced words on paper. And we are the
first to understand and to agree that words on paper
will only mean what the actions that are taken as a
result of those words produce."

Secretary Kerry also commended Foreign Minister
Lavrov and the Ukrainian Foreign Minister for
their cooperation in achieving that hard-negotiated
agreement. It was a moment of hope. Since then, the
Government of Ukraine has been implementing its
commitments in good faith. Regrettably, the same
cannot be said of the Russian Federation.

As we meet, observers from the special monitoring
mission of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) are reporting that most
of Ukraine, including eastern Ukraine, is peaceful. The
exceptions are in such areas as Donetsk, Luhansk and
Sloviansk, where pro-Russian separatists continue to
occupy buildings and attack local officials. There we
have seen a sharp deterioration in law and order.

Just today, pro-Russian separatists armed with
baseball bats, stormed the Government buildings in
Luhansk, seizing control of the centre of municipal
activity in one of the largest cities in eastern Ukraine.
That kind of thuggery mimics the seizures of police
stations, city halls and other Government buildings
in cities and towns in Donetsk oblast and surrounding
areas.

In addition to occupying Government buildings,
over the past two weeks, gunmen kidnapped a senior
police officer in Luhansk. In Donetsk, pro-Russian
thugs armed with baseball bats attacked peaceful
participants at a pro-unity rally, seriously injuring at
least 15. Also in Donetsk, pro-Russian groups continue
to hold 17 buildings, including the regional television
broadcasting centre.

In the city of Sloviansk, the mayor was kidnapped,
as were several journalists. The separatists in that
area now hold an estimated 40 hostages. Nearby, three
bodies were recently pulled from a river, each showing
unmistakable signs of physical abuse; one has been
identified as a local politician, another as a 19 year-
old pro-unity student activist. Yesterday, gunmen
reportedly chased members of the Sloviansk Roma
community from their homes. Make no mistake: those
are not peaceful protests. It is not an eastern Ukrainian
spring. It is a well-orchestrated campaign, with external
support, to destabilize the Ukrainian State.

Finally, as all the world knows, pro-Russian
separatists in Donetsk have kidnapped and continue
to hold seven international inspectors, openly declared
as members of a Vienna document mission, along with
their Ukrainian escorts. My Government joins with
responsible Governments everywhere in condemning
that unlawful act and in being outraged by the shameful
exhibition before the media of those international
public servants.

The Vienna document, agreed upon by all
57 participating States of the OSCE, has been a lasting
source of cooperation and military transparency. We
call, with others, for the immediate and unconditional
release of the inspectors and their Ukrainian escorts
and the immediate end to their mistreatment while in
captivity. We also call upon Russia, as a signatory to
the Vienna document, to help secure their release and
to confirm publicly, even if belatedly, for the record that
the abducted monitors were part of a legitimate mission
on behalf of the international community.

Since 17 April, the Government of Ukraine has
acted in good faith and with admirable restraint to
fulfil its commitments. The Kyiv city hall and its
surrounding area are now clear of all Maidan barricades
and protestors. Over the Easter holiday, Ukraine
voluntarily suspended its counter-terrorism initiative,
choosing to de-escalate despite its fundamental right
to provide security on its own territory and for its own
people. Unlike the separatists, Ukraine has cooperated
fully with the OSCE special monitoring mission and
allowed its observers to operate in regions about which
Moscow had voiced concerns regarding the treatment
of ethnic Russians.

In addition, Prime Minister Yatsenyuk has publicly
committed his Government to undertake far-reaching
constitutional reforms that will strengthen the power
of the regions. He has appealed personally to Russian-
speaking Ukrainians, pledging to support special status
for the Russian language and to protect those who use
it. He announced legislation to grant amnesty to those
who surrender arms.

All of that should be cause for optimism and
hope. Tragically, what we have seen from Russia since
17 April is exactly what we saw from Russia prior to
17 April: more attempts to stir up trouble, more efforts
to undermine the Government of Ukraine and statement
after statement at odds with the facts. What we have
not seen is a single positive step by Russia to fulfil its
Geneva commitments.

Instead, Russian officials have refused to publicly
call on the separatists to give up their weapons and
relinquish their illegal control of Ukrainian Government
buildings. In fact, Russia continues to fund, to coordinate
and to fuel the heavily armed separatist movement. In
addition, just outside of Ukraine's border, Russia has
continued to engage in threatening troop movements
that are designed not to calm tensions, but to embolden
the separatists and to intimidate the Government.

In conclusion, I emphasize that the United States
remains committed to supporting the principles of
the Charter of the United Nations and will continue
to uphold the territorial integrity and sovereignty of
Ukraine. We continue to seek stability within a peaceful,
democratic, inclusive and united Ukraine, especially in
advance of the upcoming important elections.

We remain committed to a diplomatic process,
but Russia seems committed to destabilization and
fantastical justifications for its actions. The truth
about what is happening in Ukraine should guide our
discussion, because truth is the only foundation on
which an equitable and lasting solution to this crisis
can be based.
