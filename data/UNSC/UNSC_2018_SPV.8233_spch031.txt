Mr. Alotaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): Kuwait
voted against draft resolution S/2018/355. At the time
when the State of Kuwait reiterates its adherence
to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the
United Nations, which prohibits the threat or use of
force as a means to settle disputes and requires them
to be settled by peaceful means, yesterday's use of
force was the result of efforts to disrupt the will of the
international community, specifically by hindering the
Security Council in its determination to take measures
at its disposal to end the ongoing use of internationally
prohibited chemical weapons in Syria. That is a flagrant
violation ofresolution 2118 (2013), which unequivocally
expresses the Security Council's intention to act under
Chapter VII of the Charter when one party or several
parties fail to comply with its provisions or in the case
of the continued use of chemical weapons in Syria.

The Council must once again show its unity and
bear its responsibility for maintaining international
peace and security, in accordance with the Charter.
It must agree on a new independent, impartial and
professional mechanism for investigating any use of
chemical weapons, bring those responsible for such
crimes to account, and ensure that they do not enjoy
impunity. We call for intensified efforts and a return
to the political track, under the auspices of the United
Nations, with the aim of reaching a peaceful settlement
to the crisis based on the first Geneva communique
(S/2012/522, annex) and resolution 2254 (2015).
