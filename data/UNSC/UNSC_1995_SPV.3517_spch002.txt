Mr. Fulci (Italy): Italy will vote in favour of the
draft resolution on Liberia, since it constitutes a merely
technical renewal of the United Nations Observer Mission
there. During the present delay in the peace process,
legitimate doubts are being raised about the wisdom of
maintaining this mission unless the parties demonstrate
real goodwill and a real intention to accelerate the
reconciliation process.

We agree with the substance of the draft resolution,
in particular with regard to the need to hold the summit
of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) as soon as possible. We are also in favour of
the measures concerning the establishment of a sanctions
committee to be entrusted with verifying the application
of the arms embargo against Liberia.

We understand that the continued, and continuing,
violation of the weapons embargo is one of the major
obstacles hindering the efforts of the international
community towards the re-establishment of peace in
Liberia. Hopefully, this measure will also signal to the
countries in the area that the Security Council is serious
about the question and, more generally, that they need to
really commit themselves to creating the proper
conditions for implementing the Akosombo and Accra
Agreements.
