The President: I should now like to make a
statement in my capacity as representative of Japan.

Japan welcomes the adoption of resolution 1618
(2005) with unanimous support. That demonstrates the
Council's strong determination to condemn terrorism
and to do its utmost to prevent further acts of terrorism
in Iraq as well as in other countries and places. In
particular, Japan hopes that despite the tragic deaths of
Mijbil Sheikh Issa and Thamen Hossein Obeidi, the
constitutional process in Iraq will continue to recover
its pace so that the political process, as outlined in
resolution 1546 (2004), can move forward in order to
achieve the goal of realizing a stable and peaceful Iraq
as early as possible.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

I now give the floor to the representative of Iraq.
