Mr. Urbina (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): My
delegation supports the extension of the mandate of the
United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and
voted in favour of the resolution. Nevertheless, we wish
to state our regret over the weakening of the language
through the failure in the operative part explicitly to
address our concern over the increase in civilian
casualties, as the Security Council has done in previous
resolutions. We know, of course, that insurgents are
primarily responsible for civilian casualties in
Afghanistan, but this Council has repeatedly called on
all parties to respect the provisions of international
humanitarian law and human rights, and to take every
possible precaution to ensure the protection of the
civilian population in that country. My delegation
understands that this concern is alluded to in paragraph
14 of resolution 1868 (2009), just adopted.
