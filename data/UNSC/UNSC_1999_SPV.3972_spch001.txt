The President (interpretation from Spanish): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Georgia and Germany in which they
request to be invited to participate in the discussion of the
item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the discussion,
without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Menagarishvili
(Georgia) took a seat at the Council table; Mr.
Kastrnp (Germany) took the seat reserved for him at
the side of the Council Chamber.

The President (interpretation from Spanish): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General concerning the situation in
Abkhazia, Georgia, document S/ 1999/60.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/l999/79, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by France, Germany, the Russian
Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and the United States of America.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to document S/ 1999/71, which contains the text
of a letter dated 25 January 1999 from the Permanent
Representative of Georgia to the United Nations addressed
to the President of the Security Council.

I welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs of
Georgia, His Excellency Mr. Irakli Menagarishvili, and
invite him to make his statement.
