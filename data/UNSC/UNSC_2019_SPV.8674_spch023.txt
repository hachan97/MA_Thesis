Mr. Heusgen (Germany): I wish very briefly to
say, first, that I believe that international humanitarian
law and humanitarian assistance are very political and
belong in a discussion about the political situation,
because these cannot be separated. Secondly, I leave
it up to others around the table and to the public as to
who is prolonging the suffering of the people - is it
Germany, or is it Russia?
