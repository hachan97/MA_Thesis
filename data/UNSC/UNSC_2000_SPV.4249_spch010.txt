Mr. Chen Xu (China) (spoke in Chinese): At the
outset we would like to thank the Secretary-General for
his report as well the briefing by the Assistant
Secretary-General, Mr. Annabi. We welcome the
presence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Goran
Svilanovic, and welcome his statement.

After local elections in Kosovo, the situation
remains grave. In particular, politically motivated acts
of violence increased. We are deeply concerned by this.
It is our view that if extremist elements and
secessionist forces are not curbed the consequences
will be very serious. We hope that UNMIK and KFOR
will take very forceful measures, and we urge people in
all walks of life in Kosovo, especially their leaders, to
renounce the use of force and translate it into concrete
action.

Recently, in southern Serbia, conflicts occurred in
the ground safety zone bordering Kosovo, and they are
escalating. This not only raises very serious
humanitarian issues, but it will also present new threats
to ethnic relations in Kosovo, thus affecting peace and
stability in that region. This is something we are very
worried about. We strongly condemn the provocative
acts of extremism. We have taken note that KFOR has
adopted some measures and we hope that it will take
further measures to restrict the activities of the
Liberation Army of Presevo, Medveda and Bujanovac
(UCPMB) to ensure that the safety zone is not used as
a haven for attacks against Serbia.

The appropriate resolution of the question of
Kosovo hinges on the understanding, support and
cooperation given to Kosovo. We welcome the efforts
of UNMIK and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to
engage in constructive dialogue on matters of common
concern. Thus, Security Council resolution 1244
(1999) will be fully implemented.
