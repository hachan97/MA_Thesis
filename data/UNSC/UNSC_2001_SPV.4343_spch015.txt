Mr. Eldon (United Kingdom): I am speaking in
an interactive mode, if you like, so I will be very brief.
But firstly, congratulations to you, Sir, and to your
team for the way in which you have handled the
presidency this month.

I would like to make two and a half quick points.
Firstly, I want to take up the point made by David
Cooney and Jean-David Levitte about the preparation
of Security Council missions. I think this is indeed
very important. The way in which each mission is
prepared will depend to a certain degree on what it is
doing and where it is going. But I would simply say
that from my own experience on the second East Timor
mission, we found it very valuable indeed to have a
number of meetings before we left, not only with
Council members, but also with troop-contributors
and - this will be related to my second point - with
other interested parties who feel they have views to
convey about the particular situation, be they United
Nations agencies or perhaps even non-governmental
organizations, as the situation demands.

So, I thoroughly agree with the importance of the
point. I simply hope we won't limit ourselves to the
Pocantico Hills style meetings, which were very useful,
but I think we need to be flexible and imaginative
about how we take this forward.

Secondly, on the working group on peacekeeping:
I think this has been a very valuable innovation, and I
would like to add to the avalanche of congratulations to
Curtis Ward. We are looking forward to the review of
the arrangements for relations with troop contributors
in six months time. As we said before the resolution
was adopted, we will have some ideas of our own to
suggest. In the meantime, in our view, there is plenty of
other work for the working group to be doing, and I
look forward to seeing a significant expansion of its
agenda over the coming months. There are some big
issues out there and we must stress them.
