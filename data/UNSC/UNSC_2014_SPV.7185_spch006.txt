Prince Zeid Ra'ad Zeid Al-Hussein (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): We thank Under-Secretary-General
Jeffrey F eltman for the briefing he has just provided to
the Council.

Jordan welcomes the successful holding of
presidential elections in Ukraine, despite the
exceptional circumstances in the country caused by the
illegal actions of lawless individuals and rebels seeking
to prevent a successful voting process. It is our hope
that the elections will signal a return to stability in
Ukraine and lead it down the road to democracy. We
commend the efforts of the Ukraine Government to
ensure successful elections by eliminating obstacles in
order to allow all Ukrainians to vote for their future.
Now that Ukrainians have been able to vote fully
and freely, the international community must respect
their choice. We urge the international community to
recognize the results of the election and to work with
President-elect Petro Poroshenko so as to enable him to
meet his people's aspirations to a better future.

We express our concern about continuing acts of
violence and criminality in eastern Ukraine, especially
in the Donestk region, where there have been a number
of casualties. Jordan reaffirms Ukraine's legitimate
rights, guaranteed under international law, to protect its
territorial integrity, sovereignty and the security of its
citizenry. The exercise by the authorities of their right
to calm tensions and restore stability must be in line
with international law and international humanitarian
law. We reaffirm our call on all influential parties to
persuade the rebels to lay down their weapons and to
withdraw from the buildings and facilities they are
occupying.
