Mr. Hickey (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom welcomes the adoption of resolution 2410
(2018) today and the renewal of the mandate of the
United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti
(MINUJUSTH) for a further 12 months. As the United
States has made clear, today's vote is not a reflection
of MINUJUSTH or the Government of Haiti. As we
set out on Tuesday (see S/PV.8220), we are committed
to the development of Haiti and an integrated United
Nations country presence. Progress against the exit
strategy over the final 18 months of the Mission will
enable a smooth transfer of tasks from MINUJUSTH to
the United Nations country team and the Government
of Haiti.

We believe strongly that MINUJUSTH must have
the tools it needs to make that transition a success,
and that includes continued authorization under
Chapter VII to use all necessary means to carry out
its mandate. In addition, progress must be measured
against the Secretary-General's benchmarks and
anchored in Haiti's long-term development, security
and political priorities.

MINUJUSTH cannot deliver that alone. Haitian
ownership and delivery of important reforms are
critical to a positive future for the people of Haiti.
We therefore repeat our call on the Government of
Haiti, MINUJUSTH and the United Nations country
team to work closely together to ensure that the solid
foundations exist for long-term political stability.
