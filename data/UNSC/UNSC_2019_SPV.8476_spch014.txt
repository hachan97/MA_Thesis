Mr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish):
Peru did not support the proposed draft resolution
(S/20l9/l90) for the following reasons. It does not
take into account the fundamental aspect of the
problem in Venezuela, which is the existence of an
illegitimate regime that has caused one of the most
serious humanitarian crises and exoduses in the history
of the region 4 a result of its disastrous economic
management and corruption - and neither does it take
into account the flagrant violations of human rights
and individual freedoms or the urgency of holding free
presidential elections.

Peru ratifies its full commitment to the Charter
of the United Nations and its purposes and principles.
However, we cannot accept an approach that considers
only some of the Charter's provisions that we consider
relevant to this case. We also cannot support the quest for
irrelevant dialogue mechanisms, which have repeatedly
failed by virtue of the illegitimate regime's proven lack
of commitment, having been used only to gain time,
perpetuate its time in office and subsequently lash out
with new abuses and violations of human rights.

Peru questions the willingness of a regime
that - as we saw last weekend and heard in the Council
two days ago (see S/PV.8472) - not only opposes the
much-needed access to humanitarian assistance but
also denies the existence of an emergency and crisis,
ignoring the situation and showing no concern for the
3.4 million citizens who have had to flee the tragedy
caused by Nicolas Maduro.
