The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of the Netherlands in which he requests
to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item
on the Council's agenda. In accordance with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure. There
being no objection, so decided.

I invite the representative of the Netherlands to
take the seat reserved for him at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of New Zealand. I invite him to take a
seat at the Council table and make his statement.
