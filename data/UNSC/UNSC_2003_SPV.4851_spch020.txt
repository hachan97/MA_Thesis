The President: I thank Mr. Sevan, and before
closing the meeting, I would recall that we will, of
course, since this has been a regular meeting of the
Council, have a complete record of this meeting very
shortly, which I think will be useful to all Members,
including my own delegation, in terms of being able to
review the comments and questions that were raised.

We have a number of regularly scheduled meetings
of the 661 Committee scheduled between now and 21
November, which I think is a positive development, and,
as Ambassador Thompson mentioned, it is our intention
in the near future, to talk a bit about the follow-on
arrangements intended on the part of the Coalition
Provisional Authority with respect to the oil-for-food
programme.

Lastly, I would remind members that under
resolution 1483 (2003), the Coalition also owes the
Council a report before 22 November on the conduct of
its operations in Iraq in general, so there are going to
be a number of opportunities to review this situation
with respect to the oil-for-food programme as well as
other aspects of the Iraq situation.

If there are no other comments by members of the
Council, I should like once again to thank Under-
Secretary-General Sevan and his team for being here
with us this afternoon.

The meeting rose at 5.30 pm.
