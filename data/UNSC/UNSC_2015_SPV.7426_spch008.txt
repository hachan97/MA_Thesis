Mr. Barros Melet (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): It is
clear that different interpretations exist of the situation
affecting Yemen, but we all agree that the violence is
having a serious effect on the civilian population. For
that reason, we appreciate the fact that the final version
of the resolution we have adopted today (resolution 2216 (2015)) includes stronger language on the humanitarian
situation than was originally proposed, as well as
incorporating the concept of humanitarian pauses,
which has been requested by various humanitarian
agencies and organizations. However, the humanitarian
situation will not improve if the violence does not stop
and if no progress is made with the political dialogue,
which is why we call for speedy implementation of
the ceasefire envisaged in today's resolution. The
continued use of force will eliminate any possibility of
an inclusive and sustainable political dialogue.

We regret the fact that the resolution's text does
not include references to the impact of the growing
violence on young people, including the killing and
maiming of children and their ongoing recruitment
and use in the fighting, as well the obstacles posed to
access to schooling and hospitals, in contravention of
the principles laid out in resolution 2143 (2014). That is
an aspect of the crisis that we cannot overlook.

Lastly, my country feels that it is important, as
has been mentioned, that the negotiation process be
transparent from the very beginning, and that applies
to all members of the Council.
