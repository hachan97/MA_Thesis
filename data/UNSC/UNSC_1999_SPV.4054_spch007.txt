The President (spoke in Russian): I thank the
representative of Nigeria for the kind words he addressed
to me.

It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to vote on the draft resolution in document
S/ 1999/ 1069. If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council who
wish to make statements before the voting.
