Mr. J a'afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): I did not want to respond to my colleague,
because I am in constant contact with him and I always
try to explain to him what is going on in my country
regarding the humanitarian crisis we are facing.
However, Idid not expect him make the mistake ofcalling
me the representative of a regime, especially as he is an
experienced diplomat and a member of the Council. He
is supposed to respect international legitimacy and he
should address me as the representative of my country,
the Syrian Arab Republic. That is the first mistake.

The second mistake is that it seems that the
Permanent Representative of New Zealand and other
colleagues do not read what we send to them. We have
addressed a compendium of 500 letters to the Council
on behalf of the Government of Syria concerning
international terrorism sponsored by countries known
to all. We have been sending such letters since the
beginning ofthe crisis. It would seem that my colleague,
the Permanent Representative of New Zealand, has
not read them. We have sent 60 letters, addressed to
the Permanent Representative of New Zealand among
others, on the use of chemical weapons by terrorists
in Syria. It appears that some Council members do not
read what we send them. I would therefore urge my
colleagues to read these letters, which would definitely
help them to see the situation clearly.

We in Syria have fallen victim to the
misunderstandings of some and the misleading lies
of others. We, as diplomats, have the responsibility to
correct such misunderstandings. We should not lie to
one another.

The meeting rose at 4.50 pm.
