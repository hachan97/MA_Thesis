The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Following consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council recalls the statement
of its President of 16 October 2003
(S/PRST/2003/l7), which confirmed the
continuation of the current arrangements of the
Bureau of the Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1373 (2001) concerning counter-
terrorism for another six months, i.e. until 4 April
2004.

"The said six months having elapsed, the
Security Council confirms the continuation of the
current arrangements for the Bureau of the
Committee for another six months, until 4
October 2004."

This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2004/8.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.
