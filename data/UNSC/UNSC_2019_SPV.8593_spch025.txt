Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I will be brief. I
just want to say for the record that the Security Council
can discuss any issue it wants relating to international
peace and security. The representative of Syria might
like to know that nine countries called for this meeting
and not a single country objected, so it absolutely is a
valid subject for the Council to discuss, and it would be
better ifhe used his remarks to actually engage with the
issue at hand, rather than to insult the Council.

It was interesting to hear about the prisoner
swaps, but we are also very interested in the issues
of the detainees - ordinary people arbitrarily
detained - which a number of speakers, including
the civil society briefers, addressed this morning. I
therefore repeat my request: I would ask the Syrian
authorities to kindly provide a list of who is detained,
where they are detained, and for those people who have
died their burial sites. I would also ask that they allow,
if not the Commission of Inquiry, then the International
Committee ofthe Red Cross access to the detention sites.

Notwithstanding the parallel universe that the
Syrian representative described, there is a war in
Syria because the Syrian Government is attacking
its own people, pure and simple. The way out of that
is to cooperate with the Special Envoy in ensuring a
sustainable peace process and allowing the United
Nations to have humanitarian access and help Civilians,
as it has been trying to do since 2012.
