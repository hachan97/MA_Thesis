Mr. Polyanskiy (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation joined the consensus
on presidential statement S/PRST/2019/14 primarily
because of our serious concerns about the numerous
incidents involving terrorist and extremist groups' use
of chemical weapons in the Middle East, including for
the purposes of provocation. We urge Council members
to view this consensus as an invitation to solve
problems in a non-confrontational manner and in strict
compliance with the international legal provisions of
the Chemical Weapons Convention. We would like
to believe that in practice all States parties to the
Convention, without exception, will be able to confirm
their desire to support the integrity of the Convention,
improve the overall situation in the Organization for
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and restore its
true purpose as a strictly specialized and depoliticized
international entity.
