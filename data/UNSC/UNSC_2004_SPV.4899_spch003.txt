The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Mr. Kalomoh for introducing the report.

Before giving the floor to members of the
Council, I would like to recall that, in accordance with
the understanding reached in prior consultations, the
manner in which we will be calling on speakers invited
under rule 37 is the following: I shall not be
individually calling speakers to take a seat at the table
or to return to their seats at the side of the Council
chamber. When a speaker is to make a statement, the
conference officer will escort him or her to the table.
