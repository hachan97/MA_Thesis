The President: I thank Mr. Brammertz for his
briefing.

As has been recalled, today's Security Council
meeting will be the last for Serge Brammertz in his
capacity as Commissioner of the United Nations
International Independent Investigation Commission.
As President of the Council, I am sure that I express
the feelings of all members in warmly thanking
Commissioner Brammertz for his outstanding
performance in carrying out a difficult and challenging
mandate in a very delicate political environment. As a
result of his superb work, we know that the loss of the
Commission is the gain of the International Criminal
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, where
Mr. Brammertz will soon become Prosecutor. We wish
him all the best in that challenging new endeavour.

I should also like to take this opportunity to
warmly welcome the new Commissioner, Mr. Daniel
Bellemare. As members are aware, Mr. Bellemare will
also be Prosecutor of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon.
We wish him every success in that post.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Lebanon.
