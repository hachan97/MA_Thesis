Mr. Alarcen de Quesada (Cuba) (interpretation from Spanish): I do not want to take up much of the

 

Council's time, and it is not necessary. We did not need a
Council meeting to do what the representative of the United
States believes the Council has done. On 20 June, even
before the report of the investigative team was issued, we
heard exactly the same words from the White House. Until
yesterday the Council had an opportunity to take a decision
consistent with what it said in February. As one
representative very recently recalled, nine members of the
Council put forward ideas that would have been completely
along the lines of the conclusions of the Council of the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

One delegation, long before the meeting of the
Council and the meetings of ICAO, insisted on repeating its
lies and distorting the truth without replying to specific
questions: where are the witnesses? Where is the
recording? Is it the one that was distributed in February,
or the mutilated one given to the ICAO in May? Where
is the truth, my dear friend? Why have you, the defenders
of the truth, put so much time and effort into hiding it?
And somebody expressed surprise that we recalled the
brilliant work of Lewis Carroll.

The specialized agency of the United Nations,
ICAO, dedicated four long meetings in two days of work
to the consideration of the report, which was conducted
by civil aviation specialists. They did not do what
members of the Council, in a couple of hours, under
pressure and manipulation, have been capable of doing. I
think that the majority of members deserve a good rest.
