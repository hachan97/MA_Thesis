Mr. Sardenberg (Brazil): Brazil's affirmative
vote on resolution 1540 (2004) reflects our
unequivocal commitment to the cause of a safer world,
a world in which weapons of mass destruction -
nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons - will no
longer exist.

The underlying reasons for our vote are quite
clear. The prospect of non-State actors, especially
terrorists, having access to those weapons is indeed a
matter of deep concern. Such is the focus of the
resolution we have just adopted. In addition, a sense of
urgency was needed to address this potential threat. As
negotiations advanced, the delegation of Brazil acted in
a manner consistent with international law and the
maintenance of international peace and security. We
sought to safeguard the integrity of the existing
international treaties and conventions - including the
Non-Proliferation Treaty - and the balance of rights
and duties contained therein.

Limiting our efforts to combating proliferation or
trying to single it out as the overriding threat to our
lives seems to us somewhat inadequate. At the same
time, concrete actions towards effective disarmament
by the States possessing those arms must also be
pursued in good faith. Without such a comprehensive
approach, one that also takes into account the manifold
possibilities provided by international cooperation for
peaceful purposes, all efforts to make this a safer and
better world are bound to fall short.

Several of our contributions, as well as
amendments proposed by other delegations, were
reflected in the resolutions as adopted. Nevertheless,
we certainly continue to think that there was no need to
put the whole resolution under the enforcement
provisions of the United Nations Charter. We will take
part in the work of the committee established in
paragraph 4, with the same determination to play a
positive and catalytic role.
