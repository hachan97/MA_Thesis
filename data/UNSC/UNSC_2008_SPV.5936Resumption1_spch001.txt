The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of South Africa, in which he requests
that the Council extend an invitation under rule 39 of
its provisional rules of procedure to Mrs. Lila Hanitra
Ratsifandrihamanana, Permanent Observer of the
African Union.

It is so decided.

I would like to remind all speakers, as I indicated
in this morning's meeting, to limit their statements to
no more than five minutes, in order to enable the
Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to circulate their texts in writing and to
deliver a condensed version when speaking in this
Chamber.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Bangladesh.
