Mr. Heinbecker (Canada) (spoke in French):
Canada is deeply concerned about the cycle of violence
in the West Bank, Gaza and Israel. This violence
mocks the safety of the inhabitants and their
communities. We are firmly committed to support the
protection of all civilians.
(spoke in English)

The experience of peacekeeping has taught us the
value of clear and achievable mandates. We do not
believe that this draft mandate meets either test.
Canada would welcome any initiative - including the
concept of an observation or monitoring force - that
would succeed in stabilizing the situation in the region

and promote the protection of non-combatants. But
Canada believes that both the eventual deployment and
the effective operation of such a force would be
jeopardized if the Council were to press ahead now,
without the acceptance of both parties being assured
and an appropriate mandate being developed. Nor do
we believe that the time is right for this resolution. For
these reasons Canada has abstained on the draft
resolution.

We are certain that the Security Council should
continue to support the Secretary-General in his
efforts, as mandated by the Council, to explore options
with the parties for bringing an end to the violence and
getting them back to the negotiating table. We are
encouraged by the decision of the parties to resume
talks under the guidance of the United States. Canada
has long advocated such dialogue as the only avenue to
a just and comprehensive settlement based on
resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). In our view, the
Council should remain prepared to assist this process,
including with an observer or monitoring mission,
should one be accepted by both parties.
