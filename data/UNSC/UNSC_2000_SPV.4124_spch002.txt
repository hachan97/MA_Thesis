Mr. Tekaya (Tunisia) (spoke in French): I thank you,
Mr. President, and the other members of the Security
Council for your expression of sympathy with the
Government and the people of Tunisia in connection with
the death of our leader, President Habib Bourguiba, the
father of independent Tunisia. History will never forget the
great work he accomplished in Tunisia or that he was a
fervent advocate of just causes, supporting independence
movements in Africa and throughout the world. He was
among the founders of the Organization of African Unity
and of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. He was a
great believer in a culture of peace, tolerance and the
peaceful settlement of disputes.

May God have mercy upon him.
Expression of thanks to the retiring President
