The President (spoke in Russian): In accordance
with rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure, I invite the representative of the Syrian
Arab Republic to participate in this meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them
documents S/2019/756 and S/2019/757, which contain
the texts of two draft resolutions. The Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolutions.

I shall first give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements.
