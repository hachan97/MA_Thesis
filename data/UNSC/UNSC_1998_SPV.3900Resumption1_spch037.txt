The President: I thank the representative of the
League of Arab States for the kind words he addressed to
me and to my predecessor.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is Mr. Mokhtar
Lamani, Permanent Observer for the Organization of the
 

Islamic Conference to the United Nations, to whom the
Security Council has extended an invitation under rule 39
of its provisional rules of procedure. I invite him to take
a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
