The President: I thank the representative of
Nepal for his contributions to this debate. I also thank
him for his expression of appreciation of the
importance and the relevance of this particular open
debate on the role of civil society in post-conflict
peace-building during our presidency of the Security
Council.

I shall now give the floor to the Secretary General
of CARE International, Mr. Denis Caillaux, to respond
to comments and questions raised during the debate.
