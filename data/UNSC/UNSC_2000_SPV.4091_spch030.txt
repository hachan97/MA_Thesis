The President: Members of the Council have before
them document S/2000/29, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations.

 

It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before
it. If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft resolution to
the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, China, France,
Jamaica, Malaysia, Mali, Namibia, Netherlands,
Russian Federation, Tunisia, Ukraine, United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of
America

The President: There were 15 votes in favour. The
draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as resolution
1286 (2000).

I invite the Secretary-General to make some closing
remarks on this remarkable meeting.
