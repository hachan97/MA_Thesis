Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom has voted in favour of the resolution adopted
by the Council to renew the mandate of the United
Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara
(MINURSO) for a further six months. As the resolution
was a technical roll-over of the mandate, I would like
to set out aspects of the situation that the United
Kingdom considers to be important.

Firstly, the United Kingdom thanks the United
Nations Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy,
Mr. van Walsum, for their efforts to find a way forward
in this dispute.

The United Kingdom noted references in the
report of the Secretary-General about the human rights
06-59410
situation. The United Kingdom believes we should
continue to monitor the protection of human rights in
the region, while working to move beyond the current
impasse.

MINURSO has continued to play a stabilizing
role in the region. However, no United Nations
peacekeeping mandate should be regarded as open-
ended. After the renewal of MINURSO's mandate in
April of this year, we had hoped that there would be
steps forward on this issue and that we would not
require a purely technical roll-over at this meeting.

I would like to reiterate the United Kingdom's
desire to see progress in the next six months, beyond
the current impasse.

I would like to underline again the United
Kingdom's position that the only solution to this issue
has to be mutually acceptable and provide for the self-
determination of the people of Western Sahara, in line
with United Nations requirements as set out in
previous Security Council resolutions.
