Mr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We would like to exercise our right of reply
following the statement made by the representative of
Georgia.

We get the impression that the insinuations made
against Russia by the Georgian representative in the
Security Council without any context are very tiresome.
We have presented our position in this regard many
times, including in this Chamber. What is particularly
strange about the statement by the representative of
Georgia is that they were made following yesterday's
news concerning the statement by the Georgian Prime
Minister of his readiness to hold direct dialogue with
Russia. It is time for Georgian diplomacy to open a
new chapter in its history and to refrain from tiresome
cliches.
