Mr. Kolby (Norway): I too would like to thank
Sir Jeremy Greenstock for his excellent work as
Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC).
Norway commends him and the three Vice-Chairmen
for their dedicated efforts to implement the tasks
assigned to the Committee. We fully share the aims and
objectives outlined by him for the Committee's next
90-day working period.

Many States are in the process of finalizing their
second reports to the CTC. Norway has recently
adopted a legislative package designed to combat
terrorist acts and the financing of terrorism. Those
measures provide the basis for our second report to the
CTC. At the same time, the work of the CTC and its
experts, as well as that of other international bodies,
has to a large extent inspired the legislative process in
our country.

We remain focused on the need to assist States in
their efforts to implement resolution 1373 (2001). This
is a priority for the Committee. Norway and the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) recently agreed
on a cooperation programme to support the
implementation of resolution 1373 (2001) by OAU
member States. This year Norway will make available
approximately $210,000 for the project. Norway is also
funding a project to support and strengthen cooperation
between the countries in the Southern African
Development Community in the fight against terrorism
in the southern African region.

Norwegian efforts to combat terrorism will
continue to be broad based, including political, legal,
diplomatic and economic measures. We also consider a
strong commitment to development cooperation to be a
relevant contribution to combating terrorism by
improving socially unjustifiable conditions.
