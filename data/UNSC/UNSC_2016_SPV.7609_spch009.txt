Mr. Akahori (Japan) (spoke in Spanish):
Mr. President, I am grateful to you for having convened
this important meeting. We also highly value the
leadership of the United Kingdom, which prepared
resolution 2261 (2016) in a very effective manner. I
welcome the Foreign Minister of Colombia, Maria
Angela Holguin Cuellar, and I congratulate her on the
adoption of the resolution.

We fully support the peace process in Colombia,
and Japan had the pleasure of being a co-sponsor of the
resolution. I hope that the peace process in Colombia
will make further progress and that a final agreement
will soon be reached as a result of the adoption of the
resolution.

Japan has been cooperating in rehabilitating the
victims of the conflict and in anti-mining efforts,
among other activities, and it intends to continue its
support. Japan is also prepared to consider not only
financial support but also support in terms of human
capital for the special political mission.
