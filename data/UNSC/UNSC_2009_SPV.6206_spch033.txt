Mr. Antonio (spoke in French): Thankfully, there
were no questions addressed to the African Union, but
I could not leave this Chamber without thanking all the
members of the Security Council and all the
delegations that have taken the floor to once again
show their solidarity with Africa through their support
of the African Union. We have taken note of all the
concrete proposals that have been made, and I would
like to reaffirm the desire of the African Union to live
up to its part of the responsibilities.

At this late hour in the debate I would like to
underscore in particular Mr. Prodi's remarks at the
outset of the meeting, referred to also by some
delegations, that the issue of peacekeeping operations
is just part of the problem. There is also the need for a
comprehensive approach. In many forums, we have
analysed the deep causes of conflict in Africa, which
we must bear in mind.

We have also spoken a great deal about the need
for a capacity-building plan for the African Union. I
would like to say here that capacity-building is part of
our concerns in the African Union. As the Council
knows, the African Union's strategic plan has four
principal pillars - peace and security, peace and
development, shared values, and the building of
capacity in the African Union Commission. Thus,
capacity-building is already a part of our concerns.
Everything the African Union needs can fall within the
framework of our cooperation with all partners, in
particular the United Nations, on capacity-building.

Having said that, I would like to reiterate that the
African Union is willing to work with all partners, and
in particular the United Nations, on moving forward
with these reflections that we have begun today -
reflections which only strengthen the need for a
multilateral approach to matters regarding Africa.
