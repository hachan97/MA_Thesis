Mr. Alyas (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): Israel
continues its desperate attempts to distort the truth in
order to divert the Council's attention from what its
forces are doing to the Palestinian people. It does so by
attacking anyone who criticizes its oppressive policies
and actions, which contravene international law and
resolutions concerning Palestine. The statement
delivered by the representative of the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia this morning explained very clearly and
in detail our position with regard to Israeli distortions,
claims and lies, whether they be the ones included in
their original statement or their subsequent statement.

The representative of the Syrian regime also
continues to repeat the same false claims against
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, an indication of his
own failure and inability to divert the attention of
the Council from the crimes the Syrian regime has
committed against the Syrian people.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has repeatedly
reaffirmed its condemnation of terrorism in all its
forms and manifestations. The defeat and eradication of
terrorism require that the root causes be addressed. That
includes the practices ofthe Syrian regime, specifically
the violations committed against the Syrian people. The
representative of the Syrian regime has gone so far as
to use methods, such as the amputation of hands, arms,
and so on, against those who opposed the Syrian regime
and aspired to freedom and dignity.
