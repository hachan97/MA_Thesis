The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as the representative of Poland.

At the outset, I would like to thank Mr. Michel
Kafando, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General
for Burundi, and Ambassador Jiirg Lauber, Chair
of the Burundi configuration of the Peacebuilding
Commission, for their comprehensive briefings.

The situation in Burundi has to be seen in the
wider regional context of the Great Lakes region. It
risks deepening a humanitarian and refugee crisis
in Burundi and its neighbourhood. While thanking
international and regional mediators for the efforts so
far, we encourage the East African Community and the
African Union to increase their commitment to breaking
the political impasse and enhancing coordination of
their steps in that regard.

We recognize the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation
Agreement for Burundi, with its provisions on the
need for broad political consensus and avoiding
concentrating power in a single institution or unit as
the main instrument for peace and stability in Burundi
and in the region. Poland would like to emphasize the
particular role the leaders of neighbouring countries
and the Arusha Agreement guarantors have to play
in overcoming the causes generating instability in
the region.

Poland has concerns about the situation in
Burundi, both in the pre-referendum period and in
the tense situation after the voting. We are worried
about the deterioration of human rights and limitations
on political space for members of the opposition,
independent media and civil society. We hope that the
inter-Burundian dialogue will be continued, as only an
inclusive political dialogue can ensure a sustainable
and widely acceptable solution.

I resume my functions as President of the Council.
I give the floor to the representative of Burundi.
