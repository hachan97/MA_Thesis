Mr. Cunningham (United States of America): I
want to thank Deputy Prime Minister Covic for
travelling to New York to address the Council. It was
good to see him here again. I wish it were under better
circumstances.

My authorities have condemned in the strongest
terms the attack on and the murder of the young
Kosovars on 13 August. It was a horrible crime. Our
spokesman called it an atrocity. We would like to
extend our deepest condolences to the families. We
welcome the fact that the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK)
responded quickly and has launched an investigation
into the crime. That investigation is going on now, and
we should not draw conclusions about who is
responsible until it is complete and until those who are
responsible have been brought to justice.

We also note the statements of Kosovo Albanian
leaders, including President Rugova and Prime
Minister Rexhepi, deploring the criminal events. We
also note and welcome statements by leaders of Serbia
and Montenegro calling for a responsible reaction to
the events, such as the statement made by Defence
Minister Tadic, that Serbia and Montenegro will
address all problems in a rational way and will remain
committed to the peace process.

What we need to see is resolve and commitment
to pursuing that process. Those violent acts, which
should be punished, are damaging to the future of all
Kosovars, and the perpetrators must be brought to
justice. We are confident that UNMIK will do
everything possible to see that is done.

However, the best homage that we can pay the
victims of that violence is to redouble efforts to create
the conditions for a multi-ethnic Kosovo and for the
full implementation of resolution 1244 (1999). That is
an effort in which the new Special Representative, Mr.
Holkeri, is now fully engaged, and in which he has my
Government's very firm and determined support.
