Mr. Bonne (France) (Spoke in French): I should
first like to thank Ambassador Takasu for his 90-day
report, his management of the Committee established
pursuant to resolution 1737 (2006), the high quality of
his work in the leadership of the Committee and the
competence of his team.

The general context is known to all. Iran has
answered none of the questions that the international
community has asked it; on the contrary, it has piled
provocation upon provocation. These include in
particular the discovery of a clandestine enrichment
site at Qom and the launching of its 20 per cent
enrichment programme. Iran refuses to cooperate with
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),
continues to rebuff any serious negotiation, and
engages only in delaying tactics.

All of this led us to adopt resolution 1929 (2010).
As we have often reiterated, the door to dialogue
always remains open and we seek a diplomatic solution
above all. We therefore express our strong desire for
Iran to respond positively to the questions put to it by
the IAEA and not to hinder its investigations.

The latest report of the 1737 Committee shows
that Member States take the implementation of
resolutions concerning Iran very seriously. Such
implementation will be even more pressing with
respect to the imminent establishment of the panel of
experts under resolution 1929 (2010). Today's report
highlights violations that should be investigated. We
encourage all States to cooperate with the 1737
Committee and the panel of experts so that the
investigations may take place in optimal conditions.
More generally, we stress that each of us must fully
implement the relevant resolutions, starting with
resolution 1929 (2010), and that this is critical to
ensuring the success of the dual-track strategy adopted
and favoured by the international community.
