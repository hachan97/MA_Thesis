The President: I wish to remind all speakers to limit
their statements to no more than four minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
To that end, I take this opportunity to remind speakers
that the presidency will use the flashing lights on the
collars of the microphones to prompt them to bring their
remarks to a close. Delegations with lengthy statements
are kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing and
to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber. 1 would also like to inform everybody that
we will be carrying on the open debate right through
the lunch hour, as we have a large number of speakers.

I now give the floor to the Minister for Foreign
Trade and Development Cooperation of the Netherlands.
