The President: On behalf of the Council, I would
like to express our gratitude to Mr. Youssef Mahmoud,
who today gave his final briefing to the Council in his
capacity as Special Representative of the Secretary-
General and Head of the United Nations Mission in the
Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT). We
have appreciated his leadership of MINURCAT and we
wish him every success in his future endeavours.
There are no further speakers on my list. In
accordance with the understanding reached in the
Council's prior consultations, I invite Council members
to informal consultations to continue our discussion on
this subject.
