Mr. Khalid (Pakistan): My delegation also
wishes to thank Mr. Guehenno and Mr. Ramcharan for
their very comprehensive briefings today.

The reports of horrendous atrocities committed in
Ituri, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, are
highly disturbing, to say the least. We share the
sentiments of outrage that have been expressed around
this table, and we strongly believe that there should be
no impunity for the perpetrators of such crimes.

The reports, nevertheless, strengthen the case for
an expanded and robust presence of the United Nations
Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (MONUC) in Ituri. Pakistan fully supports
that proposal - made by the Secretary-General and
others - and will continue to work with other Council
members to translate it into reality. We also welcome
the formation of the transitional Government in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and we urge all
parties concerned to fully abide by the agreements they
have concluded.

But to those brief remarks, in deference to the
President's request to make this an interactive session,
I would just add the following questions. First, what
are the prospects for convincing those factions which
have agreed to participate in the transitional
Government to lay down their arms and to begin work
in earnest to form a unified national army?

Secondly, what will be the mechanism to prevent
those combatants and commanders who have been
involved in committing atrocities and other such
heinous crimes from joining the national army?

My last question is addressed to Mr. Ramcharan:
how does the United Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights wish to follow up on the findings of the
Mambasa and Drodro studies in order to bring to
justice the perpetrators of those crimes?
