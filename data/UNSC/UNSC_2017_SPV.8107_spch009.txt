Mr. Skoog (Sweden): I will be brief. In my grief,
I do not need to repeat what I said in the Chamber
yesterday (see S/PV.8105) about the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint
Investigative Mechanism (JIM) and the importance of
maintaining it. We appreciate the efforts made by you,
Mr. President, and other partners in trying your very
best to extend the mandate of the JIM. We deeply regret
that again this was not possible. We believe that we all
as, members of the Council, have the responsibility to
do everything possible to ensure accountability for the
use of chemical weapons and that there is no further
proliferation of such weapons.

Therefore we ask that informal consultations
be convened immediately following this meeting to
ensure that we are absolutely convinced that we have
exhausted every avenue and every effort before the
mandate of the JIM. expires later tonight.
