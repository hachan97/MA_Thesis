Mr. Shen B0 (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
voted to in favour of resolution 2357 (2017), which
the Security Council just adopted. China supports the
international community in taking effective measures
to implement the provisions of the Council's resolutions
on the arms embargo against Libya, especially to cut off
the channels and networks that terrorist organizations
use to smuggle and acquire weapons. States should
implement resolution 2357 (2017) as well as resolution
2292 (2016) in a comprehensive and accurate manner,
strictly abide by the relevant principles of international
law and respect the sovereignty and legitimate rights
and interests of flag States. Measures taken by States
should not infringe upon the exclusive jurisdiction of
flag States over their ships.

Promoting a political solution to the Libyan issue
is the only correct choice, and should be the focus of
the efforts of all parties. The international community
should support the good offices of the United Nations,
step up efforts to promote dialogue and peace and push
the Libyan parties to resolve their differences through
dialogue and consultation, so as to find a solution
acceptable to them all, restore national governance
and achieve national reconciliation. That is also the
fundamental way to resolve the problem of illegal arms
trafficking.

The meeting rose at 10.25 am.
