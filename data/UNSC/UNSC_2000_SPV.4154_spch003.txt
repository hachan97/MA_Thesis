The President (spoke in French): I thank Mr.
Klein for his invitation to members of the Council to
come see for themselves the work accomplished by the
United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

I should like to say that, as is customary,
yesterday I had a meeting with representatives of the
troop-contributing countries. Their comments and
questions dealt with the criteria for selecting
international police officers, including the criterion for
the working language, and the creation of the police
service for the courts. The Special Representative was
present at that meeting and provided answers to these
questions. In addition, I am very pleased to say that,
during the meeting, some countries announced that
they would be increasing their contributions.

I now call on members ofthe Council.
