Mr. Clay (United Kingdom): The United Kingdom
welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 2464
(2019), renewing the mandate of the Panel of Experts.
The work of the Panel is critical in ensuring that
sanctions are implemented effectively and in reporting
on those areas where sanctions evasions are occurring.
The Council agreed unanimously on these sanctions
measures and, with the support of the Panel, we must
ensure that sanctions are implemented fully, whether
that is with respect to imports of refined petroleum
or to expelling Democratic People's Republic of
Korea labourers.
Some States, including the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, seek to blame sanctions for the
humanitarian situation. The inadequate provision
of humanitarian support and assistance is due to the
Government policies of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, not to sanctions. This includes
the diversion of billions of dollars towards prohibited
nuclear and ballistic missile programmes and a refusal
to allow the international community to monitor
aid distribution.

Security Council sanctions resolutions on
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have
been designed with exemptions intended to avoid
humanitarian impacts. It is right that we can continue to
monitor how effectively the humanitarian exemptions
process operates through the Committee established
pursuant to resolution 1718 (2006).

The meeting rose at 5.55 pm.
