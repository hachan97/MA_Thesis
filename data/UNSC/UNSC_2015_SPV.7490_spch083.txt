Mr. Al-Mouallimi (Saudi Arabia): The
representative of Israel has chosen to give us a most
melodramatic finale in which he opened fire on just
about everybody. It is ironic that the representative
of Israel can stand here and give all of us a lecture on
the protection of civilians in time of war. Israel has
written the book on killing civilians in warfare. Israel
is the ultimate authority in that area, having murdered
thousands of Palestinians just one year ago in Gaza.

Now the latest version of Israel's protection of
human rights is to defend the rights of criminals. I say to
the representative of Israel that if my country executes
criminals, his country is deliberately killing innocent
civilians children, women and men, day and night,
and has been doing that for a very long time. I think that
it is high time for the Council to put an end to Israeli
arrogance and double standards and to ensure that Israel
complies with the rules of the civilized community of
nations and ceases its occupation of Arab territories in
Palestine, Syria and Lebanon.
