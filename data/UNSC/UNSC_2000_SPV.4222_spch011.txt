Mr. Uanivi (Namibia): Thank you, Mr. President,
for convening this meeting. I would also like to
thank Mr. Guehenno, Under-Secretary-General for
Peacekeeping Operations, for his useful briefing on the
elections held on 11 November in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.

When we look at what has been achieved in
Bosnia and Herzegovina five years after the
implementation of the Dayton Peace Accords with the
assistance of the international community, we all agree
that there is peace and progress in that country,
however limited it may be. Indeed, our assessment is
that overall progress has been very slow and that
political will has been lacking in the leadership in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, the ground has
been shifting, albeit slowly, in favour of those who
wish to see a multi-ethnic, democratic Bosnia and
Herzegovina. Therefore, my delegation urges the
authorities in both entities to take their responsibility
seriously and to cooperate fully with the institutions
and representatives of the international community to
make sure that their country does not revert to war.

The international community has spent a great
deal of time and effort in Bosnia in order not to allow
62 per cent of young Bosnians to think that their future
lies elsewhere in Europe, rather than in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. We think that the assistance of the
international community is vital in convincing those
young Bosnians that their future in Europe depends on
their ability to bring a united, democratic and multi-
ethnic Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European table.
In this context, we are grateful to hear that the
elections have proceeded smoothly, and we hope that
all parties will respect the outcome.

Finally, we believe that the new political climate
in the region will be able to provide wisdom and
ultimately free those who have become hostage to their
own narrow interests - those who believe that their
interests will be protected by hatred and intolerance.
