Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): I would
like to thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his
briefing. China has been closely following developments
in the situation on the ground in Ukraine, which
remains highly complex and sensitive as we speak. The
situation in Ukraine today is the result of a complex
interlinkage among historic factors and circumstances
on the ground.

China regrets the recent clashes that took place
in the streets of Kyiv. China also condemns acts of
extremism and violence. Efforts to address Ukrainian
affairs should take the lawful rights and interests of
all ethnic communities in Ukraine into consideration
with a View to restoring the normal social order as soon
as possible. On several public occasions, China has
clearly stated its principled position on the question of
Ukraine. It continues to address the issue objectively
and impartially. It is China's long-standing position not
to interfere in the internal affairs of other States and to
respect their sovereignty and territorial integrity.

My country is of the View that all parties must
now remain calm, exercise restraint, prevent a further
escalation of the situation, and adhere to the approach
of resolving the crisis through political and diplomatic
channels. It is our hope that all parties concerned will
promote communication and coordination, put the
interests of all ethnic communities in Ukraine above
everything else, keep their eyes on the big picture of
maintaining regional peace and stability, and settling
their differences by appropriate means.

China supports the constructive efforts and good
offices of the international community in de-escalating
the situation in Ukraine. We are open to all proposals
and plans that would help to ease tensions in the country.
We remain committed to playing a constructive role
in achieving a political settlement of the question of
Ukraine.
