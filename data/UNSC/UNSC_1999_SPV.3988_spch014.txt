Mr. Dangue Rewaka (Gabon) (spoke in French):
The delegation of Gabon has always supported the efforts
made by the Contact Group to lead the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia to grant greater autonomy to its Kosovo
province.

Like the members of the Contact Group, we have
condemned the acts of terrorism committed by the
Kosovo Liberation Army. We have also condemned the
repressive measures taken against these acts. It is
regrettable that all of these condemnations and these
appeals aimed at achieving a political solution to the
question of Kosovo were not heeded.

In spite of this silence, we would have hoped that
the Contact Group would continue to use all its authority
to compel the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to sign the
Rambouillet agreement, which gave rise to new hopes for
a settlement of the situation in Kosovo.

My Government is in principle opposed to the use of
force to settle local or international disputes.
