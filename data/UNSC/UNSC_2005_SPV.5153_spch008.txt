Mr. Holliday (United States of America): I had
not intended to take the floor, but I want to reflect on
what we have done here. Twelve members of the
Council, including two African States, voted for this
resolution, which we hope will address the situation in
Darfur.

However, I have to defend the honour of the
United States Congress. Many of the members of
Congress care deeply about the issue, and many of
them have gone to Darfur and actually had firsthand
experience working with some of the non-
governmental organizations there. We know that they
and all of us in the United States hope that this
resolution will contribute to an end to the violence in
Darfur and to a successful resolution of the Abuja
peace process.
