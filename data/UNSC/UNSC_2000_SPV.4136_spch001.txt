The President (spoke in Chinese): In accordance with
the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall take
it that the Security Council agrees to extend an invitation
under rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure to
Mr. Wolfgang Petritsch, High Representative for the
Implementation of the Peace Agreement on Bosnia and
Herzegovina.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Petritsch to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting
in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them a letter
dated 4 May 2000 from the Secretary-General addressed to
the President of the Security Council, transmitting a letter
dated 3 May 2000 from the High Representative for the
Implementation of the Peace Agreement on Bosnia and
Herzegovina, enclosing his report, document S/2000/376.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Wolfgang Petritsch, High Representative
for the Implementation of the Peace Agreement on Bosnia
and Herzegovina.

I call on Mr. Petritsch.
