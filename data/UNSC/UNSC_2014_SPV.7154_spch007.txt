Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): The
United Kingdom is gravely concerned by events in
eastern Ukraine, which have escalated over the past
48 hours, with armed men seizing control of Government
buildings and erecting checkpoints and barricades in
six different cities. Street protests have given way to
violent action. That is a dangerous escalation of an
already dangerous situation.

We have all seen the video footage of events over
the weekend: professional, well-armed and well-
equipped units wearing identical uniforms conducting
coordinated military operations against Ukrainian State
institutions. That is a pattern that is all too familiar.
Coming just weeks after Russian troops illegally
deployed to Crimea while wearing uniforms without
insignia, these events point clearly to Russia once again
interfering directly in the internal affairs of Ukraine
while using manufactured pretexts and military
force. Such actions are contrary to international law,
have already been condemned by the international
community and have been declared invalid by the
General Assembly.

As a Member of the United Nations, and as a
permanent member of the Security Council, Russia is
obliged to refrain from the threat or use of force against
the territorial integrity and political independence
of any State. Yet satellite images show that there are
between 35,000 and 40,000 Russian troops in the
vicinity of the border with Ukraine, equipped with
combat aircraft, tanks, artillery and logistical support
units. That is in addition to the 25,000 Russian troops
based illegally in Crimea.

Just as six weeks ago Russia denied deploying its
troops to Crimea, it also now denies that it has amassed
troops on Ukraine's eastern border. It claims that the
publicly available satellite images illustrating that troop
deployment were taken in August 2013. That is false;
additional images released on 11 April show clearly
that the build-up started in early March of this year.

Russia's aggressive stance is a clear threat to the
sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity
of Ukraine. The United Kingdom calls on Russia
immediately to redeploy its troops away from the
border, cease all activity designed to heighten tensions
and sow discord, and revoke the mandate given by the
Federation Council on 1 March to use military force on
Ukrainian soil.

The Russian Federation has made little secret of
its efforts to undermine the process of reconciliation
in Ukraine. Rather than assisting its neighbours in
rebuilding their country after the fall of a deeply corrupt
regime that left the nation on the verge of bankruptcy,
Russia has instead sought to destabilize the country
further in pursuit of its narrow interests. Russia must
desist from those steps and address whatever grievances
it has through dialogue, starting with the contact group
talks scheduled for this coming week.

The international community is not fooled by the
Kremlin's use of propaganda and misinformation to
spread fears among the population of eastern Ukraine.
Contrary to Russian claims, the recent demonstrations
in eastern cities are not organic. They do not enjoy
widespread support, and the numbers of genuine
protestors on the streets pale in comparison to the
crowds of hundreds of thousands who protested against
the former regime. Rather, what we are witnessing is
a well-orchestrated campaign designed to destabilize
the country. If Russia really has genuine concerns
about Ukraine's Russian-speaking population, then its
actions have done nothing to safeguard their interests.
The illegal annexation of Crimea, stoking tensions
and provoking violence in eastern Ukraine, hurt and
endanger all the people of Ukraine.

The special monitoring mission of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the United
Nations human rights monitoring mission are in Ukraine
to observe the situation and report on developments.
Their presence is designed to safeguard the rights of
all the citizens of Ukraine. We look forward to their
assessment of the situation and we fully support their
work.

Russia is seeking to impose its will on the people
of Ukraine by using misinformation, intimidation and
aggression - tactics drawn from the darkest days of
the past century. That is completely unacceptable. The
Ukrainian people have the right to determine their own
future free from Russian interference.

On 25 May Ukraine will elect a new president.
The Ukrainian Government has stated clearly that
its programme of constitutional reform will include
discussions on the degree of autonomy devolved to
Ukraine's regions. That is a clear pathway to resolve
differences through peaceful, constitutional means.
The use of armed force that we are now witnessing
in eastern Ukraine to impose one set of views on
the peaceful majority is therefore entirely without
justification. Moscow must reject these latest unlawful
actions, and do so publicly.
