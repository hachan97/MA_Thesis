The President: Please allow me two minutes to
make a concluding statement on behalf of the Council.
I would like to conclude today's debate by underlining
a few facts that can be taken from virtually all
statements made today.

First, business indeed does have an important role
to play in conflict resolution. Secondly, the modalities
of engagement of the private sector may vary according
to the circumstances of the case, but we have a number
of examples with lessons learned both at the national
and the regional levels. Thirdly, while there will be no
guarantee for the successful resolution of a conflict
because of private sector engagement, it seems clear
that without participation of business, resolving violent
conflicts will be virtually impossible.

Fourthly and lastly, the main United Nations
bodies, as well as the major stakeholders within and
outside the United Nations system, including the World
Bank and other international financial institutions,
should work together in close partnership with the
private sector in creating the necessary political,
security, economic and financial framework. I hope
that this debate can contribute to further enhancing the
role of the private sector in conflict prevention,
peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building. I intend
to circulate a summary of this meeting in due course.

Finally, I would like to thank all speakers for
their contributions, but particularly our guest speakers,
whose engagement in today's discussion has
highlighted the importance of the issue at stake. We all
appreciate very much that they made the effort to come
here to participate in our discussion.

There are no more speakers on my list.

The Security Council has concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 1.20 17.171.
