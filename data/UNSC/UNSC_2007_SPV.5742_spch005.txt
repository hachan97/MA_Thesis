The President (spoke in French): I should like to
make a statement in my national capacity simply to
reaffirm France's support for the work of Ms. Carla del
Ponte, its appreciation for her achievements at the
Tribunal, and its firm resolve to continue to cooperate
fully with the Tribunal in the pursuit of its tasks.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 10.20 am.
