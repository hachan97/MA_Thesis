Mr. Pressman (United States of America): I would
like to begin by thanking Foreign Secretary Johnson for
his presence here today and for the United Kingdom's
leadership on this issue.

The United States strongly endorses the
authorization of Member States to assist in the transfer
and destruction of Libya's Category 2 chemical
weapons outside of Libya. We are pleased that the
Security Council was able to respond to the initiative
of the Libyan Government of National Accord, working
with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons and the international community, to facilitate
the transfer and destruction of these chemicals.

It was imperative that we act quickly in this
instance to remove these chemicals in order to prevent
possible capture and use by non-State actors. As such,
we appreciate the United Kingdom's approach as
penholder in presenting a clean and simple authorization
for immediate action to address a threat to international
peace and security. These efforts will help ensure that
the chemicals are safely and securely destroyed in a
verifiable manner, and we are hopeful that all members
of the Security Council recognize the importance of
undertaking this action in an expedited manner.

We look forward to our continued work with the
international community to ensure these Category 2
chemical weapons are safely destroyed.
