The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now make
a statement in my capacity as representative of Chile.

We would like to thank Mr. Jeffrey Feltman for his
briefing on the recent events in Ukraine.

We join in the condemnation of the indiscriminate
shelling of residential areas in the city of Mariupol,
an attack that constitutes a significant and worrying
escalation of the level of violence in eastern Ukraine.
Those responsible for such deplorable acts against
the civilian population must be held accountable, and
we emphasize the absolute necessity for an objective
investigation of the facts that will see that those
responsible are brought to justice.

The violence must end so that Ukrainians can
rebuild their lives in a stable and secure country,
while maintaining its sovereignty and territorial
integrity in accordance with the Charter of the United
Nations. We urge the parties to fully implement the
Minsk agreements, which, along with the ceasefire
memorandum of 19 September, have laid the foundations
and established the criteria for a negotiated solution to
the crisis.

We furthermore recall that in Minsk all parties
agreed to allow the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to monitor and verify
the ceasefire. We emphasize our support for the OSCE'S
Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine and urge the
parties to cooperate with its mandate, particularly
through support for the delivery of humanitarian aid.
I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Ukraine.
