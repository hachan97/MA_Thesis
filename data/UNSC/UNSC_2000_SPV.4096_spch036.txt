The President: I thank the Foreign Minister of South
Africa for coming back today. I think that her point-by-
point comments on so much of what has been said are
tremendously valuable. We thank her and would ask her to
convey our great appreciation to President Mbeki for
sending her here as his personal representative and to
former President Mandela for making this long trip to
report to us.
