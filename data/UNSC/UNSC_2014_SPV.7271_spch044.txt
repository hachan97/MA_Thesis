The President: Let me say that we all join in
congratulating Mr. Timmermans on the new role that he
will be playing. We are glad his passion and eloquence
are going to be continuing to fight for the principles
that bring him here.

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Sameh
Hassan Shokry Selim, Minister for Foreign Affairs of
Egypt. I want to thank Mr. Selim for his significant
efforts in the past months on a number of different
fronts. We truly appreciate Egypt's leadership on the
ceasefire and engagement with respect to this issue,
Libya and others.
