Mr. Richmond (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland): Ten years after the United Nations first
became involved in Angola and four years after the signing
of the Lusaka Protocol, the peace process ought to be on
the verge of completion. Instead, it is edging dangerously
close to collapse. It is not too late to pull back from the
brink, but whether the Angolan people are dragged into
further conflict or the peace process is put back on track
depends on the Government of Angola, and above all on
UNITA.

We commend the Secretary-General's decision to
send Mr. Brahimi to Angola and the appointment of Mr.
Diallo as his new Special Representative. Both face
enormously difficult tasks. They have our full support.
But their efforts can succeed only if the parties
themselves exercise restraint. A failure to do so will have
disastrous consequences. There is a particular onus on
UNITA to honour its obligations. It must end its
prevarication and complete the tasks remaining, as set out
in the Lusaka Protocol and reiterated in the draft
resolution before us today. It must now cooperate in the
extension of State administration to all areas of Angola;
it must demilitarize its forces and cease armed attacks;
and it must complete the transformation of UNITA into
a political organization.

The international community has invested great
effort in trying to bring peace to Angola. It is a vital
contribution to the peace and development of southern
Africa as a whole. There is an urgent need for
recommitment by all sides to the Lusaka process. We
hope that, under the guidance of the Secretary-Generals
Special Representative and with the support of the region,
the leaders of the Government and of UNITA will take
the necessary steps to revitalize the peace process.
