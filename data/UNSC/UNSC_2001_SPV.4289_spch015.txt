Mr. Ouane (Mali) (spoke in French): I, too,
would like to thank Mr. Kerim, Minister for Foreign
Affairs of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
for his statement. I note that the information he gave to
the Council confirms that there has been a deterioration
of the situation on the border between the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Kosovo. Like
other delegations, we are deeply concerned over the
escalation of tension in the Presevo Valley and the
increase in violence in the north of Macedonia. We
strongly condemn the violent and illegal terrorist acts
committed by extremist groups in the region, especially
the death of three soldiers last week. We also support
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and we urge all the
parties concerned to show restraint, because we are
convinced that the current situation can be resolved
only through political means.

My delegation also welcomes the signing, on 1
March 2001, of a border demarcation agreement
between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

Finally, I would like to say that my delegation
remains committed to the search for a comprehensive
solution to the problem in the Balkans and expresses its
support of my delegation for the presidential statement
that we will adopt after this meeting.
