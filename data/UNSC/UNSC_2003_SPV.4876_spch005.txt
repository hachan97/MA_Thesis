The President (spoke in French): As there is no
list of speakers, I invite those members of the Council
who wish to take the floor to make comments or put
questions to the Deputy President of South Africa or
the President of the Economic and Social Council to so
indicate to the Secretariat as of now.

I see that some delegations have done so.
