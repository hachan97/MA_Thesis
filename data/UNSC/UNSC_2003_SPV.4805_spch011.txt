Ms. Menendez (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): My
delegation would like to thank Ambassador Sinclair for
his briefing today and to congratulate him on his work
at the head of the United Nations Political Office in
BougainVille (UNPOB).

We have noted with satisfaction the positive
developments in the fields of disarmament and the
political process in preparation for autonomy, despite
the fragility of the processes, about which Ambassador
Sinclair himself informed us.

Actually, I have little to add to what was said by
the delegations that preceded me, so I shall limit
myself to asking a question of Mr. Sinclair. In his
statement, the subject of cooperation between UNPOB
and the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) to ensure a smooth and effective transition in
the post-UNPOB phase was very interesting to me. He
said that there is a series of consultations between
UNPOB and the UNDP on a number of issues to
develop joint efforts and a joint approach. I should like
to know if he could be a bit more specific as to what
those areas of cooperation would be in order to ensure
such an effective and smooth transition in the future.
