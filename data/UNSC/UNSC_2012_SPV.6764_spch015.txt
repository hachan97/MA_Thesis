Mr. Cabral (Portugal): I, too, would like to
congratulate you, Sir, on assuming the presidency and
to assure you of our full cooperation. I thank
Ambassador Susan Rice and all of the American
delegation for a most successful presidency.

Portugal is extremely concerned about the
situation in the Sudan and South Sudan. We supported
and voted in favour of resolution 2046 (2012), fully
convinced that the Council has the essential
responsibility to react to and to act under these
circumstances and following the decisions taken by the
African Union Peace and Security Council on 24 April.
We urge both parties sitting at this table with us today
to respond favourably and immediately to the demands
of the Council and of the African Union and fulfil the
requirements contained in resolution 2046 (2012),
namely, the ceasing of all hostilities and the return to
negotiations under the auspices of the African Union
High-level Implementation Panel.

We would also like to underline the importance
we attach to paragraphs 4 and 7 of the resolution, on
issues of humanitarian assistance and on the promotion
and protection of human rights.
