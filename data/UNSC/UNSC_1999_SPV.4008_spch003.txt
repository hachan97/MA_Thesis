Sir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): This draft
resolution in front of us reflects the Council's desire to
continue the humanitarian programme, and the United
Kingdom welcomes that. Discussions amongst members of
the Council continue on the Council's broader approach to
Iraq. We hope that these discussions will soon reach a
comprehensive conclusion compatible with the Council's
present resolutions, and we will work hard to that end.

In addition to rolling over the programme for a further
180 days, this draft resolution indicates the Council's
intention to keep the programme under review, including,
if necessary, by adjusting the ceiling for Iraq's oil exports
to fund the humanitarian programme. The discussions on
the recommendations of the panel on the humanitarian side
and this draft resolution together underline the Council's
firm and united support for the humanitarian programme
and its determination to improve the situation of the Iraqi
people. We call on the Government of Iraq themselves to
cooperate constructively in the implementation of this
programme to ensure that the full potential of the
programme to meet the needs of the Iraqi people is
realized. That will make a greater immediate difference
within the framework of the Council's decisions on this
issue than any other single measure.
Mention has been made of the activity in the no-fly
zones. There is a simple way to reduce tension. Iraq
should cease targeting coalition aircraft. The United
Kingdom's operations are purely reactive. We do not
initiate aggressive action and if we react we target
relevant military facilities only. The no-fly zones are
necessary in order to limit Iraq's capacity to oppress its
own people and in order to monitor its compliance with
its obligations under Security Council resolution 688
(1991).
