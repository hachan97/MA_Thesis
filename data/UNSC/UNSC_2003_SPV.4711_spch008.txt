Sir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): First
of all, I should like to express the United Kingdom's
sincere condolences to Pakistan and Afghanistan with
regard to the crash of the Cessna. A particular loss, in
the context of today's debate, is that of the Afghan
Minister for Mines and Industry, Mr. Juma Mohammed
Mohammedi, and we mourn that loss.

We very much appreciate this morning's briefings
by Under-Secretary-General Guehenno, Ambassador
Nishimura and Ambassador Braun, and we are very
grateful to the Japanese Government for its input on
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and to
the German Government for what it is doing on the
Ministry of the Interior and on police reform.

I should like to seek a bit more detail from
Ambassador Braun about the reconstruction
programme in the Ministry of the Interior. It was very
useful to hear the details in his briefing, and the
intended structures seem very sensible, but how is the
programme getting on with the recruitment of Afghan
individuals for the jobs that are being laid out in the
structure? Does the German programme think that, if
the money is there, the right individuals with the
minimum qualifications can be found to fill out the
structure and the system within the time period that he
has laid out?

With regard to international involvement, it was
interesting to hear of the contributions of Nordic
countries and of others. Is this international support
broad enough, and is he looking for further particular
input from the international community that we can get
our Governments to look at specifically?
