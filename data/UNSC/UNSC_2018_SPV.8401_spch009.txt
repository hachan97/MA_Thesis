The President (spoke in Chinese): I will now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of China.

China is in favour of resolution 2446 (2018),
which the Council just adopted. The United Nations
Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in
the Central African Republic has played an important
role in maintaining peace and stability in the Central
African Republic, and China supports the renewal of
its mandate.

At the same time, the efforts of the relevant parties
of the international community to promote peace
and security in the country must be recognized and
acknowledged and the legitimate concerns of all the
parties, particularly the Central African Republic,
given full attention and taken into account. The
resolution should help forge consensus in the Council,
maintain its unity and send a positive message about the
international community's support to the Government
of the Central African Republic. Only by doing so can
we help to maintain lasting peace and stability in the
Central African Republic.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

There are no more names inscribed on the list

of speakers.

The meeting rose at 9.55 am.
