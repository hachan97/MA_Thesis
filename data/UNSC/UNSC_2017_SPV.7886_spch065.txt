Archbishop Auza (Holy See): I would like to
express the deepest sympathies of my delegation to the
Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation at the
passing of Ambassador Vitaly Churkin.

With this intervention the Holy See wishes to
reiterate its closeness to and solidarity with all peoples
afflicted by conflicts and aggression of any kind,
including so-called hybrid wars and frozen situations.
At the same time, it is the obligation of States to refrain
from actions that destabilize neighbouring countries
and work together to create the necessary conditions for
peace and reconciliation. The Holy See has been and
remains deeply concerned that, after the tragedies of
two world wars and the positive experience of European
integration and security cooperation, Europe continues
to be a theatre of conflicts causing great distress to
entire populations, like those in Cyprus, in the Balkans
and in the Caucasus.

Concerning the conflict in Ukraine, which
continues to cause grave concern since it began in 2014,
the Holy See underscores once again that all necessary
steps should be taken to enforce the ceasefire and to
implement the measures agreed upon. These efforts
should be accompanied by the sincere commitment
of all parties involved to respecting all fundamental
human rights and restoring stability at the national and
international levels, not least by respecting international
legality with regard to Ukraine's territory and borders.

By committing itselfto offering direct humanitarian
assistance to the population of the affected areas, the
Holy See stresses the need to protect civilians and the
urgency of making every possible effort to avoid the
continuation of this unresolved conflict and to find a
political solution through dialogue and negotiation. In
this regard, the Holy See continues to welcome every
effort of the United Nations, the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe and other relevant
organizations to promote peace throughout Europe,
including in Ukraine.
