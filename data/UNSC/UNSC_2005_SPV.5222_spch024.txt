The President: There are no further speakers
inscribed on my list. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.

I should like to inform the members of the
Council that, in the course of this meeting, I have
learned that the term of office of Assistant Secretary-
General Danilo Turk is ending in three or four days.
Therefore, I would like to express to him - I am sure,
with members' agreement - our thanks and
appreciation for his continued cooperation with the
Council as a whole and with its members and to wish
him the best in his endeavours in the future.

The meeting rose at 12 noon.
