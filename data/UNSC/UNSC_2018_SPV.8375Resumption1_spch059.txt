Mr. Bourgel (Israel): I have asked for the floor
to comment on some of the remarks made here earlier
today, and I will do my best to be brief, which I am sure
that you, Madam, will appreciate after so many hours
in the Chair.

With regard to the comment made by the
representative of Iran, it is worthwhile to remind
Member States of exactly who was talking. The Islamic
Republic of Iran is the world's leading State-sponsor of
terrorism. It spends approximately $7 billion each year
funding its proxies and terrorist organizations, at the
expense of its own citizens. Iranian-made and Iranian-
supplied weapons are fuelling conflicts and promoting
terror around the world, especially in Syria, Lebanon
and Yemen. Iran's activities violate multiple Security
Council resolutions. Iran was also recently caught
trying to murder European citizens on European soil.

When it comes to Israel, Iran's end goal is undeniable.
The Supreme Leader of Iran himself set a timetable of
25 years until the destruction of my country. It is the
moral obligation of the international community to take
concrete actions against those who insist on fuelling
violence, promoting terrorism and doing their utmost
to undermine global peace and security.

It is, perhaps, a vain exercise to respond to the
elucubrations of the representative of the Syrian
regime. Therefore, I will just mention that his absurd
accusations against Israel will certainly not distract
the world from the atrocities committed by the Syrian
regime against its own people.

It was probably also surprising to hear the Lebanese
representative lecture Israel while Hizbullah, an
internationally designated terrorist organization, plays
an open, active and prominent role in the Lebanese
Government. The result is that over 100,000 rockets are
on the northern border of Israel, as Hizbullah's fanatics
threaten the stability of the Middle East.
