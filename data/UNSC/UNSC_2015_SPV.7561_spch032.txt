The President: I wish to remind everyone to please
stay within the four-minute time limit that we have set
out and on which the Council has agreed on numerous
occasions in the past. There are so many people who
want to participate in this debate, and I want to be fair
to all of them.

I now give the floor to the representative of Brazil.
