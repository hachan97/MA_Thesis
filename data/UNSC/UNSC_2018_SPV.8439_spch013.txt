Mr. Polyanskiy (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian delegation voted in favour
of resolution 2451 (2018) on Yemen, which was
submitted by the United Kingdom, based on the fact
that it seeks to strengthen the agreements reached in
Sweden through the mediation work of the Special
Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen, Mr. Martin
Griffiths. It is most important that the document was
supported by the Yemenis themselves and regional
players, whose opinion is crucial to ensuring the
resolution's effectiveness.

We trust that by continuing to work together in
the future, we will be able to achieve a comprehensive
ceasefire in the country and help the millions of Yemeni
residents who are in dire need of some kind ofassistance.
There is a need to support the implementation of the
agreements reached in the first round of intra-Yemeni
consultations and to provide further assistance to the
mediation work of Mr. Martin Griffiths, including in
the context of organizing a new round of negotiations
early next year.
