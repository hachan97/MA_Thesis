The President: I apologize, Mr. Ambassador, for
not having begun by welcoming you to the United
Nations and to the Security Council. I know this is your
first appearance here, Ambassador Vento. We welcome
you. We are delighted you are with us.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of New Zealand. I invite him to take a seat
at the Council table and to make his statement.
