Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I will not take up much of anyone's time. I apologize to Mr. Griffiths and Mr. Rajasingham, who have had their briefings hijacked by this attention. I would like to thank everybody for their incredibly kind words and all their friendship and cooperation and that of all their missions during my time in the Council. I am incredibly lucky to have been able to serve at the United Nations. I am very proud to be part of the United Nations family. I cannot put it better than my own Foreign Secretary who says that the United Nations is a force for good. I think we can remember that every day as we go about our work. I thank everyone very much indeed.
