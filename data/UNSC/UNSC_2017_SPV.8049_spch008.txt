Mr. Seck (Senegal) (spoke in French): The delegation
of Senegal commends the unanimous adoption by the
Security Council of resolution 2377 (2017), approving
the Secretary-General's recommendations with regard
to the size, operational modalities and the mandate of
the United Nations Verification Mission in Colombia.
The new Mission, created pursuant to resolution 2366
(2017), testifies to the considerable progress achieved by
the Colombian Government and the Fuerza Alternativa
Revolucionaria del Comun as part of the process of
laying down arms. This new promising phase will
enable the parties to take the necessary steps for a
political, economic and social resolution of the crisis.

Senegal welcomes the political will demonstrated,
which has allowed all these results to be realized and
encourages the parties to continue along this promising
path. The announcement of the signing of a ceasefire
agreement between the Government of Colombia and
the National Liberation Army is something which
is part and parcel of this movement. Colombia can
count on Senegal's support for achieving a lasting
and sustainable peace. The Colombian experience is
an excellent source of inspiration for the whole world
and for Africa in particular. Seen from Africa, what
is happening in Colombia follows saying I heard on
Colombian television: a people who does not know
their history is condemned to see it repeated. Colombia
knows its history.
