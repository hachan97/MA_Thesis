Mrs. Mele Colifa (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in Spanish): Iwould like to thank Mr. Jean-Pierre Lacroix,
Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations,
for his valuable briefing on his mandate. I would also
like to thank Lieutenant General Leonard Ngondi,
Force Commander of the African Union-United Nations
Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID); Maj or General
Jean-Paul Deconinck, Force Commander of the United
Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization
Mission in Mali; and Lieutenant General Frank Mushyo
Kamanzi of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan
(UNMISS) for briefing us on the situations of their
peacekeeping missions.

Equatorial Guinea expresses its gratitude for the
work being done in these difficult missions. They
represent the true essence of this Organization and the
operationalization of its ideals. We would like to pay
tribute to all those who risk their lives every day on
behalf of the Organization in various parts of the world
but, above all, on the African continent.

In the spirit of this meeting, we would like to put
forward the following questions.

With regard to UNAMID, for its success, what
challenges does the mission face in fulfilling its
mandate? What should the Security Council do to
ensure that mandates are fully implemented without
amending them?

Concerning the United Nations Multidimensional
Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African
Republic, what is lacking for the tasks to be carried out
correctly? In order to fully implement its mandate, what
needs to be improved both, on the ground and in terms
of the materials used and developed during operations?

With regard to UNMISS, what should be changed,
improved or abandoned in order to ensure that mandates
are correctly and properly implemented? On whom
does the success of a peacekeeping operation depend?
