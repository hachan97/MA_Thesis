Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): In voting today to adopt these two
resolutions, we are stating once again that the
international community must not slacken its efforts to
fight both Al-Qaida and the Taliban.

In supporting the policy of national reconciliation
in Afghanistan, we are guided by the clear adherence of
the Government and other parties to the conditions of
the sanctions regime. It is necessary to adhere to the
principle of the individual approach in the process of
de-listing. Efforts must be made to accelerate the
process oflisting and de-listing.

Concerning the efforts of the Security Council to
ensure greater transparency in the context of the
sanctions against Al-Qaida, we are convinced that
these must be carried out keeping in mind the real
nature of the serious and continuing threat posed by
Al-Qaida, in a spirit of seriousness and with continued
vigilance against that threat.

We are satisfied at the fact that the resolutions
contain provisions that maintain the control of the
Council over the process of de-listing with respect to
those members of Al-Qaida that have had a change of
heart.
