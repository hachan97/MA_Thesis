Mr. Almunayekh (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic):
Kuwait voted in favour of resolution 2468 (2019), which
extends the mandate of the United Nations Mission for
the Referendum in Western Sahara until 31 October.
We had hoped for a unanimous renewal by the Security
Council for one year. We stress the importance of the
role of the Mission and of ensuring that it can fully
implement its mandate. We renew our support for the
Head of the Mission and for the work of Mr. Kohler,
Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Western
Sahara, in implementing the relevant Security Council
resolutions and developing confidence-building
measures with a view to reaching a realistic, lasting,
practical and accepted political solution.

We reaffirm our support for continued negotiations,
backed by the United Nations. We welcome the
continued participation by all stakeholders in the round
tables, without preconditions and in good faith, with the
aim of maintaining the pace of the meetings, breaking
the deadlock and bringing views closer together. We
appreciate everyone's concern about the future of the
Arab Maghreb and about the economic and social gains
that promote security, stability and development in
the region.

The State of Kuwait reaffirms its support for
the Moroccan initiative for the autonomy of Western
Sahara and for reaching a constructive solution
acceptable to all the parties. We stress the sovereignty,
unity and territorial integrity of Morocco and welcome
the credible and serious steps and initiatives it has
taken, as well as the role played by the two committees
of the National Council of Human Rights in Dakhla
and Laayoune under the auspices of the United Nations
bodies concerned with human rights.
