The President (interpretation from French): I thank
the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bahrain for his kind
words addressed to me and my predecessor.

The next speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs
of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Mr. Ali-Akbar Velayati.
I welcome him and invite him to take a seat at the
Council table and to make his statement.
