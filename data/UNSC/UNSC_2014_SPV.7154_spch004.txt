Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation has called for this
emergency meeting of the Security Council because
of the serious dangerous evolution of the situation in
south-eastern Ukraine. We have pointed out on several
occasions, including in this Chamber, that the reckless
actions that led to the coup d'etat by the self-proclaimed
Kyiv authorities threaten to definitively destroy the
fragile mosaic of Ukrainian society. The authorities
do not wish to listen to those who do not accept the
imposed dominance of Kyiv by national radicals and
chauvinistic, Russophobic and anti-Semitic forces,
whom they perceive as a threat to their human dignity
and to their very lives.

Grotesque Russophobia and entrenched hatred have
become the norm in the Verkhovna Rada as well. A
few days ago, a member of Parliament belonging to the
chauvinist Svoboda party said this about the Russian-
speaking inhabitants of Ukraine:

"I would have acted much more harshly. I would
simply have shot them. The enemy is prevailing in
our land. They should have been chased out in 1654.
These creatures deserve only one thing - death."

It should be noted that this was said by a woman. We
can only imagine the thoughts that must be churning
in the minds of her brutal fellow partisans. And that
is not even the most radical group on the Ukrainian
political spectrum. Should we be surprised that the
peaceful political protects and the call by the people of
south-eastern Ukraine for their aspirations to be heard
have been met by the Rada with draconic laws entailing
long-term prison sentences for separatism?

The events of the past two days have shown that,
following our many calls for the organization of
inclusive national political dialogue, a measure of
common sense has prevailed in Kyiv. Prime Minister
Yatsenyuk went to Donetsk; although he did not meet
with the protesters, he did say the right things about
dialogue, decentralization and his desire to find a way
out of the problem.

What is the situation today? We have been told
that restraint will be exercised and a peaceful solution
found to the situation that takes into account the
opinions of the various groupings of the Ukrainian
population. That has been confirmed by our Western
interlocutors. However, on 13 April the Verkhovna
Rada-appointed President Turchynov stated that the
Ukrainian Security Council had decided to launch a
full-scale anti-terrorist operation, including the use
of the armed forces. However, unlike the Maidan
demonstrators, the protesters have terrorized no one,
have used no bulldozers against the authorioties, and
thrown no Molotov cocktails. It is no coincidence
that law-enforcement officers were present among the
Maidan protestors.

Now the Kyiv authorities must use force to suppress
other areas of the country. According to Turchynov, the
people of south-eastern Ukraine must end their protests
by the morning of Monday, 14 April, lest armed force
be used. However, the protesters' interests and opinions
have not been taken into account or even discussed. As
a result, blood has already been shed in the South-East
and the situation is extremely dangerous. Any further
escalation of the situation must be swiftly stopped.

The international community must require the
Maidan henchmen who seized power in Kyiv to cease
their war against their own people and to implement all
the commitments under the 21 February agreement. The
Western sponsors of the Maidan henchmen, in particular
those who stood as witnesses to the agreement and the
United States, which is their backer, are obligated to
end their support, dissociate themselves from neo-
Nazis and other extremists, stop the use of force against
the Ukrainian people, and begin forthwith a genuine
national dialogue with the full participation of all
regions, in the interests of the speedy implementation
of radical constitutional reform.

It is the West that must determine the opportunity
for avoiding civil war in Ukraine. Some people,
including in this Chamber, do not wish to recognize the
real reasons for the events in Ukraine and are forever
seeing the hand of Moscow in the South-East. Enough is
enough. They must stop claiming that we have deployed
our army along the border with that country and are
practically already at the English Channel, and that we
have sent agents to coordinate the protests in Ukraine.
It must be understood that south-eastern Ukraine and
its people are deeply worried about their future and
that they do not want anyone, especially the nationalist
radicals, to impose their will on them.
