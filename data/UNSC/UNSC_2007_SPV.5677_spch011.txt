Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We are grateful to Mr. Holmes, Under-
Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, for the
work he has been doing and for his substantive briefing
today.

We share his concern about the serious
humanitarian situation in Somalia. Events of recent
months have increased the number of refugees and
internally displaced persons. We call on the authorities
in Somalia and all Somali parties to do their utmost to
eliminate barriers to the provision of humanitarian
assistance and to cooperate in the work of
humanitarian organizations.

It is clear that the causes of the current
humanitarian crisis in Somalia lie above all in the lack
of a political settlement. Russia has consistently
advocated the establishment of a Government and
peace in Somalia in the interests of the people of that
country and of security and stability in the Horn of
Africa. We believe that the consequences of the crisis
in Somalia can be overcome only through a broad-
based dialogue. An important role in that process is to
be played by the national reconciliation congress called
for by President Yusuf.

We highly commend the efforts of the African
Union, the League of Arab States, the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development and
other interested parties to cooperate in the
establishment of peace, stability and reconciliation in
Somalia. We support the timely deployment there of an
African Union peacekeeping force. We express our
condolences to the Government of Uganda on the
deaths of Ugandan peacekeepers in Somalia.

In the light of the ceasefire agreement between
the Government of Uganda and the Lord's Resistance
Army, it is our hope that the final phase in resolving
the problem in northern Uganda has begun. We feel
that the resolution of that conflict will also help to
strengthen stability in the region of Africa where the
borders of Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the
Congo and the Sudan meet.
