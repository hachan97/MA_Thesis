Mr. King (United Kingdom): We are grateful for
today's briefing.

The United Kingdom fully associates itself with
the statement that will be made later by the
representative of Greece on behalf of the European
Union and its acceding and associated countries.

If I may, I just want to take this opportunity to
take up three points in particular. First, in the context
of the agreed "standards before status" policy, I would
just like to underline that the United Kingdom fully
supports the efforts to make the benchmarks
operational. We are grateful for the comments and
practical suggestions that have been made today
regarding taking that important work forward,
especially those made by the representatives of the
Secretariat and the United States. As others have
already said, we need to maintain our efforts in that
regard.

Secondly, Mr. Annabi raised the question of
tackling parallel structures. I would be grateful for
anything more that he might want to add on where we
stand, in particular on UNMIK's progress in that regard
in Mitrovica.

Thirdly, as our Fifth Committee colleagues
recently discussed, UNMIK will see a reduction in staff
numbers in the period ahead. We would welcome
anything more that Mr. Annabi could say about how, in
practice, UNMIK will proceed in shifting its activities
from an executive role to a monitoring advisory role.
