Mr. Teixeira da Silva (France) (interpretation from French): The Security Council, in resolution 955 (1994),
entrusted the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda
with the mission of prosecuting, trying and punishing the
persons responsible for acts of genocide committed in 1994
in Rwanda. No one can underestimate the importance of
this task, nor its difficulty. The judges of the Tribunal are
discharging their work in a manner that deserves our
particular tribute.

The President of the Tribunal requested in August
1997 an increase in the number of judges, to make it
possible to establish a third Chamber and to complete the
trials in a reasonable time-frame. France supported that
request the moment it was presented to the Council. This
increase in the number of judges, foreseen by the Council
when it adopted resolution 955 (1994), was, in fact, made
necessary by the growing number of cases before the
Tribunal.
The French delegation is pleased that the members of
the Council are unanimous in their positive response to the
request of the Tribunal President. We will vote in favour of
the draft resolution, of which we are a sponsor. We pay
tribute to the Swedish delegation for its initiative in
preparing the draft resolution.

The adoption of this draft resolution will attest to the
Council's determination to endow the Tribunal with the
means necessary for it to continue its work for justice.
Furthermore, we have every confidence that the Tribunal
will pursue the efforts it has already made to improve its
functioning and procedures.

The French delegation hopes that the Security Council
can also respond positively to the similar request made by
the President of the International Criminal Tribunal for the
Former Yugoslavia for an increase in the number of that
Tribunal's judges.
