Mr. Cunningham (United States of America):
Mr. President, let me join others in congratulating you
and welcoming you to the chair at the head of this
table. I also want to thank Mr. Annabi for his update.

We support the intent of the Secretary-General
and the efforts of Special Representative Klein to finish
implementation of the mandate of the United Nations
Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH) by the
end of 2002 and to transfer it to a regional
organization. We hope that this process can serve as a
model in some way for future such situations.

The Peace Implementation Council Steering
Board, which is meeting today and tomorrow in
Brussels, will consider how to streamline the
international civilian presence. Special Representative
Klein is participating in that discussion, and we hope
that this will ensure close coordination and help
produce the seamless transition that I am sure we all
want. We expect that the conclusions of the Brussels
discussion will play a key role in shaping the end-
phase transition.

As this process goes ahead, the State Border
Service is an area of special concern to us. The State
Border Service needs more political support and more
resources. The Secretary-General's report is clear that
there are positive results from the Border Service in
reducing illegal immigration and smuggling, and the
Border Service will also have a role in ensuring
effective efforts against terrorism.

We strongly support the Secretary-General's call
for more resources and the UNMIBH initiative for a
donors' conference later this month. The State Border
Service has a key and central role in Bosnia's future,
and its short-term and long-term financial needs
require urgent attention from the international
community.
