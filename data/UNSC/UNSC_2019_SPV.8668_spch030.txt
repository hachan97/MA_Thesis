The President: May I add my own voice to
that of my Minister in asking speakers to limit their
statements to four minutes. If we do not adhere to the
time limits, some colleagues will not be able to speak
in today's debate. It is to help and guide the discussion
that I say that the presidency sees no need to thank us
for organizing the debate, or for any remarks on our
wisdom and sagacity in choosing the theme. When the
time has reached four minutes, a light will begin to
flash, following which my very friendly colleague will
come with a note asking the speaker to wind up.

I now give the floor to the representative
of Switzerland.
