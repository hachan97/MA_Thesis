Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I am not certain how the representative of
Ukraine wishes to engage in dialogue with us, but we
believe that negotiations should address the broader
agenda of our relations. They cannot be dictated by
Kyiv on one, two, three or four specific points; they
should be based on a broad agenda concerning our
relations. I believe that there are good prospects for
interraction between our two countries, so we should
seek to develop them constructively and to find a way
out of this difficult juncture in our relations and in the
history of Ukraine as soon as possible.

Russia did not cause the events in Ukraine, but
we remain ready to help Ukraine find a solution if it
can make the appropriate decisions. A very interesting
and positive opportunity is available to Ukraine now
that it has elected a President, who will shortly assume
his mandate. He must take the right decisions, rather
than measures that would only perpetuate the current
stalemate.
