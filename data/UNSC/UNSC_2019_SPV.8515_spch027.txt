Mr. Yao Shaojun (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
was hoping that Ambassador Pierce would still be here
so that she would have the opportunity to listen to my
response. Instead, after acting like ajudge and firing a
few questions at us, she simply left.

Ms. Pierce raised a question that Mr. Cohen also
touched on. As far as China is concerned, politically
speaking, we fully support the cross-border delivery
of humanitarian assistance. As for questions that are
discussed in the Fifth Committee, since budgetary and
financial issues are involved, they should be left to our
colleagues in the Fifth Committee rather than to us
on the Security Council. I nevertheless checked with
my colleague on the Fifth Committee. I was told that
consensus had already been reached on the issue in the
Fifth Committee. Accordingly, there was no issue as to
whether China supported the cross-border delivery of
humanitarian assistance or had attempted to obstruct it.
There was no such issue. The issue has been resolved,
so there is no problem. There was no need to bring it up
in the Security Council.
