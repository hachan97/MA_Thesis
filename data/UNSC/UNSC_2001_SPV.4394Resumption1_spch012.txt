The President: Council members will recall my
undertaking at the beginning of Ireland's presidency to
explore the possibility of bringing to a conclusion the
matter of the report of the Working Group on the
general issues of sanctions. As Council members are
aware, the Chairman's proposed outcome was
circulated among Council members in February this
year, but it has not yet been possible to agree on a final
text.

I consider it important to achieve agreement on
this text. A very small number of differences still
remain. While they relate to issues of some sensitivity,
they are in my judgement by no means insurmountable.
Over the past two weeks we have met with all the
concerned parties on a number of occasions in order to
obtain a clearer understanding of the outstanding points
of contention and thereby to attempt to identify
possible means of overcoming these few remaining
obstacles. Those discussions are still ongoing. I would
hope to report back soon to Council members on
further developments.

The Council has thus concluded the present stage
ofits consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 11.50 am.
