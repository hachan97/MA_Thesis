The President: From the viewpoint of the
presidency, I would say to the representative of Costa
Rica that we share totally that last sentiment: that rule
of law applies to everybody, and that all organs and
agencies of the United Nations have an interest in it. It
is not the exclusive purview of the Security Council -
not by any means. This debate reflects the interest of
the Security Council in the subject. But so does
everyone else have an interest.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Japan.
