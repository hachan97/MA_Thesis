The President: I thank Mr. Grandi for his briefing.

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements.

I again encourage members to take the opportunity,
now that the High Commissioner is here for the first
time since the end of 2017, to ask questions on this issue
and have him respond in a more interactive session.

The first speaker is the representative of Equatorial
Guinea. As he is speaking on behalf of the group
that comprises the African members of the Security
Council, I think members will all agree that he deserves
two turns of the hourglass.
