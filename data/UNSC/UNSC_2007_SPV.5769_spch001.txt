The President: The Security Council will now
proceed to the consideration of its annual report to the
General Assembly, for the period from I August 2006
to 31 July 2007.

Members of the Council have before them the
draft report as circulated by the Assistant Secretary-
General for Political Affairs on 4 October 2007, and a
corrigendum thereto.

The introduction to the draft report was prepared
by the delegation of China with the participation of
other members of the Council, and the body of the
report was prepared by the Secretariat. I should like to
express appreciation to China and the Secretariat for
their respective contributions.

I should also like to point out that the format of
the draft report now before the Council corresponds to
the provisions initially set out in the note by the
President of 22 May 2002 (S/2002/199) and now
incorporated in the note by the President of 19 July
2006 (S/2006/507).

The floor is open for those members who wish to
speak.
