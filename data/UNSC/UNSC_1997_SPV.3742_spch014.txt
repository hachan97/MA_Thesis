Mr. Cabral (Guinea-Bissau) (interpretation from French): Many of this world's political leaders have
fashioned international relations on the basis of their
political stature, but few among them have a national
destiny that can be likened to that of the deceased leader
whose memory we are recalling today.

The national destiny of this deceased leader has
transcended the borders of his country, affecting the course
of events and assuredly the course of contemporary
international relations. I wish, on behalf of my country, to
convey to the Chinese delegation our sincerest condolences,
and I should like to ask the representative of China to
express to the family of the deceased our profoundest
sorrow.
