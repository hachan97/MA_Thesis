The President (spoke in Spanish): Before I
adjourn this meeting, which we all hope will be the last
of the year, I should like once again to thank all my
colleagues from each and every delegation, and, most
especially, to express our gratitude to the entire
Secretariat team for the support they have provided
over the last two years and, in particular, during the
past month. Likewise, I would express our appreciation
to all the interpreters, who, I am sure, have been put to
the test by those of us who have, perhaps, given them
somewhat more work in this important task.
Finally, let me wish everyone very happy
holidays and my very best wishes for the year 2003.

There are no further speakers on my list.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 12.20 p.m.
