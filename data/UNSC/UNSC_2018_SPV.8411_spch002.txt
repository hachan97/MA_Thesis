Ms. Ghelani: I provide this update today on behalfof
the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs
and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mr. Mark Lowcock.

I would like to start with the situation in north-
western Syria, where there have been reports of
mortars - including some shells reportedly containing
chlorine gas - hitting three densely populated
neighbourhoods in western Aleppo city: Nile Street,
Al-Khalidiyah and Al-Zahraa. People with respiratory
symptoms were rushed to the two main hospitals
in the area. The World Health Organization has
provided support to both hospitals and stands ready
to provide further public health support, as required.
As the Secretary-General has repeatedly stressed, any
confirmed use of chemical weapons is abhorrent and a
clear violation of international law.

We have also received reports of air strikes in
Idlib governorate on 24 and 25 November - the first
such air strikes in more than two months. Those latest
developments demonstrate the fragility of the situation
and the urgent need for the sustained engagement of all
sides to preserve the gains of the agreement that was
reached between the Republic of Turkey and the Russian
Federation on 17 September. The stakes remain high, as
the alternative is humanitarian suffering on a scale that
would devastate a population of some 3 million people
in north-western Syria, who have known nothing but
war and suffering in recent years.

In Rukban, between 3 and 8 November, the
United Nations, together with the Syrian Arab Red
Crescent, was finally able to reach some 50,000
people - three-quarters of them women and children.
That aid operation, approved by the Government of
Syria and facilitated by the Russian Federation and the
United States, was the first major delivery of material
assistance to the people of Rukban since January, and
the first time that aid has been delivered from within
Syria. Our teams also vaccinated more than 5,000
children, together with officials from the Syrian
Ministry of Health.

Colleagues returned shocked by what they had
seen on the ground, reporting grave protection issues,
increasing food insecurity and no certified medical
doctors among the stranded population. Given the
gravity of the situation, the Secretary-General has
called for the deployment of a further convoy to the
area as a matter of priority. Without sustained access,
the situation of tens of thousands of Syrians, stranded
in the harshest desert conditions, will only further
deteriorate as the winter cold sets in.

Most people inside the makeshift settlement have
stated a desire to return to their homes, but many
are terrified of what the future may hold for them,
whether it is in Government areas or locations held
by non-State armed groups. A durable solution that is
safe, voluntary and dignified - one that adequately
addresses protection concerns - is urgently needed for
the population in Rukban.

We are seriously concerned about the increasing
number of reports of civilian casualties due to air
strikes and ground fighting in south-eastern Deir
ez-Zor governorate. Many civilians are reported among
the dead and injured. Some 6,000 have been displaced
from the Hajin enclave, controlled by the Islamic State
in Iraq and the Levant, since October, with an estimated
10,000 people remaining within the enclave. Most are
unable to access assistance and face severe protection
risks. Of those who have been displaced, many live in

dire conditions in makeshift settlements, with some
dangerously close to the front lines.
Despite considerable challenges in accessing areas
of displacement due to insecurity and geographic
isolation, local United Nations humanitarian partners
have continued to provide assistance to internally
displaced persons (IDPs) in the Gharanij and Bahrah
areas. That includes multisectoral assistance provided
to 6,000 IDPs. We reiterate that under international law,
the parties to the conflict must protect civilians against
attacks, treat them humanely and allow and facilitate
the delivery of humanitarian relief.

We are also deeply troubled by reports of restrictions
in north-eastern Syria, where half of the some 100,000
children enrolled in Government-run schools are facing
impediments to accessing their schools, especially in
Qamishli and Al-Hasakah cities. An estimated 10,000
children have not been able to attend school at all
since late September. Vehicles, including school buses
and private cars, have been prevented from crossing
checkpoints if they are carrying children going to
schools that teach the nationally accredited curriculum.

Over the past weeks, the United Nations has
been engaged in efforts with all concerned parties to
advocate for children to be able to go safely to a school
of their choosing. Across Syria, the conflict continues
to have a devastating impact on children, including their
access to education. An estimated 180,000 teachers are
no longer in service. Some 40 per cent of schools have
been damaged or destroyed, and many others have been
used to shelter displaced people. All Syrian children
have a right to education Without discrimination, and
that right must be protected, respected and fulfilled.

Despite the very difficult conditions, the United
Nations and its partners are committed to reaching all
those in need, wherever they are. Over the past year, an
average of almost 5.4 million people have been reached
with humanitarian assistance each month through all
possible avenues - from within Syria to areas under
Government control, from within Syria across conflict
lines, and from across the borders.

Cross-border aid remains a critical part of the
United Nations response in Syria. This month alone,
nearly 600,000 people in Syria have received United
Nations food assistance delivered across the border
with Turkey through the crossings at Bab Al-Salam
and Bab Al-Hawa. Cross-border deliveries also
included medicines, educational supplies and other
non-food items for hundreds of thousands of people.
Humanitarian organizations have just completed
the vaccination of more than 12,500 children, aged
between six months and 15 years, against measles and
rubella in Idlib governorate, using supplies that had
been delivered across the border. Thousands more
benefited from education supplies and services, school
rehabilitation and textbooks.

United Nations cross-border assistance is checked
and verified by the United Nations Monitoring
Mechanism for the Syrian Arab Republic at designated
border-crossing points. Every truck is checked to ensure
that it contains only humanitarian supplies. Deliveries
are confirmed by United Nations-contracted third-
party monitors upon arrival at warehouses inside Syria,
where they check the items being offloaded against
the waybill. Then there is post-distribution monitoring
again, including by independent third parties and
through feedback received from affected communities.
United Nations cross-border assistance is also subject
to the normal accountability mechanisms between the
donors and the delivery agencies, which also includes
another verification system.

Currently, some 4.3 million people in need live
in areas outside the control of the Government. That
accounts for more than one-third of all people in need of
assistance in Syria. It includes almost 3 million people
in need in areas reached exclusively through cross-
border operations. The United Nations does not have an
alternative means of reaching those people, as access
from within the country is impeded. It is for that reason
that the Secretary-General has called for a renewal of
resolution 2165 (2014) for an additional 12 months. The
renewal of the resolution will continue to save lives.
Millions ofpeople depend on the Council's decision.
