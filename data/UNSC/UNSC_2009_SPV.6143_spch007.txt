Mr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): Viet Nam
consistently supports resolving conflicts and disputes
by means of peaceful negotiations, in accordance with
international law. As we desire a realistic solution
based upon consideration of the legitimate interests of
all of the parties concerned, the draft technical
extension resolution, as contained in document
S/2009/310, did not have the support of even the most
concerned parties within the Group of Friends, and
therefore did not have the consensus of the Council.

In that circumstance, Viet Nam abstained in order
to leave options open for negotiations. I would like to
reaffirm Viet Nam's support for the mission's
continued operation under a mandate that reflects the
new realities. We look forward to participating in and
contributing to the process of negotiations, on terms set
forth in a revised mandate.
