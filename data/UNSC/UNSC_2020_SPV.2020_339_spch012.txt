We thank Special Representative of the Secretary-General Tanin for his valuable updates, for the continued cooperation with the Security Council and for presenting the comprehensive report of the Secretary-General (S/2020/255) on the activities of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). We welcome all representatives to this virtual meeting. We begin by acknowledging all efforts aimed at responding to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which continues to have far-reaching consequences for international peace and security. This response must be collaborative, and in that regard we encourage all States and multilateral bodies and agencies to engage constructively with each other. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines emphasizes the need for the good-faith commitment of both parties to a peaceful political solution. In that regard, we urge the parties to utilize the tools of diplomacy, including dialogue, mediation, political negotiations and other peaceful means. We take this opportunity to condemn the incidents targeting religious sites and cemeteries, as mentioned in the Secretary-General's report. Such actions prevent the creation and maintenance of an environment conducive to stability and progress. We underscore the significance of women's participation in the peace process and commend UNMIK's work in helping advance women's political participation. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines commends UNMIK's efforts in promoting security and stability in Kosovo and welcomes all initiatives to that end, which include engagement with young people and the implementation of the recommendations of the 2018 United Nations Kosovo Trust-Building Forum. We also acknowledge UNMIK's close cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and domestic bodies as it discharges its mandate. As we conclude, we note with concern the challenging political situation in Kosovo and hope for a peaceful and workable solution.
