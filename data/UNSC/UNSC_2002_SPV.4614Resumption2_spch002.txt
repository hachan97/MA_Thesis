Mr. Cunningham (United States of America):
The resolution that we have adopted this evening was
flawed, in our view, in that it failed to explicitly
condemn the terrorist groups and those who provide
them with political cover, support and safe haven in the
perpetuation of conflict in the Middle East. Those
responsible for killing civilians obstruct the Quartet's
efforts and the prospects for Palestinian reform. They
are known groups - Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad,
and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade. The leaders and
spokesmen of these groups have openly claimed credit
for scores of terrorist bombings and for many deaths
and injuries. Their actions are aimed at the peace
process, at Israelis and at Palestinians.

This Council cannot claim to be seriously
considering efforts in the Middle East unless it is also
willing to recognize the tragic dynamic at play. Each
time a glimmer of hope, however dim, appears, a
terrorist act rises up to extinguish it. What we had
hoped for at this time was for the Council to assume its
responsibilities, take a clear stand against the actions of
these terrorist groups and call for action against them.

This resolution starts that process, but it does not
go far enough. Nor does it provide the clarity and
context we think is required, as set out in the draft text
we ourselves tabled on Monday. Our text was more
explicit on terrorism, those who perpetuate it, the need
to combat it, and on strong support for the Quartet, the
political process and continued effort on the ground in
the region. Because this resolution does not meet that
standard, and because we do not think it as well
conceived or worded as it should be, given the
importance of the issues it addresses, we have
abstained.
