Mr. Ward (Jamaica): My delegation joins
colleagues in thanking Mr. Bernard Miyet for updating
us on the latest developments in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. We recognize the important work being
carried out by the United Nations Mission in Bosnia
and Herzegovina (UNMIBH) in establishing
mechanisms for the rule of law and in implementing
the peace process. We note in particular the efforts of
UNMIBH in the area of police reform and
restructuring. Of equal importance is the assessment
and restructuring of the judicial system. Effective local
police and judicial institutions are critical elements in
efforts at creating self-sustaining peace. It is therefore
important that judicial reform continue to be a priority.

We are encouraged by the briefing we received
today. While we recognize that there are still many
challenges, we believe that these incremental steps
forward demonstrate that progress is possible even
under very difficult circumstances. The acceptance of
accountability and responsibility by local leaders is
crucial to the process, and the ultimate success of
UNMIBH's work will depend on the continued
cooperation ofthe people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

During the past few weeks we have had
encouraging reports of increasing numbers of refugee
returns. We are concerned, however, about reports that
local authorities have been slow to act on the illegal
occupancy of homes of returnees. It has been reported
that illegal occupancy is the biggest single barrier to
returns. My delegation would like to hear from Mr.
Miyet about what steps, if any, are being taken or are
contemplated to correct this situation.
