Mrs. Haley (United States of America): I would
like to read out the first part of rule 32 of the provisional
rules of procedure of the Security Council, which says
"Principal motions and draft resolutions shall have
precedence in the order of their submission."

My Russian friends have chosen once again to say
that they go according to procedure, except when it
applies to something they do not like. What we have
to do is go according to procedure. Rule 32 spells out
exactly how that order should be. We do not need the
Russians coming in and saying "We do not like the
answer to this, so we want you to change it". I think that
the Council should be disciplined, abide by rule 32 of
the provisional rules of procedure and take the politics
out of the situation.
