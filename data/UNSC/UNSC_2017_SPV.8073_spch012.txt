Mr. Bessho (Japan): Several cases of alleged use
of chemical weapons in Syria remain unresolved and
the work of the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM)
is clearly not over. The continued role of the JIM. is
essential to ensuring accountability. Japan supported
draft resolution S/2017/884, submitted by the United
States, because we believe that it makes sense to ensure
the continuity of the work of the JIM. through the
extension of its current mandate.

I listened very carefully to statements made by the
representatives of Russia and Bolivia. It is unfortunate
that the Mechanism's mandate was not renewed
today. At the same time, I understand that Russia and
Bolivia do not oppose the renewal of the mandate as
such. Japan has full confidence in the Mechanism's
expertise, impartiality and professionalism. It is the
responsibility of the international community and
indeed of all humanity to ensure accountability for the
use of chemical weapons. It is therefore important that
the Security Council decide to extend the mandate of
the Joint Investigative Mechanism.
