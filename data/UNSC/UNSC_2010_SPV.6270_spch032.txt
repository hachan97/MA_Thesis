The President (spoke in French): I thank
Mr. Witting for his statement.

After the statement of Mr. Serrano, we shall
suspend the meeting for lunch - the Council does
understand that a French president requires a hearty
lunch - and will resume the meeting at 3 p.m.

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Tete
Antonio, Permanent Observer of the African Union to
the United Nations.
