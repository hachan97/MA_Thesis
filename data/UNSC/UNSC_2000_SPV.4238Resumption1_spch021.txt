The President: We are grateful for that very
comprehensive statement.

Speakers have been thanking me for putting this
item on the agenda. I must say that I have to share all
these thanks with Jamaica and Bangladesh, of course.

One of the many things that you called for,
Mrs. Pereira, was that the international financial
institutions show determination. I would like to hear to
what extent the World Bank is ready to face that
challenge and whatever other comments you,
Mr. Madavo, would like to make in response to what
you have heard today. I give you the floor.
