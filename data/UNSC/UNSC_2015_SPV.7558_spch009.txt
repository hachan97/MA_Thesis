The President: I thank Mr. Hinds for his briefing,
and I thank all four briefers for, among them, raising
so clearly some of the important issues facing police
contingents, as part of United Nations peacekeeping
operations, in seeking to implement mandates for the
protection of civilians.

I now give the floor to the members of the Security
Council and encourage them in particular to respond to
what they have just heard from our four briefers and to
put their own questions to the briefers.
