The President: I wish to warmly welcome the
Secretary-General and ministers and other high-level
representatives of the Security Council members
participating in today's meeting. Their presence is an
affirmation of the importance of the subject matter to
be addressed today.

Under rule 37 of the Council's provisional
rules of procedure, I invite the representatives of
Afghanistan, Armenia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Botswana,
Canada, Colombia, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba, Egypt, India,
Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Israel, Japan,
Kazakhstan, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, New Zealand,
Nigeria, Norway, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, South
Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, the Syrian Arab
Republic, Tunisia, Turkey, Uganda and the Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela to participate in this meeting.

Under rule 39 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure, I invite His Excellency Mr. Thomas Mayr-
Harting, Head of the Delegation of the European Union
to the United Nations, to participate in this meeting.

The Council will now begin its consideration ofthe
item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members to
document S/2013/3, which contains the text of a letter
dated 1 January 2013 from the Permanent Representative
of Pakistan to the United Nations addressed to the
Secretary-General, transmitting a concept paper on the
item under consideration.

I hope that this open debate will serve to promote
a holistic View of the continuing threats and challenges
posed by international terrorism and of the best ways
to address that menace collectively through a coherent
and comprehensive approach. It is an issue of common
concern to the international community at large. It is
through solidarity, understanding, cooperation and
collective action that we can respond more effectively to
the threat. That objective, I am sure, will be reinforced
by our discussion today.

I now give the floor to the Secretary-General, His
Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon.
