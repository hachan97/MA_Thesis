The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of the Central African Republic and
Chad, in which they request to be invited to participate
in the consideration of the item on the Council's
agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite
those representatives to participate in the consideration
of the item, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Ponkre-Kono
(Central African Republic) and Mr. Allam-rni
(Chad) took seats at the Council table.

The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Victor Da Silva
Angelo, Special Representative and head of the United
Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and
Chad.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Angelo to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2009/359, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the United Nations Mission in
the Central African Republic and Chad.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a

give the floor.
