We would like to thank the Chair of the Committee pursuant to resolution 751 (1992), concerning Somalia, for his report and for his work on the Committee over the past two years. I would like to join colleagues and profoundly thank Belgium for its dedicated leadership as Chair of this important committee. Our gratitude goes to Philippe Kridelka, as well as to his predecessor, Marc Pecsteen de Buytswerve. What they have achieved in the past two years on substance is very important. I also want to highlight the fact that they achieved the strengthening of the working relationship between the Panel of Experts and the Federal Government of Somalia. We recall that that was not always the case. I therefore thank them for achieving that. The independent work and quality reporting of the Panel of Experts continues to be of great importance to the work of the Committee. That is why the work of the Panel enjoys our full support. I can only add my voice to those who have highlighted the continuous challenge that Al-Shabaab poses to the stability and security of the country. Therefore, for us, it is very important that the sanctions regime be continued in order to really prevent Al-Shabaab from what it is trying to do.
