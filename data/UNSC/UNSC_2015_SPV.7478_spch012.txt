Mrs. Kawar (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): At the
outset, I would like to thank Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda
of the International Criminal Court for her briefing this
afternoon. I would also like to thank the Prosecutor
for presenting her twenty-first report to the Security
Council pursuant to resolution 1593 (2005).
We take note of the briefing by the International
CriminalCourt's Prosecutorandreiteratetheimportance
of the principles that underlie the establishment of
the Court. Those principles are extremely important
to the pursuit of international justice and to holding
accountable those who are responsible for international
crimes and war crimes. Moreover, the Court plays an
essential role in putting an end to impunity, with a view
to preventing conflict or its reoccurrence. The Court
also promotes key principles in that regard, including
peaceful coexistence, the maintenance of international
peace and security, and the promotion of the rule oflaw.

Jordan is concerned about the deteriorating
humanitarian situation in Darfur, as mentioned in the
report, including violations of human rights law and
international humanitarian law, and the persistent
attacks on civilians and the staff of humanitarian
organizations, as well as United Nations Blue Helmets.
Jordan reiterates the importance of cooperation
with the International Criminal Court, to ensure
the implementation of the Court's mandate and the
Council's resolutions.

As a matter of utmost importance, it must be
underscored that the situation in Darfur cannot be
resolved in the absence of a sustainable development
agenda that will respond to the fundamental needs
of the local communities and assist them in meeting
their socioeconomic challenges, as well as a road map
leading to the return of those that have been displaced.

To conclude, justice and development in Darfur
are essential and must be achieved first in order to
establish a lasting peace, which can be done only with
the involvement of all stakeholders.
