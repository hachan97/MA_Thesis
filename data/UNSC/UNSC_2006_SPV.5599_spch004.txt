Mrs. Papadopoulou (Greece): Greece co-
sponsored the present resolution because we believe
that it is a positive first step in addressing concerns
regarding the need to establish procedural fairness
within the current system of delisting procedures. In
our View, by allowing individuals and entities listed to
have direct access to the committees' delisting
procedures, the resolution enhances the effectiveness
and credibility of the relevant sanctions regime.

We believe, however, that the sanctions
committees should continue to improve their delisting
procedures, particularly in the direction of establishing
a review mechanism along the lines of the useful
suggestions made recently by such member States as
Denmark, and other relevant processes. The
improvement of targeted sanctions regimes is
important if sanctions are to be a credible tool in the
hands of the Security Council.
