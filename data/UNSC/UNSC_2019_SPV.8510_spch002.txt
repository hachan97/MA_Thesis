Mr. Cohen (United States of America): We were
pleased to vote in favour of resolution 2466 (2019),
on the final renewal of the United Nations Mission
for Justice Support in Haiti (MINUJUSTH) until
15 October 2019. This resolution will conclude the
United Nations peacekeeping presence in Haiti after
more than 15 years.

On this occasion, we would like thank the
peacekeepers who have honourably served in
MINUJUSTH, and in the United Nations Stabilization
Mission in Haiti before it. We remember and honour
their sacrifices and efforts in support of a free,
prosperous and peaceful Haiti.

The resolution sets the stage for the transition to
a non-peacekeeping United Nations presence. We are
eager to establish a special political mission and look
forward to the report of the Secretariat that is tasked
in the resolution, which will facilitate the Security
Council's consideration of a mandate. In the interim,
we expect the Government of Haiti and MINUJUSTH
to continue working together to achieve the benchmarks
that the Council previously laid out until the drawdown
of the Mission and beyond.

The transition will mean a significant handover
of responsibility back into the hands of the Haitian
Government and its people. Now is the time for the
Government of Haiti to step up and assume that
responsibility. As a long-time partner and friend, the
United States continues to support Haiti on that path,
mindful of the challenges ahead.

In the immediate future, we call on all Haitian
actors to continue efforts towards a constructive and
inclusive dialogue that aims to find lasting solutions
to the current political and economic challenges. We
are convinced that genuine dialogue and compromise,
leading to a transparent and accountable Government,
can best serve the needs and aspirations of the
Haitian people.
