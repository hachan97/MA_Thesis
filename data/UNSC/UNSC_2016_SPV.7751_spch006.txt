Mr. Rosselli (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): My
delegation should like once again to call the Security
Council's attention to the procedures and time frames
in which draft resolutions are circulated to the Council
for its consideration. Resolution 2302 (2016), of which
my delegation voted in favour, was circulated by the
penholder for the first time on the evening of Wednesday
27 July, less than 48 hours ago, and issued in blue
yesterday afternoon, fewer than 24 hours later, with no
silence procedure and without taking the comments of
several members of the Council into account.

Just a few hours ago, a new version was circulated
in blue, in which the date of the mandate expiration
had been changed from Monday 8 August to Friday to
12 August. It was our understanding that the proposal
for a technical extension until 12 August, with the
intention of allowing further time for negotiating a
new draft resolution, implies a potentially significant
change in the mandate of the United Nations Mission

in South Sudan.

We believe that the draft text was considered
only by a small and highly select number of Security
members. It would be a mistake if we were to follow
such a procedure in the future. We have noted in prior
discussions that this procedure puts us in the difficult
position of having either to accept, abstain on or vote
against a fait accompli. We do not want to be faced
with those three options in any future recurrence of
this situation.

The meeting rose at 5.20 pm.
