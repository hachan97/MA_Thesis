The President: I invite the representative of
Albania to resume the seat reserved for him at the side
of the Council chamber.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list.

I will therefore take this opportunity, in my
national capacity, to express my deep satisfaction with
the work of Bulgaria over the past two years on the
Security Council.

The Security Council has a unique role in
maintaining peace and stability in the world. In 10 or
15 years, when Bulgaria will again have the chance to
preside over the Security Council, I believe the world
will be a better place. And who knows? Perhaps by that
time Bulgaria will be a permanent member of the
Security Council, I do not know. We will keep abreast
of progress in the reform of the United Nations.

Now, on behalf of the Bulgarian Government and delegations and to all nations of the world. God bless
the Bulgarian people, I would like to extend my wishes you.

for a happy holiday season and a happy New Year to all The meeting rose at [240 pmÂ»
