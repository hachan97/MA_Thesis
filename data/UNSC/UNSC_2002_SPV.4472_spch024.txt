The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank both
Mr. Oshima and Mr. De Mul for their observations and
responses.

I shall now give the floor to the Vice-Minister for
External Relations of Angola, Mr. Georges Chikoti, so
that he may conclude his observations and respond to
the comments and questions raised.
