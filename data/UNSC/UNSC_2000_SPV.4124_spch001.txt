The President: At the outset of the meeting, I should
like, on behalf of the Council, to express grief and sorrow
at the passing of His Excellency Mr. Habib Bourguiba,
leader and former President of the Republic of Tunisia. As
the father of Tunisia and as one of the architects of the
Organization of African Unity, President Bourguiba was
deeply committed to the cause of peace, and was an
embodiment of the hopes and aspirations of generations of
men and women in Tunisia and throughout Africa.

On behalf of the Council, I should like to request the
representative of Tunisia to convey to the bereaved family
and to the Government and the people of Tunisia our
profound condolences.
