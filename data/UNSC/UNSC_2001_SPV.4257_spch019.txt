The President: Let me make a procedural
announcement. We intend to suspend the morning
session of this meeting at around 1 p.m. We hope that
this will give sufficient time to Council members to
reflect on the views expressed by the troop-
contributing countries before they respond at 3 p.m.
today. As I announced at the outset of today's meeting,
after the Council members have spoken we will hear
the views of other Member States that are inscribed to
speak.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Argentina. I invite him to take a seat
at the Council table and to make his statement.
