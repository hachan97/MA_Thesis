Mr. De La Sabliere (France) (spoke in French): I
would like to thank you, Mr. President, for having
referred to our forthcoming trip to Central Africa. We
leave on Sunday for Kigali, Kinshasa, Bukavu,
Bujumbura and Entebbe, energized and eager to
continue the course that you have set in organizing
these very successful meetings here in Nairobi and to
follow up the good work the Security Council has done
this week to promote peace and security on the African
continent.
