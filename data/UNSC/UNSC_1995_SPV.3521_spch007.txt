Mr. Merimee (France) (interpretation from French):
First of all, I should like to thank the delegations that have
been so kind as to express their condolences - which I
shall not fail to convey - to my Government and to the
families.

The Council last week adopted a statement
condemning, in the strongest possible terms, the deliberate
attacks on the personnel of the United Nations Protection
Force (UNPROFOR), who are serving the cause of peace
in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since then
there has been another act of violence, yet again causing
the death of one of UNPROFOR's soldiers.

These cowardly murders and totally unacceptable.
They reflect a general deterioration in the situation in
Bosnia and Herzegovina and are likely, sooner or later, to
put UNPROFOR's missions there into the balance even
though the Force has contributed to easing tensions and
providing humanitarian assistance for the civilian
populations.

This being the case, it was a matter of urgency for the
Council to react by condemning these unacceptable acts
against the peace-keeping forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina
and for it to give a sign of its determination to have the
status of United Nations personnel there respected to the

 
letter. It was also essential to remind the Bosnian parties
of the vital need to extend the cease-fire and cessation-of-
hostilities agreements beyond 30 April next and to restart,
immediately, the negotiations towards an overall
settlement by accepting the Contact Group peace plan as
a starting point.

France, which is the United Nations premier troop
contributor, in Bosnia and Herzegovina in particular,
expects a positive response from the parties, without
delay, to Council's demands, and that UNPROFOR will
thus be in a position once again to carry out its mandate.
