Mr. Kuzmin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): | have asked for the floor again in connection with the statement made by the representative of Germany, in which he said that Russia and the Syrian regime continue their bombing. I would like to ask his purpose in making such accusations. Because he has not been working at the United Nations very long, he may not know that, here in the Security Council, we must comply with the norms of diplomatic politeness and etiquette. We do not call the Government of a sovereign State a "regime", at least not here. With regard to the accusations, the United Nations is often subject to attempted abuse and manipulation aimed at promoting narrow political interests. The representative of Germany probably knows that, facing certain pressures, the United Nations established the so-called Board of Inquiry to investigate a series of incidents that have occurred in north-western Syria, but the Board has actually refuted the accusations of strikes by the Russian Armed Forces on civilian objects, including schools. We held a special press conference on this topic at the United Nations on 16 September 2019, at which we provided evidence. We also circulated as an official document of the Security Council the materials resulting from this investigation by the Russian Ministry of Defence that clearly and firmly refuted these accusations. Unfortunately, it has become a regular practice to trust unverified, clearly false data. We call such information fake. I presume that the representative of Germany has a big problem with information sources. We are very well aware why he so painstakingly conceals them. I assure the Council that Russia will continue to comply with its obligations under international humanitarian law. The representative of Germany has highlighted on several occasions that the Russian Air Force is using effective systems to verify its targets, which rules out the possibility of striking civilian facilities.
