The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received letters from the representatives of
Ethiopia, Italy, Kuwait, the Netherlands and Tunisia, in
which they request to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives to
participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Mohammed
(Ethiopia), Mr. Fulci (Italy), Mr. Abulhasan (Kuwait),
Mr. Berteling (Netherlands) and Mr. Abdellah
(Tunisia) took the seats reserved for them at the side
of the Council Chamber.

The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to document S/l997/324, which contains the
text of a letter dated 16 April 1997 from the Charge
d'affaires ad interim of the Permanent Mission of Kuwait
to the United Nations addressed to the President of the
Security Council, transmitting the text of resolution 5638,
of 31 March 1997, adopted at the one hundred and seventh
regular session of the Council of the League of Arab States,
entitled "The situation in Somalia".
