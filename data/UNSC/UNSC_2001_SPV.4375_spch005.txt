The President (spoke in French): As the
representatives of missions that are seated in the
Chamber, but not at the table, will have understood, the
Council had a constructive discussion during its
consultations on ways of enhancing the usefulness of
the Council's annual report to the General Assembly.

I think that it is good to review, from time to
time, procedures that year after year become routine.
The Council is not the only United Nations body to be
affected by routine, but it does wish, whenever
possible, to enhance its working methods. One example
is the transparency of our meetings. Indeed, we are
trying to increase the number of Council meetings that
are open to all Members of the United Nations. This is
the case for the troop-contributing countries. We
adopted resolution 1353 (2001) and were able to
implement it this month, through two lengthy meetings
featuring dialogue and consultation with the troop-
contributing countries, on Sierra Leone and on Ethiopia
and Eritrea.
Let me give a third example, though there are
certainly more. We have begun a debate at the
ambassadorial level on the annual report that our
Council submits to the Assembly. The working group
will meet in a few days, so that - as Ambassador
Mahbubani said - this year, when the train leaves, it
will do so in a spirit of reform, with the goal of
enhancing the preparation of the report and maximizing
its usefulness to the General Assembly.

May I take that the draft report, as corrected, is
adopted by the Council?

There being no objection, it is so decided.

This decision will be reflected in a note by the
President of the Security Council, to be issued in
document S/2001/876.

The Security Council has thus concluded its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 6pm.
