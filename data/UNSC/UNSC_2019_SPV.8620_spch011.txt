Mr. Pecsteen de Buytswerve (Belgium) (spoke in French): Belgium today voted in favour of the
compromise resolution 2489 (2019), on extending the
mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in
Afghanistan (UNAMA). The language of the resolution
provides UNAMA with a significant mandate, as
well as the necessary political guidance to carry out
its mission. We regret, however, that reaching a more
substantial outcome was not possible owing, frankly, to
an issue not pertaining to the mandate.

We thank both co-penholders for their efforts to
ensure a transparent process and take into account the
views of every delegation. During the negotiations, our
delegation was fully and actively engaged in shoring
up the guidance that the Security Council will provide
the Mission. We placed particular focus on the issues
concerning the situation of children; women and peace
and security; demining; international humanitarian
law; and climate and security.

In conclusion, I reaffirm Belgium's support for
UNAMA and the Afghan people and express our
unwavering solidarity with the latter on the heels of the
latest attack that they just experienced.
