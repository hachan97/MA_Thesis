Mr. Dangue Rewaka (Gabon) (interpretation from French): First of all, I would like to thank you for the very
kind words you addressed to me and to express the great
pleasure I take in seeing you preside over our meeting. In
addition, I would like to express our best wishes for success
under your presidency.

I should like to reiterate our congratulations and
appreciation to the Secretary-General, which the Gabonese
authorities expressed to him upon his conclusion of the
Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of
Iraq on 23 February 1998. Indeed, this agreement has
helped defuse a critical situation that threatened to darken
the horizon of international relations.

Now, when the Security Council is about to adopt the
draft resolution before it, I think it is useful to recall the
importance of this meeting. For us this meeting is an
opportunity to solemnly reaffirm the confidence the
Security Council continues to have in the Secretary-General
for the full implementation of the Memorandum of
Understanding he signed with the Iraqi authorities.

My delegation strongly hopes that the Iraqi
authorities will take advantage of the favourable climate
thus created to translate the commitments undertake into
deeds. We are convinced that Iraq's strict compliance
with these commitments will enable the Security Council
to consider in due course the possibility of lifting the
sanctions that have so harshly stricken and punished the
Iraqi people.

There is no reason to believe that the Iraqi
Government, which has made a solemn commitment
before the international community, will not keep its
promises. We believe that if the Iraqi authorities failed to
meet their obligations, the Security Council would draw
its conclusions and would not hesitate to give an
immediate and appropriate response.

In view of all these considerations, my delegation
will vote in favour of the draft resolution.
