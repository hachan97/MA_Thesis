Mr. Heusgen (Germany): I would first like to
support and underline what you about the White
Helmets, Madam President. However, I would like to
ask a question of the Russian representative relating
to what you said about the board of inquiry and with
regard to the press conference that Russia gave some
weeks ago about the attacks conducted in Syria and
who was behind them. In that context, I note that today
there are news reports about the board of inquiry and
the possibility that Russia might be putting pressure on
the Secretary-General to keep its findings secret. Ijust
wanted to ask the Russian representative to assure us
that this is not the case and that he fully supports the
board of inquiry and the publication of its results.
