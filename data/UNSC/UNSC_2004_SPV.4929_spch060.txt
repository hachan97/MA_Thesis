Mr. Lovald (Norway): My delegation aligns
itself with the statement made earlier by the Presidency
of the European Union.

In addition, I should like to state the following.
Norway condemns the killing yesterday of Hamas
leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. This act will lead to
greater tension in the area and will impede the
implementation of the road map for peace and Israel's
withdrawal from Gaza. We realize that Hamas has been
responsible for a number of terrorist operations, which
we have deeply deplored. That does not, however,
justify extrajudicial killings such as the one we have
just seen.

That recent killing has created an extremely
dangerous situation. Norway urges the parties to refrain
from further violence and to lay the groundwork as
soon as possible so that the road map for peace can be
implemented. Efforts to implement an agreed Israeli
withdrawal from Gaza must be given top priority.
