Mr. Akbar (Pakistan): We are grateful to you,
Mr. President, for giving us the floor for a second time to
set the record straight on a matter of crucial importance to
the Security Council itself, to Pakistan and to the
international community. The matter to which we are
referring has been under consideration by the Security
Council for the last 50 years. We deeply regret that another
effort was made by India today to distort the facts, which
are well known to the Security Council, as it has been the
guardian of its own resolutions which it passed 50 years
ago.

We would like to remind the Council that, in
accordance with its resolutions of 50 years ago, the state of
Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed territory. The Council
had promised the people of the state of Jammu and
Kashmir that they would exercise their right to self-
determination in a United Nations-supervised plebiscite.
This promise, unfortunately, has not been fulfilled.

The Council will know that India has consistently
and wilfully obstructed the will of the international
community to implement the Council's resolution on the
situation in Jammu and Kashmir adopted under the
India/Pakistan question. India has deployed more than
600,000 troops in Indian-held Kashmir. These troops have
committed the worst kinds of acts of state terrorism
against the innocent people of Kashmir. International
human rights organizations have catalogued those massive
violations of human rights, in which women have been
raped, places of religious worship have been desecrated
and entire villages have been burned.

India has violated every norm of international
behaviour in its ruthless campaign to suppress and
eliminate the legitimate struggle of the Kashmiri people
and to keep those people under subjugation. It has also
extended its acts of terrorism beyond its territory.

We strongly denounce any effort to distort these
facts.
