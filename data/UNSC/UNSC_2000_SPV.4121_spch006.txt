Mr. Wang Yingfan (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
Chinese delegation would like to thank the Secretary-
General for the report that he has provided to us. We also
thank the Under-Secretary-General, Mr. Prendergast, for his
additional briefing.

Recently, the situation in Guinea-Bissau has remained
stable, and Guinea-Bissau's relations with neighbouring
countries have further improved. The current humanitarian
situation in Guinea-Bissau has also improved. We are
satisfied with developments in Guinea-Bissau. Since it came
into office, the new Government has committed itself to
reform and has adopted positive measures in that regard.
We express our appreciation for all this.

We agree with the observation in the report of the
Secretary-General that Guinea-Bissau is at present at a
critical crossroad. We encourage the Government of
Guinea-Bissau to continue its efforts to enhance national
reconciliation, consolidate constitutional rule and begin
economic reconstruction at an early date so that peace and
stability in that country can be maintained.

At the same time, we call upon the international
community to continue to give attention and support to
Guinea-Bissau and to support the peace process in
particular. In this regard, we would like to thank the
Economic Community of West African States and the
Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries for the
enormous efforts that they have been making for a long
time. We would also like to thank the Representative of
the Secretary-General, Mr. Nana-Sinkam, and the United
Nations Peace-building Support Office in Guinea-Bissau,
for the positive role that they have played in the peace
process in Guinea-Bissau. We also hope that, in the year
to come, they will continue to work tirelessly for peace
and development in Guinea-Bissau.

Before concluding, I should like to say that we
support the draft presidential statement, which will be
adopted later.
