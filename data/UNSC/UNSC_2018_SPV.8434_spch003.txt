The President (spoke in French): I thank Mr. De
Mistura for his briefing.

I should like to tell him how pleased and proud
we are of the work that he has been able to achieve in
Syria. The warm round of applause he has just received
underlines the great interest we take in his work and
our deep satisfaction with it. That round of applause
is worth all of the speeches of thanks in the world. I
ask him to accept that gratitude and that applause as
a symbol of and testament to our sincere and warm
gratitude.

I now give the floor to those members of the
Security Council who wish to make statements.
