Mrs. Albright (United States of America): I am
sorry that the representative of the Observer Mission of
Palestine has so misinterpreted and misunderstood my
statement in explanation of vote. I do not think that he
actually heard what I said. I think it is very important for
both parties to proceed with the peace process pursuant to
their obligations under the Declaration of Principles, and
I regret very much that he has misunderstood the position
of the United States and the role of the Security Council.
