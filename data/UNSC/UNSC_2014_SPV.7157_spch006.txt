Mr. Cherif (Chad) (spoke in French): I would first

like to thank Mr. Ivan Simonovie, Assistant Secretary-
General for Human Rights, for his briefing.

Chad remains deeply concerned about the situation
in Ukraine, which has been marked by human rights
violations and violence likely to be lead to unforeseeable
and incalculable consequences. Chad condemns every
form of human rights violations and violence, wherever
they come from. We ask that an independent inquiry be
carried out to determine the respective responsibilities
of the various parties in the human rights violations
that have been committed. However, we believe that it
is difficult to clarify the situation with regard to human
rights violations without a modicum of stability and a
reduction of the prevailing tensions.

We therefore call on all the parties to exercise
restraint and calm and urge them once again to give
priority to finding a peaceful settlement of the crisis.
We believe that a political solution is possible within the
framework of direct and candid negotiations among the
relevant parties, mindful of the fundamental principles
enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the
concerns of all components of Ukrainian society in
all their diversity. Accordingly, we encourage all the
parties to give negotiations a chance and to back the
mediation efforts currently under way. We hope that the
meeting scheduled for 17 April in Geneva will enable
us to make progress in our search for a solution to the
cr1s1s.
