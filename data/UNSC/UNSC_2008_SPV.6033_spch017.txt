Mr. Weisleder (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish):
At the outset, I should like to thank the Chairman of
the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina
for his statement as well as the High Representative for
his report.

In order to avoid repeating the appeals to good
sense that have been made by the previous speakers,
which of course we fully share, I would like to read the
closing paragraph of the statement of the Chairman of
the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
He said: "I would like to thank High Representative
Miroslav Lajcak for his efforts for the benefit of
Bosnia and Herzegovina, even though I wish his report
were more optimistic and not as selective."

In that respect, my delegation feels that it would
be more conducive to attaining the objectives that I
believe we all share if the leaders on all sides were to
adjust their thinking and attitude with respect to
paragraphs that may or may not be included in the
High Representative's reports. There were serious and
difficult confrontations in that area, and progress has
been made in the past 13 years, but attitudes must
change if the peace and progress that we all hope for
are to be achieved.
