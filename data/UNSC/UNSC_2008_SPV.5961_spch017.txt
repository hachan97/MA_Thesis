Mr. Alasania (Georgia): I have a very simple
question, but before posing that question I want to say
that the representative of the Russian Federation
referred to the massive humanitarian intervention, of a
kind that had not been seen before, which they are
performing in Georgia. I just want to assure
Mr. Churkin that the face of the Russian humanitarian
efforts is well shown by the facts on the ground, by the
destruction and the killings, and that it has been well
reported by international observers, human rights
observers and the international media, so I will not
elaborate more on that.

The simple question is this. I could not really get
a sense, regarding the very important issue on which
we are gathered here today, whether the Russian
Federation is intending to comply with the agreement
reached by the French presidency of the European
Union, to ceasefire and to end the occupation of the
sovereign State of Georgia. This is a very simple
question, but I really felt deliberate ambiguity in the
14

answers provided by the Russian Federation's
Permanent Representative. And by refusing to support
the French-sponsored draft resolution, does that in
effect mean that they are refusing to ceasefire in
Georgia?
