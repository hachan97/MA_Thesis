Ms. Lucas (Luxembourg) (spoke in French): I
also thank the Under-Secretary-General for Political
Affairs, Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, for his briefing.

At the start ofmy remarks, Iwish to express, on behalf
of the Government and the people of Luxembourg, my
most sincere condolences to the families and relatives
of the 298 people aboard the Malaysia Airlines aircraft
that crashed yesterday afternoon near the village
of Grabovo in eastern Ukraine. Among the victims
was a Dutch-English family living in Luxembourg.
Our sympathy also goes out to the Governments and
the peoples of the Netherlands, Malaysia, Germany,
Australia, Belgium, Canada, Indonesia, New Zealand,
the Philippines and the United Kingdom.

The international community owes it to the victims
to shed light on the circumstances that led to this tragic
event. A transparent and independent comprehensive
international investigation must be completed as soon
as possible. Safe and unhindered access must be granted
to international investigators, as well as to observers
from the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe (OSCE) and representatives of affected
countries. All parties involved should fully cooperate
to that end. We commend the Ukrainian authorities
in that regard. Those who committed this heinous act
must be held accountable.

This air disaster took place in a context of the
ongoing deterioration of the situation in the east of
Ukraine. Day after day, we receive reports of civilians
killed in fighting between the Ukrainian armed forces
and illegal armed groups. The pro-Russian separatist
militias continue to occupy buildings and border posts,
hold dozens of innocent people hostage and threaten the
territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of
Ukraine. The living conditions ofpeople living in areas
affected by the hostilities continue to deteriorate, and
the number of internally displaced persons has steadily
increased.

The escalation of violence in recent days, until its
tragic climax yesterday, demonstrates once again that
active armed groups in eastern Ukraine are actually
well-equipped and well-trained paramilitary forces
who enjoy clear external support.

We urge the Russian Federation to actively use its
influence on the illegal armed groups and ensure that
weapons and fighters can no longer cross the border, in
order to bring about a de-escalation as soon as possible.
Throughout the past few months, Ukraine has
demonstrated its commitment to finding a peaceful
solution to the crisis and to implementing the agreements
concluded, in particular the joint declaration adopted
on 17 April in Geneva between Ukraine, Russia, the
European Union and the United States. Ukraine has
established a national dialogue and guarantees for
national minorities. Once elected, President Poroshenko
put forward a comprehensive peace plan and put in place
a unilateral ceasefire to create the conditions necessary
for its implementation. Unfortunately, illegal armed
groups, whose sole aim is to destabilize Ukraine, chose
not to take that outstretched hand.

Diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful solution to the
crisis in eastern Ukraine must continue. In that regard,
the personal commitment of the Secretary-General
since the beginning of the crisis is essential and must
continue.

It is important to urgently reach an agreement
on a real and lasting ceasefire that is observed by all
parties, so as to create the conditions necessary for the
implementation of President Poroshenko's peace plan.

We welcome the efforts made in that regard by
France, Germany and the OSCE to promote dialogue
between Russia and Ukraine. We sincerely hope that
those efforts will contribute to a de-escalation and
put an end to a crisis that has gone on for too long.
Yesterday's plane crash demonstrated the incalculable
consequences that the crisis can have. It is high time for
all stakeholders, including the Russian Federation, to
mobilize all energies to put an end to this crisis.
