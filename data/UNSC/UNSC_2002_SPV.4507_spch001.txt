The President (spoke in Russian): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Ms. Catherine Bertini, Executive Director
of the World Food Programme.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Ms. Bertini to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

I invite the members of the Council to hear a
briefing by the Executive Director of the World Food
Programme, Ms. Catherine Bertini. I now give the floor
to Ms. Bertini.
