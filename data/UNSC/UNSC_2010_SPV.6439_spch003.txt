The President: I thank Mr. Petrie for his briefing.
On behalf of the Council, I should also like to express
our gratitude to Mr. Petrie, who, as he just mentioned,
has made his last briefing to the Council in his capacity
as Executive Representative of the Secretary-General
for Burundi and head of the United Nations Integrated
Office in Burundi. We have appreciated his effective
leadership of that important Office and his service to
the United Nations over the years. We wish him every
success in his future endeavours.

I now give the floor to Mr. Paul Seger.
