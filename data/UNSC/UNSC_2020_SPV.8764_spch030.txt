The President (spoke in Russian): Since the representative of the United Kingdom addressed some of his comments not to Russia but to me personally as the President of the Security Council, I feel compelled to comment on them, as follows. I was not the person who proposed that we vote on the briefer. It was the United Kingdom that proposed that we put this question to a vote, which, as President of the Security Council, I did. In his position, I would have thanked the presidency for putting this question to the vote using the wording that he proposed, even though I am absolutely convinced that the argument about what form the question should be put to the vote in was absolutely legitimate. He knows very well that if we had put it to the vote in a different form, he would not have won the vote. On the invitation to Director General Arias, which we talked about today - and now I am speaking in my national capacity - it was we who put up that proposal. I hope that when it is proposed that he deliver a briefing at our next regular open meeting on the Syrian chemical issue, the representative of the United Kingdom will not put that question to a vote.
