The President: I shall now make a statement in
my capacity as the representative of Viet Nam.

Viet Nam voted in favour of the draft resolution
contained in document S/2008/506 in accordance with
our policy supporting the full and expeditious
deployment of the African Union-United Nations
Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) and, hence, the
renewal of UNAMID's mandate for another 12 months,
until 31 July 2009.

We would like to thank the delegation of the
United Kingdom for having submitted the draft
resolution on which we have just voted. We note with
appreciation that our contributions have been reflected
in the text of the resolution. Viet Nam holds that the
Council must take a comprehensive approach to the
Darfur conflict, which requires that attention be
devoted equally to peace and justice; to the peace and
political processes; to UNAMID's deployment and the

safety of its staff, with a view to ensuring its effective
operation; and to reconciliation in Darfur and in the
Sudan at large.

We share the concerns of the African Union, the
League of Arab States and the Non-Aligned
Movement, as well as those of many United Nations
Member States and Council members, about the
possible negative impact of a potential indictment
requested by the International Criminal Court
Prosecutor against the President of the Sudan on the
peace process in that country and on the very operation
of UNAMID. We take note of the fact that those
concerns are reflected in the ninth preambular
paragraph of the resolution.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

I now give the floor to the representative of the
Sudan.
