Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): We
welcome the adoption of resolution 2081 (2012), and we
regret that consensus on it was not possible.

I reiterate the United Kingdom's full support for
the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia. The resolution we have adopted today
enables the judges to continue to play their part in the
Tribunal's work. We fully respect the independent and
impartial way in which they do so.

We commend the Tribunal for the creative way that
it has been addressing the issue of staffretention and for
the steps that it has taken under the able leadership of
President Meron to improve efficiency and to complete
its work as expeditiously as possible. We are confident
that the Tribunal will continue to do everything that it
can in that regard.

It is of particular note that only two trials - those
of Mr. Mladie and Mr. Hadiie, who were arrested last
year - are scheduled to go beyond the original target
date of 31 December 2014.

We reaffirm our commitment to help the Tribunal
to complete the mandate that the Security Council
conferred upon it. The Tribunal plays an essential role
in the fight against impunity and in delivering justice
to the countless victims of atrocities in the former
Yugoslavia. For that we owe it a debt of gratitude.
