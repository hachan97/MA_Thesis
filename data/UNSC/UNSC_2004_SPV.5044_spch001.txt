The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now proceed to the consideration of its
annual report to the General Assembly, the draft of
which has been prepared by the Secretariat.

Members of the Council have received copies of
the draft report of the Security Council to the General
Assembly for the period from 1 August 2003 to 31 July
2004, as circulated by the Assistant Secretary-General
for Political Affairs on 31 August 2004, and a
corrigendum thereto.

I should like to express appreciation to the
Secretariat for the work it has undertaken in preparing
this factual report and in a timely manner.

I now call on Mr. Kalomoh, Assistant Secretary-
General for Political Affairs, to make an explanatory
statement.
