Mr. Tang (Turkey): Over the past few years we
have witnessed remarkable developments in the Middle
East. The bold steps taken on the difficult road towards
peace have aroused expectations and excitement. Turkey
wholeheartedly supports the Middle East peace process.
At this significant point in time, Turkey attaches the
highest importance to preservation of the momentum
towards achieving peace, security, stability and prosperity
in the Middle East.

At present, terrorism is the biggest danger to the
peace process. The struggle against terrorism is the
legitimate right of the countries of the region. Terrorism
must be eliminated in order for the quest for peace and
stability in the Middle East to succeed. At the same time,
it is necessary that no harm should come to innocent
people while this struggle is being carried out, and that
the fight against terrorist acts remain within the bounds of
lawfulness.

Another crucial element is the support being given
by the Palestinian people to the peace process.
Palestinians have recently established, through a
democratic election, a legitimate administration. In order
to maintain their support, it is important that the economic
hardships encountered by the Palestinian people as a
result of the measures taken by Israel be eliminated
without delay, because improvement in economic
conditions is one of the most important factors in
ensuring the attachment of people to peace.

The punishment of the Palestinian people as a whole
is not acceptable. We are concerned that this will weaken
the support of Palestinians for the peace process.

Having strongly supported the peace process from
the very beginning, Turkey believes that in fighting
terrorism it is necessary for all the countries in the region
to cooperate and to stand in solidarity with each other.
