Mr. Oyarzun Marchesi (Spain) (spoke in Spanish):
I have the honour to present the report of the Security
Council Committee established pursuant to resolution
1737 (2006), in accordance with paragraph 18 of that
resolution. The present report covers the period from
24 March to 22 June, during which time the Committee
held an informal meeting on 1 June and carried out
additional activities, using the no-objection procedure
provided for in paragraph 15 of the guidelines for
conducting its work.

Taking into account the evolution of events relating
to the Joint Plan of Action, the Committee reiterates its
support to all parties in their efforts to hold negotiations
aimed at achieving a broad agreement.

I would like to reiterate that the measures imposed
by the Security Council under resolutions 1737 (2006),
1747 (2007), 1803 (2008) and 1929 (2010) remain
in full effect while negotiations between the P5+l
and the Islamic Republic of Iran continue, and that
Member States remain under the obligation to apply
them. The Committee continues to fully support the
implementation of all relevant resolutions and stands
ready to provide guidance to those Member States that
request assistance.

During the reporting period, the Committee was
informed of no new incidents. With respect to prior
events investigated by the Panel of Experts, I would like
to recall that the Committee has been in touch with the
Islamic Republic of Iran on a number of occasions in
order to convey its observations. The Islamic Republic
of Iran has not yet responded, and the Committee
continues to urge it to do so.

The Committee continues to provide States
and international organizations with assistance in
implementing the relevant Security Council measures.
That includes analysing whether or not the proposals
for technical assistance to the Islamic Republic of
Iran, which cover a broad array of fields, from energy
efficiency to the protection of the ozone layer, as
well as proposals for other kinds of cooperation, are
in violation of the sanctions regimes. The Committee
welcomes such collaboration on matters relating to
implementation and compliance, and encourages the
parties to continue to request the Committee's guidance
with respect to the implementation of the Council's
measures.

In accordance with paragraph 5 of resolution 1737
(2006), the Committee was notified by one Member
State about the expected delivery of equipment to be
used in a light-water reactor at the Bushehr nuclear
plant. Regarding actions taken by Member States
to implement the relevant measures of the Security
Council, the Committee encourages those Member
States that have not yet submitted reports to do so as
soon as possible, in recognition of the importance of
national implementation reports for promoting the
implementation of sanctions measures.

With regard to the Panel of Experts, the Committee
heard a briefing on the final report on the mandate of
the Panel of Experts (S/2015/401) in the framework of
its informal consultations, which were held on 1 June,
and had the opportunity to review that report with the
Panel, as required in paragraph 2 of resolution 2159
(2014). On 1 June the Council received the report, the
text ofwhich may be viewed in all the official languages
of the United Nations. The report contains observations
that can serve as a useful guide for Member States
when it comes time to implement the measures set forth
in resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007), 1803 (2008)
and 1929 (2010). The Committee notes that the Panel
has not issued any new recommendations in addition
to those contained in its previous final reports. The
Committee will continue to study the report and to
consider whether additional follow-up measures will be
needed in the light of its conclusions.

Furthermore, I would like to state that, following
the 9 June decision adopted by the Council in resolution
2224 (2015) to extend the mandate of the Panel of
Experts until 9 July 2016, the Bureau has undertaken
the required administrative procedures concerning
nominations to the Panel. With respect to the activities
conducted by the Panel over the past three months, I wish
to point out that it participated in a series of activities
that are enumerated in the annex to the current report.

Finally, while the Committee reiterates that the
primary responsibility for applying the provisions of
resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007), 1803 (2008) and
1929 (2010) resides with Member States, the Committee
is prepared to facilitate the implementation of those
measures.
