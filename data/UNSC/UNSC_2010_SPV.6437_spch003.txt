The President: I would note that the
participation of the representative of Cote d'Ivoire in
this meeting without objection is not intended to be
viewed and should not be understood as an
acknowledgment of the legitimacy of his Government.

There are no further speakers on my list.

In accordance with the understanding reached in
the Council's prior consultations, I now invite Council
members to informal consultations to continue our
discussion on the subject.

The meeting rose at 10.30 a.m.
