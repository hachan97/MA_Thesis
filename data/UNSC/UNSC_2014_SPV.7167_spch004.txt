Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian delegation called for today's
emergency meeting of the Security Council with a view
to considering the resumed punitive military operations
undertaken by the authorities of the Kyiv regime,
involving terrorists, the pro-fascist Right Sector and
other ultranationalist organizations against their own
people in south-eastern Ukraine. A sub-unit of the
Ukrainian army is using tanks, other heavy artillery
and military helicopters to launch rocket striles against
protesters and land troops. The first blood has already
been spilled and reports are coming in about the killed
and wounded. If the criminal misadventures of the Kyiv
clique are not swiftly stopped, a catastrophic outcome
for Ukraine cannot be averted. We have warned of this
on many occasions.

Punitive measures against its own people bear
witness to the current Kyiv Government's inability or
unwillingness to fulfil its obligations under the Geneva
declaration of 17 April to ensure a speedy end to all
violence and the launch of broad national dialogue,
with the participation of all regions and political forces.
If anyone entertained any doubts, it is now clear that
the many statements of the so-called Government of
Ukraine regarding its intention to begin nationwide
dialogue in the search of settlement to the far-reaching
crisis are nothing but hypocrisy. The regime in Kyiv,
having abrogated the agreement of 21 February, is now
openly violating its commitments under the Geneva
declaration of 17 April, which require an urgent
measures to end to all violence.
In essence, at a time when Russia is striving to
de-escalate and settle the crisis and - at the request
of our Western partners and in cooperation with
the leadership of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) - recently sent
a representative of the President of the Russian
Federation to Donetsk oblast in order to find a solution
to the situation of the military specialists from several
European countries, the Kyiv regime, with the support
of its Western sponsors, has launched the full-scale use
of military force, effectively annihilating any prospects
for the implementation of the Geneva agreement.

We are particularly concerned about information
that, in the course of the punitive operations undertaken
by the Ukrainian armed forces and illegal ultranationalist
groups, English has been heard being spoken on the
radio and English-speaking foreigners have been
identified among those attacking in Sloviansk. We insist
that all outside interference in the events in Ukraine is
unacceptable. It is time for our Western colleagues to
think twice, reason with their mentees in Ukraine, and
stop toying with the destiny of the Ukrainian people to
determine their own geopolitical goals.

How else can we interpret yet another blatant
example of the double standards wielded by the
United States? Following the numerous attempts
of Washington, DC, to tell Russia where and how
its military should be properly deployed in its own
territory, the White House has now been offended by our
appeal to the Kyiv Government to withdraw its forces
from eastern Ukraine. I recall that Washington, DC,
used frequently to ask former President Yanukovich
of Ukraine not to use force against his people, and
threatened him with all sorts of consequences. Now,
however, in a strange twist of logic, force may and must
be used against civilians by a Government that enjoys
no legitimacy.

The High Representative of the European Union
is not far behind her United States colleagues,
philosophizing about the State's monopoly on the
use of force. In the current context in Ukraine, her
statement can only be characterized as provocative and
inflammatory. It would seem that not only did the High
Representative not participate in signing the Geneva
declaration, but that she did not read it. In helping those
who organized the coup d'etat in Kyiv to crush the
protesters, the United States and the European Union
bear great responsibility for effectively destroying the
path to a peaceful solution to the crisis.

Against that backdrop, the categorical refusal
of Washington, DC, to support the continuation of
dialogue between the representatives of Kyiv and of
south-eastern Ukraine, under the auspices ofthe OSCE,
would hardly seem coincidental in its contravention of
the Geneva declaration fo 17 April. What could be a
more striking example than the fact that the United
States is bent on the use of force? We call on Kyiv, its
enablers and the signers of the Geneva declaration, the
United States and the European Union, not to commit a
fatal error and to make a sober assessment at all possible
consequences of their actions. We call firmly on the
West to end its destructive policy concerning Ukraine,
and on the self-proclaimed authorities in Kyiv to swiftly
halt all punitive operations and other measures against
the people, free political prisoners and guarantee full
freedom for journalists. That would represent a genuine
process of de-escalation.

There is a need for the urgent organization of
authentic and equitable political dialogue, with the
participation of all regions, to reach mutual agreement
on the future of the country, rather than pretend to
draft reforms within the small circle of self-styled
Government of winners. Those who gave the criminal
order to unleash bloodshed will bear full responsibility
for whatever happens in Ukraine.
