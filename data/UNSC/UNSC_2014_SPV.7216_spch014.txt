Mr. Cherif (Chad) (spoke in French): Chad
welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 2165
(2014). Chad thanks and commends the authors of the
resolution - Australia, Jordan and Luxembourg - for
having initiating the resolution and for having strongly
contributed to its adoption.

Chad hopes that the adoption of the resolution will
contribute to improving the humanitarian situation
in Syria, howsoever modestly, and to alleviating the
suffering of Syrian civilians. Chad calls on all parties
to the conflict to respect international humanitarian
law and to facilitate unhindered access of needy
civilian populations to humanitarian aid. Chad hopes
that resolution 2165 (2014) will prove to be more than
just one additional document, but that it will put an
end to the deliberate obstacles made to the delivery of
humanitarian aid.

Chad requests all parties to the conflict to
scrupulously respect the provisions of resolutions 2139
(2014) and 2165 (2014). The Security Council must
ensure their effective implementation by all parties to
the conflict. In order to put a final end to the suffering
of the Syrian people, the international community must
redouble its efforts to bring the parties to the conflict to
resume negotiations in order to find a lasting political
solution to the crisis.
