Mr. Hamer (Netherlands):I too thank Assistant
Secretary-General Annabi for his introduction of the
Secretary-General's report and for the additional
information he has provided.

Although the overall progress in the peace process is
encouraging, my delegation agrees with the Secretary-
General's conclusion that the move towards a stable
democracy has only just begun. While the holding of the
presidential and parliamentary elections was a significant
step in the development of democratic institutions, the
elections themselves were marred by significant flaws.

The presidential elections last November were not
monitored by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), because they failed to
meet the standards set by that organization. The
parliamentary elections on 27 February were the country's
first multi-party elections, but serious shortcomings in
those elections have led the Joint Electoral Observation
Mission to express serious doubts concerning the integrity
of the election results.

Despite these undeniable shortcomings, the trend
over the past few months has been encouraging. It is
precisely because much remains to be done in the way of
further democratization that the international community
must remain engaged in that process. That is why the
Netherlands fully endorses the Secretary-General's
proposal concerning a further role for the United Nations
in Tajikistan after the withdrawal of the United Nations
Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT).

Finally, we call on the Tajik authorities to ensure
that the forthcoming elections to the National Assembly
proceed in a free, fair and transparent manner.
