Mr. Umarov (Kazakhstan): We very much regret
that North Korea continues to tirelessly develop its
nuclear programme, which is in grave violation of
numerous Security Council resolutions. Proceeding
from its principled position on nuclear disarmament
and non-proliferation, Kazakhstan has supported the
new resolution 2397 (2017) on sanctions. We hope
that it will send a very clear and definite message to
Pyongyang that the world community does not approve
of North Korea's nuclear policy.

Joining the international community, we wish to
lead the Democratic People's Republic ofKorea to a very
clear understanding of the cause-and-effect relationship

of its actions and of what is happening, namely, that
these actions are the outcome of its utter disregard
of its obligations under Council resolutions. We have
learned from Under-Secretary-General Feltman's
recent Visit that Pyongyang receives the decisions ofthe
Security Council in a different way - as new perilous
circumstances that have been inflicted on it, rather than
as consequences of its nuclear track, which is totally
unacceptable to the world community.

This is happening partly due to the lack of mutual
understanding and dialogue, which are often most
difficult and demanding to pursue but will nevertheless
lead to optimal positive gains for all. Seeking the
path of peace is the only way to save us from making
irreparable mistakes, prevent major catastrophes, lead
to a common goodwill and fulfil the world's wish to
move towards a peaceful future. In that regard, we call
on all parties to settle down to a course of peaceful
solutions, mediation and interaction in which the
sanctions are just an interim phase of the long-awaited
way to peace and stability on the Korean peninsula.
