Mr. Kama] (Pakistan): Allow me at the outset to
express my pleasure at addressing the Council under your
distinguished presidency, Sir, and our appreciation to your
predecessor for the excellent manner in which he
conducted the affairs of the Council during the previous
month.

My delegation would like to congratulate the
Secretary-General for his sincere and sustained efforts in
finding a peaceful resolution of the crisis in the Gulf. We
welcome the Security Council's endorsement of the
agreement which he so painstakingly negotiated in
Baghdad. In the end, good sense and wisdom appear to
have prevailed, and we can all rejoice.

Pakistan's principled position on this issue is well
known. In a letter addressed to the Secretary-General on
21 February 1998, the Prime Minister of Pakistan
reiterated that,

"Pakistan supports the full implementation, in letter
and spirit, of all United Nations resolutions without
exception, whether they pertain to Iraq, Kashmir,
Palestine or any other issue".

Pakistan upholds the principle of sovereignty and
territorial integrity of all countries. We have constantly
advised against the use of force. Military action against
Iraq would only increase the hardships of the innocent
Iraqi people, who have already suffered gravely over the
last seven years due to the sanctions and deprivations
imposed on them.

Pakistan earnestly hopes that the approval of the
Memorandum of Understanding by the Security Council
will pave the way for the full and scrupulous
implementation of the relevant Security Council
resolutions, as well as for the early lifting of sanctions
against Iraq. We urge all parties to faithfully fulfil their
respective obligations under the Memorandum of
Understanding so that that day can dawn soon.
