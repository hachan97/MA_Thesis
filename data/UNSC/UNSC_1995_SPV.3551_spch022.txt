The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank
the representative of China for the kind words he addressed
to me.

I shall now make a statement in my capacity as
representative of Honduras.

My delegation was pleased to receive the
conclusions of the Co-Chairmen of the Steering
Committee of the International Conference on the Former
Yugoslavia (ICFY) and the Committee's certification of
the closure of the borders between the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia and those areas of the Republic of Bosnia
and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb
forces, as contained in the report submitted by the
Secretary-General on the activities of the Mission of the
Conference.

We are grateful for that report, which concludes by
certifying that the Government of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia continues to fulfil its commitment to close the
border with Bosnia and Herzegovina and that there have
been no commercial transshipments across that border.
My delegation also notes that the Mission of the
Conference, some minor incidents notwithstanding, enjoys
full freedom of movement in that country and enjoys the
cooperation of the Yugoslav authorities, which are
effectively implementing the legislation relating to the
closure of the border.

We hope that the adoption of today's resolution, for
which my delegation voted in favour, will serve to
stimulate the authorities of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia to step up their efforts to make the closure of
the international border more effective.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

There are no further speakers. The Security Council
has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration
of the item on its agenda. The Security Council will
remain seized of the matter.

The meeting rose at 5.50 pm.
