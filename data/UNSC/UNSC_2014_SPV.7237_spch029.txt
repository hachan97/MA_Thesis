Mr. Gasana (Rwanda): It is not a big issue; I
just wanted to make a slight clarification. I want to
thank you, Mr. President, and assure you that I will
not take much of your time. Allow me to make just
one clarification on what our good friend Minister
Tshibanda N'tungamulongo has said with regard to
the denial by Rwanda of a team from the Democratic
Republic of the Congo to meet the ex-combatants.

The Council will recall that on 24 April, at around
4 pm. Kinshasa time, our Embassy in Kinshasa
received a note from the Democratic Republic of the
Congo Ministry of Foreign Affairs announcing its
intention to send to Rwanda a lO-man team in the days
ahead, without indicating specific dates. The following
morning at 8:45 am. exactly, on 25 April, the Congolese
team showed up at our border, before the Democratic
Republic of the Congo Embassy in Kigali was even
able to submit a formal request to the Government of
Rwanda.

On the same day, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs
wrote back to the Government of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo noting that the delegation had
showed up ahead of the request pertaining to the visit
and that therefore no arrangements had been made to
receive them. The letter also requested the Democratic
Republic of the Congo to propose a suitable date for
the delegation's visit. That was done and the visit took
place, finally, from 18 to 20 July.
