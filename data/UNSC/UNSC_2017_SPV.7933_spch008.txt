Mr. Wilson (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom welcomes the adoption of resolution 2351
(2017), which renews the mandate of the United
Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara
(MINURSO) and provides clear direction for the
crucial work of MINURSO over the next 12 months.
I particularly want to thank the United States for its
hard work on the text of the resolution and my fellow
Council members for the positive and constructive
spirit in which negotiations took place this year.

Today's forward-looking resolution marks an
important step in the path towards finding a solution
to this decades-old conflict. Through this unanimous
adoption, we have demonstrated the support within the
Chamber for the vital mission ofMINURSO. I especially
welcome the strong commitment and support of the
Secretary-General to relaunch the negotiating process
with the aim of reaching a mutually acceptable political
solution. I hope his personal involvement and the swift
appointment ofa new personal envoy will encourage all
parties to cooperate fully with the United Nations over
the next 12 months to achieve real progress. I also want
to take this opportunity to thank Christopher Ross for
his tireless commitment over the past eight years and
for his endless search for a solution to this problem.

In conclusion, it is clear that this issue can be
resolved only if progress is made on the political
track. The Council has an important role to play in
supporting MINURSO, the Secretary-General and his
Personal Envoy. Today's resolution is an important tool
in support of the negotiation process and the efforts to
achieve a mutually acceptable political solution. The
United Kingdom, as ever, stands ready to support both
parties in their efforts to achieve that goal.
