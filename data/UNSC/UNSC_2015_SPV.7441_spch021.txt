Ms. Bensouda: On the issue of the contact group
which the representative of Spain raised, I welcome
the interest of Spain and of others in what, I believe,
could be a very important transformative process. I
can already say that we have helped to facilitate initial
discussions between Libya and several Rome Statute
State parties. We are happy to be able to help bring
other interested parties into that discussion, but, as we
always say, Libya must take ownership of this process
ifit is to succeed.

I envisage that such a contact group would ensure
a systematic and sustained focus on the issues of
justice and accountability in Libya and also serve as a
forum for brainstorming on how institutional capacity
in Libya can be strengthened. The group could also
systematically look at the challenges and needs of
the Government of Libya to meet its obligations with
respect to cooperation with the International Criminal
Court and to advance the course of justice in Libya. I
also think such a contact group could facilitate and pool
resources and receive assistance from willing States
for capacity-building in Libya, taking into account the
issue of complementarity. Those are some of the ideas
we have had that suggest such a contact group could be
very useful.
