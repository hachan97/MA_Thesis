The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Lieutenant General Mgwebi for his briefing. I recall
that some of thoese subjects were referred to during the
Council's visit to the Democratic Republic of the Congo
last year and are certainly relevant to the Council's
work.

I give the floor to Major General Menon.
