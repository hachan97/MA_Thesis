Mr. Malwal (South Sudan): I would like to
congratulate you, Sir, on your presidency of the Security
Council for the month of October. We would also like to
thank you, and through you the Government of Bolivia,
for the close working relationship we have enjoyed with
you during Bolivia's tenure in the Security Council.
Given that this is probably your last presidency, I would
like to take this opportunity to wish you all the best.

On behalf of the Republic of South Sudan, I would
like to thank the Council on the decision to renew
the mandate of the United Nations Interim Security
Force for Abyei. The fact that the Council approved
its extention, albeit for six months and with the
current troop ceiling maintained, is reassuring to the
communities in Abyei. Accordingly, the Government of
the Republic of South Sudan would like to reaffirm its
commitment to continue engaging the Council until a
final solution to the Abyei issue is found.

In conclusion, we would like to thank the Ethiopian
Government for its steadfast dedication to maintaining
peace and stability in Abyei.
The meeting rose at 3.10pm.
