Mr. Vitrenko (Ukraine): I apologize for taking the
floor once again. The Russian representative omitted
to mention one particular point, which is that Ukraine
is defending its own territory, territorial integrity and
sovereignty against Russian aggression.

Lastly, the Russian delegation's carefully prepared
statement and data speak to major preparation on its
part for this meeting, which is somewhat ominous,
as if Russia were preparing for a further phase of
military aggression against Ukraine, which I hope does
not materialize.
