The President (spoke in Spanish): There are no
further speakers inscribed on my list. The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

On the basis of today's open debate, the
presidency will prepare a draft presidential statement
reflecting the views expressed and will submit it for the
consideration of the members of the Council during the
course of the next week.

I would like to express my thanks to all of the
speakers who have participated in this debate, and I
particularly thank them for the interest shown in this
item, which I am sure we all share. I believe it has been
a very enriching debate that will enable the Security
Council to move forward in its work with a more
comprehensive vision of the subject. Again, let me
thank all participating delegations. They have shown
that the results of our Conference have been positive
and constitute the first step in the right direction.

The meeting rose at 7.05 pm.
