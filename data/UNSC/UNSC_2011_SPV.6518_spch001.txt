The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2011/257, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Bosnia and Herzegovina,
China, Colombia, France, Gabon, Germany, Lebanon,
Nigeria, Portugal, the Russian Federation, South
Africa, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and the United States of America.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.

A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
Colombia, France, Gabon, Germany, India,
Lebanon, Nigeria, Portugal, Russian Federation,
South Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland, United States of America.

The President (spoke in Spanish): There were
15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has thus been
adopted unanimously as resolution 1977 (2011).

I now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements after the voting.
