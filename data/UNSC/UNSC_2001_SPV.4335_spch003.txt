The President: Allow me to bring to the
Council's attention the fact that the report of the
Security Council mission to Kosovo was presented to
the Council in a public meeting on 19 June, the first
available afternoon following the return of the mission
to New York. The official record of that meeting is
available in document S/PV.4331 and provides a
verbatim record of the presentation that was made on
the mission and its findings.

The findings of the mission are contained in
paragraphs 29-39 of document S/2001/600. These are
very well articulated, carefully considered and intended
to make progress in the resolution of outstanding issues
in Kosovo and in enhancing the democratic process
there. As Mr. J ean-Marie Guehenno just mentioned, the
Council mission conveyed a very firm and balanced
message during its visit and we hope that it will make
some difference in the situation there. Again, I would
draw the Council's attention to the findings of the
mission and urge it to consider them for further action
in this area.
