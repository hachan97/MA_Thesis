Mr. Du Xiacong (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
Chinese delegation welcomes the briefings by
Mr. Moussa and Mr. Bassole on the latest
developments in the Ivorian situation. China has been
greatly concerned about developments in that situation.
We sincerely hope that peace and stability will be
restored to Cote d'Ivoire and that the well-being of its
people will be secured. It is heartening to note that a
positive political atmosphere has been maintained in
the peace process since the signing of the
Ouagadougou Agreement, and that concrete progress
has been made. The security situation in Cote d'Ivoire
remains calm and the volatile situation in the west
continues to improve. China appreciates the efforts
made by President Gbagbo and Prime Minister Soro
and by all the Ivorian parties. We also appreciate the
positive role played by President Compaore as
Facilitator for the Ivorian issue. Granted, the Ivorian
peace process will by no means be a simple matter; it
requires considerable effort by all parties. China urges
all Ivorian parties to continue to look at the big picture,
to maintain mutual political confidence and to consult
and work with one another in a cooperative spirit.

Undertaking such tasks as the disarmament of
ex-combatants, the reconstruction of administrative
institutions, the registration of voters and the
identification of the population will create favourable
conditions for the general election. The United Nations
should strengthen its coordination with regional and
subregional organizations including the African Union
and the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) and should continue to provide necessary
assistance to C6te d'Ivoire. China stands ready to
continue to make its own contributions.
