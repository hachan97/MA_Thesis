Ms. Bachelet: I thank you again, Mr. President,
for giving me the opportunity of participating in this
important discussion and pledging our full commitment
to supporting Haiti in all issues related to the promotion
of human rights and, of course, issues close to my
heart - gender equality and women's empowerment.
We will continue working with the Government,
independent of the decision of the Security Council
on options for the future, and will continue to pursue
the possibility of a stand-alone office, where we can
support the recommendations of the Secretary-General
and the Security Council.
