The President: I thank Mr. Ould Cheikh Ahmed
not only for his briefing but for the tireless work that
he and his team are putting in, as well as for the risks
he is taking in travelling to Yemen and investing all his
efforts in trying to bring about a political solution.

I now give the floor to Mr. Al Hussein.
