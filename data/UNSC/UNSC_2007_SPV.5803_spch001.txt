The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
operation in Cyprus, document S/2007/699. Members
of the Council also have before them document

resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
