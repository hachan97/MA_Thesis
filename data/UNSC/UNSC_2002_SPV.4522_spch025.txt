The President (spoke in Russian): I will not read
my statement in my capacity as the representative of
the Russian Federation. I hope that our East Timorese
friends will understand me correctly. I fully associate
myself with all the kind words addressed to them here,
and with the words of gratitude to the Secretary-
General, Hedi Annabi, Sergio Vieira de Mello and
Kamalesh Sharma.

I also associate myself with the assessments
contained in the Secretary-General's report, which the
members of the Council have also expressed. We are
ready to work actively on those recommendations in
order to adopt the draft resolution on the new Mission
so that the United Nations can continue to support East
Timor following independence.

Given the lateness of the hour and commitments
that I cannot cancel, I wish to propose the following. In
the light of the requests made by some of the Council
members on my list and in the light of the fact that His
Excellency Xanana Gusmao must leave us very soon, I
propose that he make a few comments in response.
When he has finished, I will have to leave the
Chamber. If the members of the Council agree, then
Minister Konuzin can continue to chair the meeting
until 1.30 pm.

I call on the President-elect of East Timor,
Mr. Gusmao.
