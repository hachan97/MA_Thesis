Mrs. Perceval (Argentina): The delegation of
Argentina believes that there is not much sense
in making declarations about future events and
hypothetical consequences. However, we voted for
the draft resolution contained in document S/2014/189
because it reasserts the primacy of the principle of
territorial integrity. We did so in the hope that the draft
resolution could contribute to promoting constructive
dialogue in Ukraine and a search for solutions through
peaceful means and which includes all political and
social actors who today disagree.

We trust that all the parties in Ukraine will refrain
from unilateral action that could hamper dialogue or
obviate opportunities for a peaceful and negotiated
solution. We believe that it is for the Ukrainians to
manage their internal affairs and to interpret those
actions.

It is not for the Security Council to define this
situation. Our responsibility is to maintain international
peace and security. We therefore hope that all countries
will respect the principle of non-interference in internal
affairs and uphold their commitment to act strictly in
compliance with international law and the Charter
of the United Nations, with the goal of achieving a
peaceful solution in the country.
