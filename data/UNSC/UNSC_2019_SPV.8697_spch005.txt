Mr. Aljarallah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): We
regret that the Security Council was unable to adopt draft
resolution S/2019/961, presented by the humanitarian
troika, which was exclusively humanitarian in nature,
in order to renew the mechanism for the delivery of
humanitarian assistance across Syria's borders. We
hope that negotiations can continue on the renewal of
the mechanism, because there is no alternative to it and
4 million people depend on it.

In conclusion, given that this is the last meeting
that the State of Kuwait will be participating in for its
term on the Security Council, we would like to express
our appreciation to all the members of the Council
for their collaboration with us for the last two years
in our efforts to ensure that we are shouldering our
responsibility to help maintain international peace
and security We also wish every success to the five
incoming members - Estonia, Niger, Tunisia, Saint
Vincent and the Grenadines and Viet Nam - elected to
a two-year term of office on the Council.
