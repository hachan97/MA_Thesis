Mr. Heusgen (Germany): First, I wish very briefly
to thank both Commanders for their responses to the
questions, their level of detail and their commitment to
their tasks, as reflected in their answers.

I want briefly to come back to the African
Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur
(UNAMID). I am somewhat afraid that we are too
much on autopilot with respect to the drawdown of
UNAMID. From what I heard about the challenges that
the Force Commander faces, we are aware that he and
his troops are able to handle most ofthose, but they are
still challenges.

From my perspective, the most important of these
was perhaps not sufficiently highlighted, and that
is the fact that we now have a new environment in
Khartoum. The Transitional Military Council is now
in control, and the strongman General Hamdan is the
head of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). They have
decided that the Rapid Support Forces should take
over the sites where UNAMID is stationed. I believe
that we cannot accept that. We fully support what the
Force Commander is planning with regard to the team
sites being taken over by universities, hospitals or civil
society. But to have them as outposts of the Rapid
Support Forces, which were responsible for what is
now being called the "Khartoum massacre" on 3 June,
is unacceptable. We cannot accept that the UNAMID
team sites will in future be the sites ofthe RSF, which is
the follow-up organization to the Janjaweed, who were
co-responsible for the outbreak of the Darfur conflict
from the very beginning.

The meeting rose at 12.35 pm.
