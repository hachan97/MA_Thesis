Mr. Al-Kidwa (Palestine) (spoke in Arabic): What
has happened today in their Chamber is very regrettable.
The inability of the Security Council to take a firm stand
on a matter of strategic importance - namely, the
expansionist separation wall - is very alarming in the
context of the fate of the region and the possibilities of
achieving a Palestinian-Israeli peace. Consequently, we
must urgently find a way to redress what has taken place
within the framework of the United Nations system. Of
course, with the help of our friends, we will try to do
just that.

Regardless of the outcome, we would like to
express our thanks to the sponsors of the draft
resolution that was voted on today, as well as to all the
members of the Council who voted in its favour. They
have indeed voted for peace.
