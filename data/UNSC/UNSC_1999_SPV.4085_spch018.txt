The President: I shall now make a brief statement
in my capacity as the representative of the United
Kingdom.

 

The United Kingdom very much shares the consensus
of views around this table about the progress that has been
made in East Timor and endorses the tributes that have
been paid to those responsible for that progress. We also
share the continued concern, particularly about the plight of
refugees, in East and West Timor, and about accountability
for human rights abuses.

Let me just say a word about the Tokyo donor
conference, the results of which we very much welcome.
This was an important contribution to the reconstruction of
East Timor and to its smooth transition to independence. It
is all the more welcome because the United Nations and the
World Bank do not always cooperate so well together.

The United Kingdom pledged some $20 million over
the three-year period to come. Although that is rather less
than our commitment, for instance, to Sierra Leone, it is
still a substantial sum. The funds will be channelled to
UNTAET and to the World Bank trust funds, according to
evolving needs. We need to be certain that these funds are
used to ensure a simple, flexible and sensitive approach to
East Timor's requirements which is well coordinated by
UNTAET and by the World Bank. Disjointed bilateral
approaches would risk overwhelming East Timorese
capacity, so we want to underline this need for proper
coordination of the most welcome funding that is now
available.

I resume my functions as President of the Security
Council.

I call on Mr. Annabi to respond to the comments and
questions that have been raised.
