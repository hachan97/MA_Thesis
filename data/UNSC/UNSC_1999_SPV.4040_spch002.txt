Mr. Stephanides (Officer-in-Charge of the Security Council Affairs Division): The draft annual report of the
Security Council for the period 16 June 1998 to 15 June
1999, to be submitted to the General Assembly of the
United Nations in pursuance of Article 24, paragraph 3, and
Article 15, paragraph 1, of the United Nations
Charter, has been prepared by the Secretariat in line with
the revised format agreed upon by the Security Council in
1974 and further revised in 1985, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997
and 1998.

The format of the draft report before the Council
provides a guide to the activities of the Council in a
concise manner. It should be noted that, in addition to the
extensive coverage provided in part V on the work of the
subsidiary organs of the Council, the annual reports of the
sanctions Committees are to be found in appendix XII of
the report, in accordance with the note by the President of
the Security Council of 30 October 1998, document
S/ 1998/ 1016. Further, the monthly assessments of the
work of the Council by former Presidents for the period
covered by the report have been expanded to include
statements to the press made by the President following
consultations of the whole of the Council. Such
statements have been annexed to the assessments by the
former Presidents at their discretion, pursuant to the
understanding reached in the Council's consultations of
the whole on 30 November 1998.

The draft report was circulated by the Assistant
Secretary-General for Political Affairs on 25 August 1999
to the current members of the Security Council and to the
members whose terms of office expired on 31 December
1998, namely, Costa Rica, Japan, Kenya, Portugal and
Sweden, for review and comments, if any. A consolidated
corrigendum containing those changes proposed by
Council members or made by the Secretariat is also
before the Council.
