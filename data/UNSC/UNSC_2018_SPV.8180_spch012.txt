Mr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish):
I take the floor briefly once again, in my national
capacity, to associate myself with my colleagues who
have acknowledged the importance of convening this
meeting in accordance with resolution 2341 (2017), on
protecting critical infrastructure from terrorist attacks.
Peru welcomes and supports the efforts of the United
Nations and the Security Council in that important
area, including the establishment of a specific Counter-
Terrorism Implementation Task Force.

We consider it of the utmost importance to
evaluate the efforts of Member States to protect their
infrastructure against terrorist acts, as well as to
develop preventive measures within the framework
of their national strategies and policies. We also
believe it is important to work on rebuilding damaged
infrastructure. In our experience, that is key to
effectively fight terrorism and build sustainable peace.

We would like to recall, that between 1980 and
1992 - the worst years of terrorism suffered in
Peru - the economic damages amounted to more
than $20 billion. To put that number into context: the
gross domestic product of Peru stood at $36 billion,
while poverty exceeded 60 per cent of the population.
Peruvians have now closed that sad chapter, with the
economy having grown substantially, to almost eight
times what it was at that time, and poverty having been
reduced to 20 per cent. However, the lesson that we as
Peruvians have learned from those dark times is that we
must always remain vigilant over terrorism and never
let our guard down.
