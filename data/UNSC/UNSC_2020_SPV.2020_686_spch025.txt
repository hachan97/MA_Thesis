I wish to thank you, Mr. President, for allowing this right of reply. I will make it brief despite the fact that the Libyan representative was fairly lengthy in his accusations against, I think, almost every constructive player in the international community. We regret that, given the constructive nature of this meeting under your leadership, an attempt was made by the representative of Libya to undermine it. My Minister, Mr. Gargash, outlined earlier in his statement the fact that the United Arab Emirates has consistently supported a comprehensive and lasting political solution to the Libyan crisis and that its efforts have always been in accordance with the principles of international law, the Charter of the United Nations and Security Council resolutions, and we continue to support the tireless efforts of the United Nations to work with the parties to reach a ceasefire and resume a political process. I feel that I must say this again here for the record because of the accusations that were levelled at my country. Yes, the solution must come from the Libyan people, but that includes all of the Libyan people, not a select few. Progress in Libya will necessarily involve a difficult compromise by all parties in Libya and a recognition that any hopes for a military victory are illusory. We reaffirm our commitment to Libya and the outcomes of the Berlin Conference, and we urge others to make the same commitment here today because - and I was asked why my country has an interest of being at this table - ensuring Libya's long-term peace and stability is a core interest for peace and security in the international community at large.
