Mr. Zhao Yong (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
voted in favour of resolution 2244 (2015), which the
Security Council just adopted. Since the beginning
of this year, the Federal Government of Somalia, with
the vigorous support of the international community,
has been dedicated to the implementation of Vision
2016, actively safeguarded State security, promoted
economic development and improved the people's
living standards, which China greatly appreciates.
We hope that resolution 2244 (2015) can be fully
and accurately implemented, and that it will play a
genuinely constructive role in promoting the peaceful
reconstruction of Somalia and safeguarding regional
peace and stability.

The final report (S/2015/802) of the Monitoring
Group under the Somalia and Eritrea Sanctions
Committee indicated that no evidence had been found
showing Eritrean Government support for Al-Shabaab.
In view of changes in the situation, the Security Council
should make corresponding adjustments to the relevant
sanctions measures so as to create conditions for the
eventual lifting of the sanctions.

China has always supported Africa in resolving
African issues in an African way and has encouraged the
relevant countries of the region to appropriately resolve
their differences through dialogue and consultation
and to jointly work for regional peace, stability and
development.
