Mr. Jingree (Mauritius): We, too, welcome
Deputy President Zuma to this Chamber today and
thank him for coming all the way to New York to brief
us on the Burundi peace process. At the same time, we
also welcome the new Permanent Representative of
France.
My delegation would like to congratulate the
Government of South Africa for its very constructive
role in the quest for peace, not only in Burundi but in
the whole Great Lakes region. We would like to
commend Deputy President Zuma for the personal
efforts he deployed in trying to encourage the
Burundian parties to reach a ceasefire agreement. We
also are grateful to President Mandela for his
contribution to the Burundi peace process.

Like other delegations, we welcome the ceasefire
agreement that was signed between the National
Council for the Defence of Democracy-Forces for the
Defence of Democracy (CNDD-FDD) and the
Transitional Government this week. This leads us to
believe that there is no justification for the National
Liberation Forces (FNL) to remain outside the peace
process. In this respect, we hope that the FNL joins the
peace process before the end of the year, and we should
therefore keep the pressure on them.

In spite of the efforts being deployed by the
Transitional Government, the serious economic
constraints faced by Burundi is creating a difficult
situation in which the Burundian population is not
seeing a real dividend of peace. We recognize that
some of the funds pledged by international donors have
been disbursed to help the Transitional Government. In
the same vein, we would appeal to the international
community to assist Burundi in alleviating this
situation, so that its people can see the dividends of
peace.

Finally, my delegation fully shares the optimism
expressed by Deputy President Zuma and would like to
assure him of our full support.
