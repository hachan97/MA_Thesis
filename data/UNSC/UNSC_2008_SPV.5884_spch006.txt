Mr. Ripert (France) (spoke in French): With the
adoption of resolutions 1754 (2007) and 1783 (2007),
the international community unanimously welcomed
the end of the stalemate on Western Sahara, with the
commencement of negotiations without preconditions
and in good faith. The lack of progress in the
Manhasset negotiations undermines the search for a
mutually acceptable, just and lasting political solution
negotiated under United Nations auspices, allowing for
the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.
The continuation of the status quo in Western Sahara is
an obstacle to building an integrated, prosperous
Maghreb and poses a threat to the stability of the entire
region.

By resolutions 1754 (2007) and 1783 (2007), the
Security Council unanimously welcomed the serious
and credible Moroccan efforts to produce an autonomy
plan for Western Sahara. That, of course, is not a sine
qua non: the autonomy plan proposed by Morocco
forms the basis for serious and constructive negotiation
aimed at a negotiated settlement between the parties,
with respect for the principle of self-determination, to
which we are committed.

We have taken note with interest of the
assessment of the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-
General, which supplements the information set out in
the report of the Secretary-General (S/2008/25l). We
pay tribute once again to Secretary-General and his
Personal Envoy for their efforts to resolve the question
of Western Sahara.

In adopting the present resolution, the Security
Council calls upon the parties to display realism and a
spirit of compromise so that the negotiations can move
to a stage of greater intensity and substance. We hope
that the Security Council and all Member States - in
particular, neighbouring countries in the region - will
remain ready to support the ongoing negotiations, as
called for in resolutions 1754 (2007) and 1783 (2007)
and in the present resolution.
