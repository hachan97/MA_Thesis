The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Mr. Brammertz for his briefing.

On behalf of all the members of the Security
Council, I would like to express our profound gratitude
to the three briefers for their participation in this
meeting and for their detailed, useful and informative
reports. We also thank and commend them for their
excellent work.

Before giving the floor to the members of the
Security Council and the representatives of other
States, I should like to remind all speakers to limit their
statements, to the extent possible, to a maximum of
five minutes in order to allow the Security Council to
complete its work expeditiously. In that regard, I take
this opportunity to remind speakers that the presidency
shall activate the light on their microphone in order to
encourage them to complete their remarks. Delegations
wishing to make extensive statements should kindly
distribute them in writing and to deliver abbreviated
versions in the Chamber.

I now give the floor to members of the Council.
