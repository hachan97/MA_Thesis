Mr. Dang (Viet Nam): Viet Nam welcomes the Agreement for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan between the United States of America and the Taliban and the Joint Declaration between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the United States of America for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan. We thank the United States, the Government of Afghanistan and other parties for their efforts. We commend the Government of Qatar for having hosted the diplomatic talks, and thank the co-penholders, Germany and Indonesia, for their engagement and contributions to preparing the text of resolution 2513 (2020). Give the historic momentum created by the Agreement, but also the fragile situation on the ground, Viet Nam believes that the Security Council should seize the opportunity to act. We therefore voted in favour of resolution 2513 (2020). We very much hope that momentum of today will contribute to long-term peace and stability in Afghanistan and benefit its people. We are extremely pleased to see the unified position of the Security Council, which will send a very strong and positive message to all parties in Afghanistan and to its people. We stand ready to assist the Afghan people as they endeavour for peace, stability and development.
