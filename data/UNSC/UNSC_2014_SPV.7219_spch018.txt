The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as the representative of Rwanda.

I thank Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, Under-Secretary-
General for Political Affairs, for his availability and for
his detailed briefing, prepared on such short notice.

Allow me, first of all, to express my deep sorrow
over the loss of the 298 lives, including 80 children,
who were killed on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-l7,
which was shot down in eastern Ukraine. On behalf
of the Government of Rwanda, I express my deepest
condolences to the families who lost loved ones,
as well as to the people and the Governments of the
victims. The loss of those innocent civilians is beyond
comprehension. Their lives were cut off in the middle
of a crisis on which this very Council has been unable
to take action since it began in February.

With the shooting down of a civilian airplane
carrying civilians, the Ukrainian crisis is no longer
a conflict between the Ukrainian military and armed
separatists. The conflict has crossed a red line by
endangering all our lives, as if did in the case of the
men, women and children from different countries who
were aboard Flight MH-l7. We condemn in the strongest
terms this reckless attack and call for a comprehensive,
independent, international investigation in accordance
with international guidelines, as agreed in the press
statement adopted this morning. Such an investigaton
should establish responsibility so that the perpetrators
can be held accountable. In that context, we further
urge all parties to cease fire, to fully cooperate with
the investigation and to grant unhindered access to the
crash site in order to allow international investigators
to carry out their work.

We note that yesterday's criminal act follows the
downing of a Ukrainian fighter jet on Wednesday and
that of a military cargo plane on Monday. The frequent
use of surface-to-air missiles during the past few
months raises the question of access to such weapons,
which, as we have now seen, are capable of downing a
civilian airplane flying at over 30,000 feet. Therefore,
the Security Council and the broader international
community can no longer afford to turn a blind eye on
the matter.

It is unfortunate that this tragic event comes at

a time when national and regional efforts are under
way to find a political and diplomatic solution to
the Ukrainian crisis. This act undermines valuable
initiatives of the trilateral contact group of senior
representatives of Ukraine, the Russian Federation
and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, who were making all necessary efforts for a
resumption of consultations with separatists in eastern
Ukraine. On Tuesday, the group reconfirmed its support
for President Petro Poroshenko's peace plan, as well as
its commitment to a sustainable ceasefire, as stated in
the joint declaration issued in Berlin on 2 July by the
Foreign Ministers of Germany, France, the Russian
Federation and Ukraine.

In conclusion, let me renew our call to the armed
groups to respect the unity, sovereignty and territorial
integrity okaraine. They must lay down their weapons
and engage in constructive dialogue with the Ukrainian
Government. In the same vein, we urge all parties to
immediately cease fire and support the ongoing efforts
to de-escalate the crisis and bring peace to Ukraine and
the region.

The shooting down of a civilian plane in the midst
of the conflict in eastern Ukraine is a stark reminder of
the moral responsibility of Security Council members
to set aside their divisions on this crisis, to hold the
perpetrators of this criminal act to account and to
uphold their mandate to maintain international peace
and security.

The President: I now resume my functions as
President of the Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Ukraine.
