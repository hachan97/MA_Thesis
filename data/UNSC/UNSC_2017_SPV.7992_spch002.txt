Mr. Bessho (Japan): Japan would like to express its
high respect for Bolivia's tenacious efforts. We value the
fact that Security Council members have been able to
discuss this important matter seriously and extensively.
Resolution 2365 (2017), adopted unanimously today,
clearly recognizes that the growing threat posed by
landmines, explosive remnants of war and improvised
explosive devices undermines international peace and
stability. I hope that it will provide additional guidance
to stakeholders, including Member States, to allow
them to move forward.

Japan has long placed mine-action assistance among
its top diplomatic priorities. On 28 June, Japan signed
an exchange note with Colombia, providing $9 million
of grant aid in support of the Government's demining
efforts through equipment and technical expertise.
Japan is determined to continue to play a leading role in
mine action, in collaboration with other stakeholders,
and sincerely hopes that resolution 2365 (2017), which
Japan co-sponsored, can, along with other international
instruments, contribute to our primary goal, namely, to
realize a landmine-free world.
