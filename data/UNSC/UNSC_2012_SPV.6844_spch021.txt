Mr. Cabral (Portugal): At the outset, allow me to
thank the President and the Prosecutor of the Special
Court for Sierra Leone for their comprehensive briefings
today. I would also like to welcome and to thank the
Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sierra Leone for
her statement.

We fully agree with the preceding interventions,
which have highlighted the important role that the Special
Court has played in providing justice and in fighting
impunity. In the spirit of note 507 by the President on
the Council's working methods (S/2010/507) and in
order to avoid repeating contents, I will spare members
the delivery of yet another statement. Our full statement
is being circulated.

Allow me, however, to thank the President and the
Prosecutor of the Special Court for Sierra Leone for their
efforts. I would also like to thank all those who work or
have worked with the Court in ensuring that the mission
entrusted to it will come to a successful end very soon.
