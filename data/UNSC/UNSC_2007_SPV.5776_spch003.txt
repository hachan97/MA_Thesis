The President: I thank the Secretary-General for
his statement.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers
to limit their statements to no more than five minutes,
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate the text in writing in the
Chamber and to deliver condensed versions when
speaking.
