Mr. Van Oosterom (Netherlands): As this is my
first public meeting here this month, please allow me
to honour your presidency, Sir, by trying to say this
in Chinese.

(spoke in Chinese)
Thank you, Mr. President.
(spoke in English)

First of all, let me take this opportunity to thank the
United Kingdom for its diligent efforts in coordinating
the drafting of resolution 2441 (2018). In our opinion,
the Libya sanctions regime is a crucial element of the
Council's efforts to support peace and stability in Libya.
We welcome the fact that today's resolution extends the
regime, including the mandate ofthe Panel of Experts of
the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1970
(2011), by another 15 months. We welcome in particular
the addition of a new sanctions criterion for sexual
and gender-based violence, pursuant to a proposal
made by Sweden and us. Sexual and gender-based
violence, particularly against migrants, constitutes an
increasingly worrying problem in Libya that requires a
strong response. The issue of sexual Violence in Libya
is directly connected to the issues ofpeace and security
in Libya that we are discussing here today. The addition
of this designation criterion is an important step
towards addressing the issue. The need for it was also
underlined by many during the Arria Formula meeting
on the issue on 22 October, not only in regard to Libya
but across the Council's sanctions regimes and beyond.

This year the Committee put sanctions in place
against seven specific individuals. Six of them concern
the first-ever sanctions on human traffickers. They
were proposed by the Kingdom of the Netherlands and
partners inside and outside the Council. Ensuring the
implementation of these and all sanctions is key. We
therefore draw the attention of all Member States to
the Council's call in this resolution to implement the
travel ban and the assets-freeze measures against those
individuals and to report to the Committee on the steps
they have taken.
