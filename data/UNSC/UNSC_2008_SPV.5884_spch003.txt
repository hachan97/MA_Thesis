Mr. Safronkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I would like to express our surprise at the
fact that in his statement the representative of Costa
Rica - which normally has friendly relations with the
Russian Federation - distorted the thrust of the
discussion held in the framework of the consultations
in the Security Council. Our Ambassador put forward
arguments of a totally different nature with regard to
the technical veto. They dealt with the situation of
putting to the vote a draft resolution on which there
was no agreement from our capital. I wish to add that
3
other delegations spoke against the inclusion of these
amendments to the text of the resolution for the same
reasons.
