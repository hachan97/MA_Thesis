Mr. Jagne (Gambia): Let me begin by thanking the
sponsors for the great effort that was put into the draft
resolution before us and, indeed, for the high degree of
flexibility that they have demonstrated throughout, in
reaction to various proposals and counter-proposals, to
arrive at a consensus.

The early adoption of this draft resolution is a clear
indication of our collective endeavour to respond urgently
at all times to the humanitarian needs of the people of Iraq.

With the adoption of the draft resolution, the green
light is thus given for the purchase of the spare parts that
would enable Iraq to pump more oil in sufficient quantities
to meet the shortfall in order to arrive at the total sum of
$5 billion - $5.256 billion, to be more precise.

The oil-for-food programme, which is designed
specifically to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people,
has, to a large extent, been functioning smoothly and,
contrary to growing fears in some quarters, the programme
is conceived as a temporary measure.

My delegation is convinced that, with the approval of
the distribution plan already submitted by Iraq, the
subsequent approval for the purchase of the necessary spare
parts and other equipment will go a long way towards
improving even further the overall humanitarian situation in
Iraq. Furthermore, there is provision for the periodic review
of the plan for possible amendment, if and when
necessary, in conformity with Council resolution 1153 (1998).

The exemplary cooperation between Iraq and the
United Nations on the oil-for-food programme is very
healthy, generally speaking. Consequently, my delegation
will vote in favour of the draft resolution before us.
