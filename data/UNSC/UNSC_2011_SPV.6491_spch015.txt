Mr. Moungara Moussotsi (Gabon) (spoke in French): The situation in Libya for almost two weeks
required an answer and a clear and strong message
from the Security Council, in accordance with the
responsibility entrusted to it by the Charter of our
Organization. That is why Gabon has voted with the
other members of the Council, not only to condemn the
killing of peaceful demonstrators but to make the
Libyan regime aware of the consequences of such
actions.

Gabon is ready to associate itself with other
measures that the international community may adopt
to protect innocent lives in Libya and to ensure the
legitimate rights of the Libyan people to free speech
and peace in their country.
