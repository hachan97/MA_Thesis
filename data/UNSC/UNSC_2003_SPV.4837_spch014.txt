Mr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): Spain
would like to thank the High Representative for his
outstanding work in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and
particularly for his comprehensive briefing to the
Security Council. We would also like to thank Judge
Meron for his work at the helm of the International
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and for his
very interesting briefing.

The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina requires,
as the High Representative just mentioned, two
different kinds of measures in order to move forward.
One is to reform the State, in order to strengthen
institutions and ensure that the rule of law is firmly
established, and the other is to restructure the economy
to remove obstacles to development and the generation
of jobs. No one is unaware that the ultimate goal of
those measures is Bosnia and Herzegovina's attainment
of political and economic levels commensurate with
those of other European countries.

With regard to the first set of measures, my
country is following with particular attention the
restructuring of the armed forces and the Ministry of
Defence. In that connection, I would like to ask Lord
Ashdown whether he believes that the recent reforms
described in his report, if strengthened, will make it
possible for Bosnia and Herzegovina to become part of
NATO's Partnership for Peace in the near future. In
addition, in connection with the outcome of the
meeting of Ministers of Defence of the European
Union, Spain would like to hear the views of the High
Representative regarding what would be the best
conditions on the ground in the event that the European
Union replaces NATO's mission in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.

Lastly, I have a brief comment regarding justice.
There can be no doubt that the only way to strengthen
peace is to render justice. We commend the work done
by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia, as well as the establishment of a War
Crimes Chamber.
