Mr. Radomski (Poland): Poland welcomes the
adoption of resolution 2410 (2018) extending the mandate
of the United Nations Mission for Justice Support in
Haiti (MINUJUSTH). However, it is unfortunate that
we were not able to maintain the good practice ofhaving
an anonymous adoption of a resolution that technically
rolls over the mandate. Poland voted in favour of the
resolution, hoping for the unity of the Council.

Another division of the Council sends a negative
message to a place that needs positive signals now, as
it is right in the middle of the process of transition. It
is time not to point fingers, but rather to find a way to
avoid such a situation in the future for the sake of the
Council's credibility and efficiency.

Let me conclude with expressing once again our
satisfaction with the progress made by the Haitian
Government and its people in building a better future
for their country. We believe that further presence of
MINUJUSTH will support those efforts.
