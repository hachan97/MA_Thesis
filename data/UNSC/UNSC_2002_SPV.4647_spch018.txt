The President (spoke in Chinese): I should now
like to make a statement in my capacity as the
representative of China.

First of all, I should like to thank Under-
Secretary-General Prendergast for his briefing. Since
the deliberations of the Security Council in August this
year, the peace process in Bougainville has, with the
cooperation of the new Government of Papua New
Guinea, been steadily moving forward, and China is
gratified by that. We hope that all sides will continue to
take a positive and flexible position and advance the
process of the eventual peaceful settlement of the
Bougainville question. All sides are comprehensively
implementing the relevant provisions of the
Bougainville Peace Agreement. On the whole,
significant progress has been achieved with regard to
weapons collection, although some problems have
cropped up in this work. Whether or not that task can
continue to be carried out smoothly will have a great
impact on the peace process.

The United Nations Political Office in
Bougainville (UNPOB) has always played an important
role in weapons collection. It has also won the trust of
all sides. At the moment, the collection work has not
been completed and the peace process is at a crucial
point. In view of this, China supports full consideration
of the request made by the parties concerned. We
support the extension of the mandate of UNPOB for
one year so that the Political Office can continue to
play its proper role in the peace process. Over a long
period, the Political Office, under the leadership of
Ambassador Sinclair, has done very effective work.
China wishes to express its appreciation for that and
we will, as in the past, support the efforts of the Office
in this regard.

I resume my functions as President of the
Council.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Papua New Guinea, on whom I now
call.
