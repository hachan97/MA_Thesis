Ms. Sison (United States of America): I thank
Special Representative Organizationf the Secretary-
General Kubis him for his briefing and want to commend
him and his team for all of their efforts and operating
under such difficult circumstances. I also thank the
Ambassador of Iraq for his briefing this morning.

I wanted to comment on just one aspect of the
intervention made by the Russian delegation. Ofcourse,
we all recognize that the terrorism of the Islamic State
in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) remains a determined and
pernicious enemy in Iraq. Nearly every day, we hear
of ISIL bombings in civilian areas, resulting in high
numbers of casualties. The United States is a committed
partner of the Iraqi Government, of the Iraqi people
and, indeed, of the United Nations Assistance Mission
for Iraq. Vice-President Biden strongly reaffirmed his
own commitment during his recent visit to Iraq last
week.

We are encouraged by the recent military progress
in Anbar with the liberation of Hit and the breaking of
the siege of Haditha.

But I want to note that it is important that we work
together as a Council on a consensus-based appraoch.
We welcome cooperation among Council members so
that we can look for a constructive way to orient our
work. For example, we worked together on the chemical
weapons portfolio in Syria, adopting a number of very
important resolutions - resolutions 2118 (2013), 2209
(2015) and 2235 (2015). We regard that success as the
result of our joint productive work at the Council. I think
those resolutions have removed significant amount of
chemicals weapons. The resolutions condemned the
use of chlorine gas as a weapon and established the
Joint Investigative Mechanism. We want to keep the
Mechanism focused on the use of chemical weapons by
any actors in Syria.

As we look at the challenges posed by terrorism
in Iraq, including the use of any such weapons by any
actors, we want to look towards a constructive way of
focusing on a consensus-based approach.
