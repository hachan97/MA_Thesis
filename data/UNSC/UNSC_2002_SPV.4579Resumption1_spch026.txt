Mr. Brahimi: It has been a long day for the
Council, and I shall be very brief. I should just like to
reiterate the expression of my appreciation, thanks and
gratitude to all those who participated in this debate.
Their statements confirm the international community's
continued interest in supporting Afghanistan, and that
is something we very much welcome.

It was a great pleasure to see Mrs. Ogata, a
frequent visitor to several areas of Afghanistan, a high-
ranking international official and now a distinguished
representative of her country. Her statement very much
reflected her Government's strong interest, and her
own strong interest, in Afghanistan.

Again, I am grateful to the representatives of
neighbours of Afghanistan and other countries in the
region for together realizing the importance of helping
to reinforce peace and security in Afghanistan. I
believe that they now share our view that the conflict in
Afghanistan, if it continues, will not be confined within
that country's borders. By the same token, I think that
peace, if it is established and reinforced in
Afghanistan, will spread its benefits to the
neighbouring countries and beyond in the region.

I should like to assure the Council that, under the
guidance of the Secretary-General, the United Nations
Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) and the
United Nations will continue to serve the people of
Afghanistan to the best of our ability. We think that the
Afghan people deserve that help, that interest and that
support, and we count on the Council and its
members - as well as on all Members of the United
Nations - to stay the course and to do what it takes to
bring Afghanistan to the point of no return from peace
to conflict.
