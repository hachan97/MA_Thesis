Mr. De La Sabliere (France) (spoke in French):
Somalia, which has for 15 years been marked by
violence and suffering, finds itself today at a turning
point in its history.

France voted in favour of the resolution that has
just been adopted, because we support the efforts of the
African Union to help Somalia to return to the path of
peace and stability. The deployment of the African
Union Military Observer Mission in Somalia is a
source of great hope for the Somali people, as it is for
the Horn of Africa and the entire continent.

France nevertheless believes that, however great
its determination and the efforts it has made, the
international community cannot impose peace in
Somalia. It is up to Somalis alone to seize the unique
opportunity offered by the African Union to embark
upon and strengthen a process of national
reconciliation. We hope that they will be able to seize
that opportunity, for the future of Somalia is in their
hands.
