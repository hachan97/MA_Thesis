The President (spoke in Chinese): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2011/l42, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by France, Lebanon, the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and the United States of America.

I wish to welcome the presence at this meeting of
the Deputy Secretary-General, Her Excellency
Mrs. Asha-Rose Migiro.

I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Alain Juppe on
his assumption of the office of Minister for Foreign
Affairs of France. In my capacity as President of the
Council, I would like to extend, on behalf of the
Council, a warm welcome to Mr. Juppe and to thank
him for his participation in today's meeting.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.

I shall now give the floor to those members who
wish to make statements before the voting.
