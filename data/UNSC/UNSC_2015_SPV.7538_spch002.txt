Mr. Van Bohemen (New Zealand): I would like to
express our gratitude to all the members of the Security
Council for their contributions, support and comments and
for the confidence they placed in New Zealand during the
process of preparing this report.

At the request of Council members, this year we
revised the approach that had been taken to the preparation
of the report, in particular by providing an introduction that
is half the length of the introductions in recent years. The
introduction attempts to provide an accessible summary
of the Council's activities. That was quite an intensive
process, which took place over nearly three months.

At the same time, we acknowledge that negotiations
have continued in the Working Group on documentation
and procedure on the best approach to the report in the
future. We support the efforts being led by Lithuania and
the Russian Federation in that regard.

We also knowledge those States Members of the
United Nations that have called for transparency in
the work of the Council and have expressed interest in
increasing the quality of the dialogue with the Assembly,
including through improvements in the introduction to
the report. We recognize that what we have done this year
will not go as far as some would wish. We too would have
preferred a document that contained more self-reflection
on the Council's performance. However, by its nature, this
report is a Council document and requires the support of
all Council members.
