Mr. Brahimi (spoke in French): I should like to
say how pleased I am, and what an honour it is for me,
to take the floor under your presidency, Sir.

(spoke in English)

The Council has before it a report of the
Secretary-General that outlines all the major
developments since last July. My briefing will
therefore focus on a few key issues, in particular those
which have arisen since I last had the privilege of
appearing before the Council, on 19 September.

As members of the Council know, security
remains a priority concern for the people of
Afghanistan. Sporadic fighting continues to erupt from
time to time, particularly in the north, the south-east
and, to a lesser extent, the west. The Government does
not yet have the means to deal in an effective manner
with the underlying problems which are the cause of
such threats to security. The Government, with the
support of the United Nations, can address only the
symptoms; like a fire brigade, the Government's and
our interventions aim to put out the local fires, rather
than to prevent their occurrence.

Once again, the factional leaders in the north -
Generals Abdul Rashid Dostum and Atta
Mohammad - have been brought together to control
those of their commanders who are responsible for the
repeated incidents of the past few weeks. The
Government has also intervened to stop the fighting
between Ismael Khan and Amanullah Khan in the west.
In the south-east, it was hoped that the forcible eviction
of Pahsha Khan Zadran would put an end to insecurity
in the region. This hope proved premature, however,
and clashes continue to occur there. We deplore the
heavy toll taken by all of these incidents - more than
50 deaths throughout the country and about the same
number of wounded, many of them civilians.

Just as deplorable as the clashes between armed
groups and the resultant loss of life are all the daily
abuses to which the civilian population is subjected in
many parts of the country, including Kabul. Speaking
at a seminar organized by the Supreme Court last week,
President Karzai expressed his frustration and that of
the people of Afghanistan in very strong terms, and
directed a blunt warning to those who were responsible
for the continuing insecurity in the country.

There will be no long-term solution to the
security problems of Afghanistan unless and until a
well-trained, well-equipped and regularly paid national
police force and national army are in place. With
Germany as the lead nation, work is proceeding well as
far as the national police is concerned. Things are
slower and more complicated with the national army.
The National Defence Commission had some useful
consultations in September and early October. But the
results that it has achieved so far remain unsatisfactory.
It is hoped that the Commission will resume its work
soon and produce a clear, credible and achievable plan
for the formation of the national army.
In our opinion, such a plan needs to include
several elements. First, the Ministry of Defence must
be reformed. Secondly, there must be a firm
commitment by all factional and regional leaders - all
of whom are members of the National Defence
Commission - to integrate their respective armies
within the national army through a process which
would lead to part of those armies being phased into
the national army and the rest being disarmed and
phased out. Thirdly, this would further require a
comprehensive demobilization and reintegration
programme to help current and former combatants to
return to a dignified civilian life. Lastly, the training
started by the United States, as lead nation, and by
France should be integrated within a comprehensive
national training programme, in close cooperation with
the Ministry of Defence.

It is encouraging that the Vice-President and
Minister of Defence Fahim Khan, as well as other
factional leaders, have repeatedly expressed their
commitment to these principles. It is hoped that the
necessary financial resources will be made available by
donors to support the formation of the national police
and the national army. Of course, the formation of a
national police and a national army will take time. But
if both programmes are firmly on track, the peace
process will be consolidated and security very
significantly improved long before the last policeman
and the last soldier have been trained.

In the meantime, I can only repeat what the
Secretary-General and I have said consistently since
the Bonn Conference: the Government and the people
of Afghanistan need, and are asking for, international
support to provide security while the national police
and national army are being trained.

A drafting committee to prepare the new
constitution has been formed, and was announced by
the Government one month later than called for in the
Bonn Agreement. That delay will not affect the
schedule of work, as the draft constitution will be
submitted to the Constitutional Loya Jirga only at the
end of next year. The committee has started its work,
and the United Nations Assistance Mission in
Afghanistan (UNAMA) is providing support as
mandated by the Bonn Agreement.

At the Supreme Court seminar on 24 October,
President Karzai also said that he would formally
announce the creation of a new judicial commission
this week. Considerable time has been lost in this
regard as the earlier commission was recognized as
being insufficiently independent. There is substantial
and very welcome interest in the international
community for both the constitutional and judicial
reform processes. Promises have been made to provide
generous financial support to both commissions. The
Government of Italy, as the lead nation for judicial
reform, has already provided some funds to support the
establishment of the judicial commission. We very
much hope that additional funds will be made available
soon to support the vast needs for judicial reform, as
well as the constitutional process. We at UNAMA look
forward to a well-coordinated international effort to
support those processes, on the clear understanding
that, in those fields even more than in others, success
requires strong national ownership and leadership.

Despite gradual progress in some areas, the
human rights situation remains worrisome in many
respects. Underlying causes of the situation include the
lack of security and the weakness of the central
Government, warlordism, persistent factional conflicts
in some parts of the country and a very basic and
dysfunctional justice system.

Harassment, intimidation and other abuses
against the Pashtun ethnic group in the North have
receded somewhat in the last month or two, but in
many of the northern districts, Pashtun internally
displaced persons who were obliged to flee their
villages are not yet able to return home. This is
particularly the case in the provinces of Faryab, Sar-e
P01 and Jowzjan. On 17 October, the Ministry of
Refugees and Repatriation, the Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
and UNAMA agreed on the establishment of a Return
Commission for the North to help overcome those
problems.

I should note, however, that those problems
transcend human rights and humanitarian concerns and
threaten to have an adverse impact on the peace
process itself. It is imperative for the Transitional
Government and other forces committed to the
reconstruction of the country to strengthen the idea that
Afghanistan belongs to all of its citizens, regardless of
their ethnic origin or political affiliation.
Unfortunately, at present, local commanders continue
to violate the rights of Afghans in remote rural areas,
with little or no response from any State law-
enforcement authority.

In spite of the progress made since the fall of the
Taliban regime, the situation of women continues to be
a matter of concern in many parts of the country. Local
authorities are apparently not intervening in serious
cases of domestic violence. Forced marriages are still a
frequent phenomenon, and exchanges of girls are
sometimes used as a dispute settlement tool between
families and factions. In order to improve its capacity
to identify significant trends on gender issues,
UNAMA has encouraged the establishment of data
collection through meetings of a gender network that
includes the Ministry of Women's Affairs, United
Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations.

On the highly publicized issue of gravesites in the
North, we are of the view that impartial investigations
should commence as soon as possible. UNAMA agrees
with the Afghan Independent Human Rights
Commission that the following steps should be taken.
First, a multi-site investigation should be undertaken,
reflecting a politically impartial approach. Secondly,
investigations should, at present, have the limited
objective of finding and preserving evidence. At this
stage, given the conflict-rich and volatile situation in
the North and the fact that we cannot provide effective
protection to witnesses, we cannot go beyond that
objective.

The Office of the High Commissioner for Human
Rights is negotiating on behalf of UNAMA with
experienced forensic teams to carry out the technical
aspects of the investigation into the gravesites that
have been identified. Regrettably, we are now receiving
answers from those forensic experts that it would be
difficult to start the investigations before next spring,
because of adverse weather conditions during the
winter months. We still believe that some preparatory
work could and should be done before the winter, at
least on the protection of the sites. It will be important
to convey our intention to proceed in an impartial
manner and to defuse the tensions caused by the
exclusive media focus on the gravesite at Dasht-e-
Leily.

On a positive note, the support project to the
Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission has
now become operative. Donors have shown significant
interest in contributing to the Commission, which will
soon be able to recruit additional staff and start
opening its regional offices throughout the country.
UNAMA and the Office of the High Commissioner for
Human Rights are facilitating the provision of
technical assistance and expertise in accordance with
the programme of work established by the Commission
itself.

UNAMA's investigation and monitoring capacity
has been strengthened with the arrival of new staff
members assigned specifically to the area of human
rights. The Mission now has one international human-
rights officer in each of its regional offices, and we
envisage that each of them will be assisted by two
national officers.

Two United Nations Special Rapporteurs have
visited Afghanistan very recently: Mrs. Asma Jahangir,
Special Rapporteur on extrajudiciary, summary and
arbitrary executions and Mr. Kamal Hossain, Special
Rapporteur on the human rights situation in
Afghanistan.

Another key component of the Bonn process is
the preparation for elections, which are called for by
the middle of 2004. As I informed the Council in
September, the Electoral Assistance Division of the
Department of Political Affairs visited Afghanistan,
and consultations are now under way with the Afghan
authorities, as well as with donors, on how to proceed
with the various issues that need to be addressed.
Among them are the formation of an electoral
commission, the determination of elector-identification
systems, the drafting of an electoral law and other laws
governing the functioning of political parties.

On the relief, recovery and reconstruction side, a
very successful meeting of the Implementation Group
was held in Kabul in mid-October, bringing together
the Government, donors, the United Nations and other
multilateral and non-governmental organization
partners. The Government presented a working draft of
its development plan and budget, which outlines a
vision for Afghanistan's budget and its priorities. The
working draft was developed through a consultative
process, led by a tripartite group comprised of the
Ministries of Finance, Planning and Reconstruction and
supported by the programme secretariats and UNAMA.
This illustrates how far the Government has come in
developing policies and decisions through intra-
ministerial processes.

The draft budget arranges the Government's
programme into 12 areas, organized within three
pillars: first, human capital and social protection;
secondly, physical infrastructure; and thirdly, trade and
investment and the rule of law and security. The next
step will be to present a full national development
budget before the beginning of the Afghan fiscal year
in March 2003. Pending the finalization of the budget,
the Government has identified a number of national
projects as priority areas for the period through March
2003. These are the ongoing national solidarity and
public works programmes and projects in education,
infrastructure, urban infrastructure and water resources
investment, national governance and transport, mainly
major roads and airports.

The Government has received enough funds to
cover its operating budget for the current fiscal year,
and the donors are to be commended for their
generosity. However, if the Government is to sustain its
efforts, further revenue from the regions will have to be
returned to the Government coffers.

The Government has taken an important step to
reform the country's finances through the introduction
of a new currency. This ongoing process aims to
revitalize the financial and banking systems throughout
the country and to end the ability of other groups to
print currency. The United Nations is helping the
Government implement this important project.

One promising example of the United Nations
effort to complement Government-led efforts is the
2003 consolidated appeal for Afghanistan that is
known as the Transitional Assistance Programme for
Afghanistan. It will set out the priorities, strategies and
requirements for coordinated international assistance in
support of relief, recovery and reconstruction during
2003 and beyond. It will be structured to fit in with the
Government budget cycle, and, most important, its
programmes will build upon the priorities and
programmes set out by the Government during its
budget process. Thus, the Programme should reflect
immediate and medium-term aims for reconstruction
and recovery as set out in the national development
budget, while at the same time addressing urgent
humanitarian needs associated with the effects of
drought, conflict and large population movements.
Consultations among Government counterparts, non-
governmental organizations, donors and United
Nations agencies are currently under way to finalize
this document.

At the moment, the Government and the United
Nations are giving high priority to preparing for winter
and putting in place the assistance that vulnerable
groups will need to survive. Some 2.2 million people
have been identified as being the most vulnerable and
in need of winter assistance in the north, the west, the
central highlands and the south. Special attention is
also being given to those living in rural areas who will
potentially be cut off, and in need of support.

In urban areas, priority will be given to returnees
and internally displaced persons who lack adequate
shelter or support mechanisms, and extremely
vulnerable indigenous families. The United Nations has
begun stockpiling and pre-positioning food and shelter
items, and plans are being finalized to ensure that
access to isolated communities is maintained.
However, there are still outstanding needs for shelter,
fuel, blankets and other items, for which additional
resources are urgently needed from donors.

In the health sector, a three-day nationwide
immunization campaign against polio started in
Afghanistan on 22 October, supported by the Ministry
of Public Health, the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
Afghan health professionals have made significant
strides in recent years towards the global objective of
polio eradication, a remarkable achievement given the
circumstances they face. So far in 2002, there have
been only seven new cases of polio reported compared
to 27 two years ago.

With regard to the return of refugees, we remain
concerned that Afghanistan does not currently have the
capacity to absorb the large numbers of refugees who
are returning. More than 1.5 million Afghans have
returned this year from Pakistan alone. Work is
therefore being undertaken to coordinate the return
process with the host countries.

On 22 October, Afghanistan, Pakistan and the
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) held discussions on the return
operations for the coming year, and an agreement in
principle was reached regarding a framework for the
voluntary repatriation of Afghans from Pakistan. A
similar tripartite commission, comprising Iran,
Afghanistan and UNHCR, is scheduled to meet on 3
and 4 November in Kabul.

Following the Implementation Group meeting,
the Government presented its counter-narcotics
strategy at an international meeting in Kabul convened
by the National Security Council, which is now in
charge of coordinating Afghanistan's counter-narcotics
effort. Unfortunately, a significant increase in opium
production is foreseen this year. It is expected that it
will take the best part of the decade before opium
production is eradicated, as strengthened legal and
security measures and the creation of alternative
livelihoods become effective realities.

I am often asked if, in the light of events over the
last 12 months, there is real scope for optimism in
Afghanistan. My answer is a confident but somewhat
qualified yes. Considering where it was a year ago,
Afghanistan has made remarkable progress. But
considering where it needs to go, Afghanistan needs
continued commitment from its leaders to work
together, to achieve genuine reconciliation, and as I
said earlier, to accept and strengthen the idea that
Afghanistan belongs to all its citizens.

There is also a continued need for international
attention and sustained support to the people of
Afghanistan. The people of Afghanistan are looking to
the United Nations in general, and to the Security
Council in particular, to continue to mobilize and
organize the support of the international community for
the peace process in Afghanistan.
