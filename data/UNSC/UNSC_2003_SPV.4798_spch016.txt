The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now
take the floor in my capacity as representative of Spain.

I thank Ambassador Munoz for his
comprehensive and detailed briefing on the work of the
Security Council Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1267 (1999). I also welcome the presence of
the Monitoring Group and its constant and dedicated
work. Spain fully subscribes to the statement that will
be made shortly by Italy on behalf of the European
Union. Therefore, I shall limit my statement to a few
brief observations.

First, I wish to highlight what has been achieved
since the adoption of resolution 1455 (2003). Among
those achievements, I must cite the improvement in the
format and content of the consolidated list, the
adoption of guidelines to assist States in preparing their
reports and the increase in the Committee's
transparency and communication. I must also mention
the beginning of coordination and information-sharing
between the 1267 Committee and the Counter-
Terrorism Committee, which will undoubtedly help to
improve the work of both Committees and, therefore,
the fight against terrorism.

Finally, I wish to recall - as has the Chairman of
the 1267 Committee - that success in this struggle
depends on the cooperation of States. All of us must
meet our obligations under international law and the
Charter of the United Nations.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Italy. I invite him to take a seat at the
Council table and to make his statement.
