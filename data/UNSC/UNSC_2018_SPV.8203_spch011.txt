Mr. Umarov (Kazakhstan): Kazakhstan is known
forits clearandconsistentpositionas anuncompromising
opponent of all types of weapons of mass destruction,
including chemical weapons. We condemn the use of
weapons of mass destruction as immoral, inhuman and
contrary to the principles of humanity. We express our
deep concern about the tragic incident involving the
possible use of chemical warfare agents on the territory
of the United Kingdom. The use of chemical agents,
regardless of location or target, is unacceptable.

At the same time, since this is a very politically
sensitive issue, we must be extremely careful in
drawing hasty conclusions without credible or
convincing facts on the ground. The incident should
be carefully investigated and all conclusions must
be substantiated. We believe that an international
response to the incident should be considered only after
an exhaustive, transparent, objective and impartial
investigation, undertaken in accordance with existing
norms ofinternational law, primarily on the basis of the
provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention.

We hope that both parties can resolve the
contradictions and disputes between them by diplomatic
means and normalize relations for the benefit of global
stability and security.
