The President (interpretation from Chinese): I thank
the representative of Zambia for the kind words he
addressed to me.

There are no further speakers. The Security Council

has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration
of
 

the item on the agenda. The Security Council will remain
seized of the matter.

I take this opportunity to thank all present for their
attention throughout what was a lengthy meeting.

The meeting rose at 2.25 pm.
