The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank Judge
Mose for the clarifications that he provided.
There are no further speakers on my list. The
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

I would like to take this opportunity to express
my thanks, on behalf of the Council, to Judge Pocar
and Judge Mose, as well as to the Prosecutors, Ms. Del
Ponte and Mr. Jallow, for their briefings to the Council.

The meeting rose at 1.55 pm.
