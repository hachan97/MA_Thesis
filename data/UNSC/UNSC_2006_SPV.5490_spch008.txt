Mr. Manongi (United Republic of Tanzania): The
United Republic of Tanzania voted in favour of the
resolution we have just adopted, bearing in mind the
gravity of the circumstances arising from the missiles
launched by the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea. It is therefore our hope that the message being
sent by the resolution will be one that engenders a
spirit of dialogue and cooperation in order to allow for
an environment of peace and security in the Korean
peninsula and in North-East Asia. That course of action
is in the interests not only of that region alone, but of
the international community at large.
