Mr. De Mistura: I will keep my remarks
extremely brief in view of the time and the fact that we
are very satisfied with what we have heard today.

I would like to make two points. First, we will do
our best to implement the common understanding that
we perceive as becoming apparent in the Security
Council regarding the review and the future mandate
and activities of the United Nations Assistance Mission
in Afghanistan (UNAMA). Of course, that will be
based on the work done in the context of the review
process and on the realities on the ground, so that the
Council, which will make the mandate adjustments,
will be able to consider the results of the review. We
will do our best to do that together.

Secondly, I would like to say a few words about
an issue that we have not flagged enough here today. I
was planning to do so myself at a certain point. The
issue pertains to 51 per cent of the Afghan population:
the women of Afghanistan. We will continue to
consider it part of our duties to help the Afghan
authorities ensure that Afghan women will continue to
have a better future. A total of 69 women are members
of Parliament. Recently, we have been very concerned
about a number ofissues related to women's shelters. I
will insist on that point because it is part of the human
rights mandate of UNAMA to do everything we can to
assist this large, important part of the Afghan
population.

A female Afghan Member of Parliament
reminded me that one of the most important areas is
education. If you teach and educate a man, you educate
a man; if you educate a woman, you educate a family.
She reminded me of that just before I came here, so I
take this opportunity to recall it here today.
