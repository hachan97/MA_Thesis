Mr. Kumalo (South Africa): Let me begin by
thanking you, Mr. President, very much for hosting this
meeting today. We believe that this is an important
meeting, and we are pleased that you are able to invite us
to participate in it.

The South African Government welcomes the report
of the Panel on violations of Security Council sanctions
against UNITA. In the coming weeks, my Government will
be studying this report with great care, and we look forward
to the following meetings at which the sanctions Committee
will discuss this same subject. At the same time, we look
forward to receiving more evidence on the allegations that
are contained in the report. We support all the United
Nations sanctions against UNITA and shall continue to
work closely with the United Nations for the success of
these measures in order to secure a peaceful solution to the
conflict in Angola.

We are aware that some of our citizens have been
involved in efforts aimed at undermining the United
Nations sanctions. We shall take firm action against those
involved. South Africa will continue to advocate a political
solution to the conflict in Angola, as we remain convinced
that there can be no lasting military solution. We once
again urge UNITA to abandon war and embrace peace.
