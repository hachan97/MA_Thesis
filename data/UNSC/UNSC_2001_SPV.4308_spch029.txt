Mr. Annabi: I must confess that I do not have
detailed information on that, but we will try to get it
and get back to the Council at an appropriate
opportunity. What I can say is that it is striking to hear
from people in East Timor, especially from Timorese
women, that domestic violence is at a fairly high level
in East Timor. It is also one of the main concerns of our
colleagues in the Department of Justice and of their
Timorese counterparts. This is a serious problem which
will need to be addressed and to which some efforts
will need to be devoted.
