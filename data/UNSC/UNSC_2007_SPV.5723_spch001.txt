The President (spoke in Chinese): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Michael C.
Williams, Special Coordinator for the Middle East
Peace Process and Personal Representative of the
Secretary-General.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Williams to take a seat at the Council
table.

As this is the last time that Ambassador Jean-
Marc de La Sabliere will participate in the
deliberations of the Security Council in his capacity as
the Permanent Representative of France, I wish to take
this opportunity to express to him, on behalf of the
members of the Council, our appreciation of him as
both a colleague and a friend. Ambassador Jean-Marc
de La Sabliere has devoted a total of 13 years, in three
different assignments, to representing France at United
Nations Headquarters. He will likely best be
remembered as having ably led yearly missions of the
Security Council to Central Africa, most recently that
to the Democratic Republic of the Congo as part of the
Council's mission to Africa last month. Ambassador
De La Sabliere has also made an important
contribution through his active chairmanship of the
Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict.

In bidding Ambassador De La Sabliere a fond
farewell, the others members of the Council and I
would like to say that we wish him every success in his
new endeavours. Bon voyage.
