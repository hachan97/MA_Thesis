The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Armenia, Benin and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, in which they
request to be invited to participate in the discussion of
the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with
the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the
Council, to invite those representatives to participate in
the discussion without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, the
representatives of the aforementioned countries
took the seats reservedfor them at the side of the
Council Chamber.

The President (spoke in Spanish): I would like to
request that this afternoon's speakers kindly limit their
statements to a maximum of five minutes, taking into
account that we still have an extensive list of speakers
who would like to take the floor this afternoon.

On behalf of the members of the Council, I
extend a warm welcome to Her Excellency Ms. Marie-
Ange Lukinana Mufwankol, Minister of Gender,
Family and Children Affairs of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, and give her the floor.
