The President (spoke in French): I thank the
representative of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo for his statement. The message is of course
directed to all members of the Security Council, not
just the President.

There are no more speakers inscribed on my list.
I now invite Council members to informal
consultations to continue our discussion on the subject.

The meeting rose at 10.50 am.
