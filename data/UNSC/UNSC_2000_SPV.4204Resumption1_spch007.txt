The President: I thank the representative of
Jordan for his kind words addressed to me.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is Mr. Ibra
Deguene Ka, Chairman of the Committee on the
Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian
People. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table
and to make his statement.
