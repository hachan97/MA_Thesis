The President: I thank Mr. Takasu for his
statement.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded its consideration
of the item on its agenda. In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I should now like to invite Council
members to informal consultations to continue our
discussion on the subject.

The meeting rose at 3.45 p.m.
