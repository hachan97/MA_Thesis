The President: I thank the representative of Egypt
for the kind words he addressed to me.

The next speaker is the representative of
Mozambique. I should like to say how privileged I was to
visit Mozambique last week with Her Majesty the Queen.

I invite the representative of Mozambique to take a
seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
