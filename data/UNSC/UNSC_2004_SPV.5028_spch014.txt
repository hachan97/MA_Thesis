Mr. Adechi (Benin) (spoke in French): Benin
voted in favour of resolution 1559 (2004). The
initiative of the cosponsors was basically intended to
help stability in Lebanon, a friendly country that is
recovering from several years of civil war and has
managed to restore a peaceful democracy. My country
voted in favour of the draft resolution because we share
the concern to reaffirm the Council's support for the
sovereignty and independence of Lebanon.

Resolution 1559 (2004), just adopted, deals with
the situation in the Middle East. We would like to
reaffirm here our support for the efforts to bring about
a comprehensive political settlement in the Middle East
through the withdrawal of all foreign forces present in
the countries of the region. Accordingly, we have
repeatedly expressed our commitment to peace and
security in that region.
