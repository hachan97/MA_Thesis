Mr. Bessho (Japan): We voted against the proposal
submitted by the Russian Federation (S/2016/847).
I repeat what I said earlier today. All aerial
bombardments of Aleppo must be ended immediately.
All military activities in eastern Aleppo, particularly
the indiscriminate attacks that violate international
humanitarian law must be halted immediately. Had the
agreement of9 September between the United States of
America and Russia been in effect, we may have been
able to implement measures based on that. Sadly, that is
not the case. Japan cannot support the Russian proposal.
