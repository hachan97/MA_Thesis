The President: It is now 1.35 pm. I think it is an
appropriate time to break for lunch. But I Wish, before
we suspend the meeting, to remind all remaining
speakers that we have a very heavy workload in the
Security Council today. We have to complete
consideration of East Timor and also the special
meeting that we started yesterday on Africa. We also
have consultations on the Middle East. So I will urge
all remaining speakers to be as brief as possible in
order to enable us to complete our work for today. We
will resume at 3 pm.

The meeting was suspended at 1.35 pm.
