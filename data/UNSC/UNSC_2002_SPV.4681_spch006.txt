Mr. Kolby (Norway): Norway voted in favour of
the draft resolution. Norway urges both parties to avoid
harming civilians and to fully respect international law.
It is particularly important that international
humanitarian personnel carry out their important
humanitarian mission without threat to their personal
security. Having said that, we would like to reiterate
our strong condemnation of terrorist attacks by
Palestinian groups against Israeli civilians. Such
attacks achieve nothing but misery; they escalate the
conflict and create obstacles to a resumption of the
peace process.

We call on the Palestinian Authority to fight
terrorism one hundred per cent, in words as well as in
deeds, with strengthened and reformed security
structures. Terrorist organizations must stop killing
innocent civilians; they must disarm and engage in a
democratic political process. In parallel, the
Palestinians should advance the entire reform agenda
and fully respect democratic principles, the rule of law
and freedom of speech. Only thus will the international
community be able to fully engage in building a viable
Palestinian state.
