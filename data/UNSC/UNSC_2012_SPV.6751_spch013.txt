Mr. Moraes Cabral (Portugal): Portugal
welcomes the adoption of resolution 2042 (2012). The
Security Council has just sent a united message with its
unanimous adoption of a resolution on Syria. It is a
first step, although one that comes tragically late and in
the wake of thousands of dead and injured. It is only a
first step; others will have to follow to ensure the full
cessation of violence and to avoid a civil war.

Portugal reiterates its full support and
appreciation for the efforts of the Joint Special Envoy
of the United Nations and the League of Arab States.
We call on the Syrian Government to cooperate with
him fully and without delay and to immediately and
visibly implement the six-point plan in its entirety, as it
has committed to do.

Portugal also stresses the importance - indeed,
the absolute necessity - of the withdrawal of all
Syrian Government troops and heavy weapons from
population centres to their barracks. Portugal also calls
upon the Syrian Government to ensure the effective
operation of the United Nations monitoring mission,
including its advance team, as set forth in the
resolution we just adopted. All parties must guarantee
the safety of the United Nations monitors without
prejudice to their freedom of movement and access. We
reiterate our appeal for full, immediate and unimpeded
humanitarian access. We also wish to stress the need
for all those responsible for human rights violations to
be held accountable.

We call on all parties to seize this opportunity, to
cease all armed violence in all its forms and to fully
cooperate with Special Envoy Annan, to initiate a
Syrian-led, credible political process that will meet the
legitimate expectations of the Syrian people in terms of
freedom, democracy and equality.
