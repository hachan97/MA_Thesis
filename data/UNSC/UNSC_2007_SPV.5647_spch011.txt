Mr. Arias (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): Panama
understands its participation in the Security Council to
be a fiduciary responsibility to the Members and
organizations of the United Nations to promote
international peace and security. In that context,
Panama is pleased that the Security Council was able
to act unanimously in sending a message of clear
concern to the people and Government of Iran as
regards their nuclear programme.

Nevertheless, whenever the Council adopts a
resolution to impose sanctions, that clearly is a failure
of the political process. Panama therefore calls upon all
parties to launch as soon as possible a negotiations
process aimed at resolving the conflict that prompted
the Security Council to act today. Panama has taken
note of the fact that all parties have acknowledged that
Iran has a right to use nuclear energy for peaceful
purposes, and that like all other parties to the Treaty on
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons it also has
an obligation to prevent the same.

Panama therefore understands that all that is
lacking is determination and good faith in order to
understand and share the concern of the international
community.
