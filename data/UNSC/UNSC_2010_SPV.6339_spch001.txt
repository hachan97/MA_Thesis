The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2010/3ll, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by China, France, the
Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of
America.

I should also like to draw the Council's attention
to the report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations operation in Cyprus and to the report of the
Secretary-General on his mission of good offices in
Cyprus, which have been issued as documents
S/2010/264 and 8/2010/238, respectively.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I should like to inform the Council that the presidency
of the Council has met with the representatives of the
parties, who maintain their well-known positions vis-a-
vis the item on the Council's agenda. On the basis of
those meetings, with the consent of the members of the
Council, the presidency has drawn the conclusion that
the Council can proceed to take a decision on the draft
resolution before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall
put the draft resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
France, Gabon, Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria,
Russian Federation, Uganda, United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States
of America
2
Against:
Turkey

The President (spoke in Spanish): There were 14
votes in favour and one against. The draft resolution
has been adopted as resolution 1930 (2010).

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements after the voting.
