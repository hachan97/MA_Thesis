Mr. Liden (Sweden): The humanitarian situation in
Iraq, described in unequivocal terms in the report of the
Secretary-General, gives rise to deep concern. The
population of Iraq, in particular children, continues to face
a serious nutritional and health situation. There is an
urgent need to contain the risk of further deterioration.

Sweden fully supports the recommendation by the
Secretary-General to extend the so-called oil-for-food
mechanism established by resolution 986 (1995). This
mechanism is an important instrument to help alleviate
the current plight of the Iraqi population.

Improvements to the mechanism can and should be
made. Sweden commends the initiative of the Secretary-
General to conduct a thorough review of the oil-for-food
programme and to submit a supplementary report at the
beginning of 1998, containing his recommendations on

 

ways to streamline the arrangements. We support, and will
actively contribute to, all endeavours aimed at achieving a
more targeted, focused and flexible approach to address the
humanitarian situation in Iraq. An increase of the revenues
through the sale of more oil, together with improvements to
the implementation of the programme, could make this
instrument more effective. In due time, Sweden would like
the Council to be ready to consider favourably the
recommendations by the Secretary-General to this effect.

At the same time, the oil-for-food programme under
resolution 986 (1995) cannot alone satisfy all the
humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. The Government of
Iraq bears a heavy responsibility towards its population.
The allocation of national resources to meet humanitarian
needs is therefore essential.

Sweden supports the draft resolution before us.
