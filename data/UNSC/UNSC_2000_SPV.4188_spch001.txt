shall take it that the Security Council agrees to extend
an invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Bernard Miyet, Under-Secretary-
General for Peacekeeping Operations.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Miyet to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration ofthe item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Miyet, Under-Secretary-General for
Peacekeeping Operations. I give him the floor.
