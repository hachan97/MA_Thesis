Ms. Wronecka (Poland): First of all, let me thank
Mr. Jean-Pierre Lacroix for his informative briefing.
Let me also take this opportunity to express my deep
appreciation for the United Nations Organization
Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (MONUSCO) and its personnel for their
involvement in the stabilization and peace process.
Poland strongly condemns the latest attacks on
MONUSCO personnel. I would like to offer our sincere
condolences to the families of the victims and to the
authorities of Tanzania.

We are very concerned about the recent
developments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
We would like to underline that the Government of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo must comply with
its international obligations and protect the rights to
free assembly and freedom of speech. It is crucial to
guarantee democratic space for all actors involved.
We take note of the long-awaited announcement by
the Independent National Electoral Commission of
the Democratic Republic of the Congo of the electoral
calendar. It is important to ensure that the election is
held on 23 December, since it is crucial to avoid further
tensions and the possible escalation of violence in the
country. The activities of the Electoral Commission
must be credible, as they constitute the basis for fair
elections. We would like to emphasize the importance
of the voter registration process and encourage women
to take part in it.

Poland encourages further political dialogue
among all parties in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo. We also express our full support for the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General for
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as for
MONUSCO. We believe that regional organizations
can play a constructive role in the process of the
stabilization of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
