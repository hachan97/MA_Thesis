Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): I would
like to thank Deputy Secretary-General Eliasson
and Assistant Secretary-General Simonovic' for their
respective briefings. China has been closely following
developments in the situation in Ukraine.

The Security Council has repeatedly taken up the
question of Ukraine. China has explicitly stated its
principled position on the issues concerned. Respect for
the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity
of States is China's consistent position. China has
taken an fair and impartial approach in addressing
the question of Ukraine. We will continue to promote
peaceful dialogue and to play a more constructive role
in seeking a political solution to the crisis in Ukraine.
China has put forward the following proposals in order
to address the Ukrainian crisis.

An international coordinating mechanism comprising
all parties concerned should be established as soon as
possible in order to explore political ways to address
the situation in Ukraine. In the meantime, all parties
should refrain from taking any action that may further
exacerbate tensions. International financial institutions
should start to explore various possibilities to help
Ukraine maintain its economic and financial stability.
In our view, a political solution to the Crimean issue
should be found within the framework of law and order.

All parties concerned should exercise restraint and
refrain from any action that could cause the situation
to further deteriorate. The international community
should make constructive efforts to defuse tension.

China supports today's trip by Secretary-
General Ban Ki-Moon to the countries concerned to
conduct mediation. China hopes that the international
community will continue to make constructive efforts
to defuse tension.
