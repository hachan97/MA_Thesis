Mr. Cooney (Ireland): I will try to be as brief as
possible. I should like to start by thanking Mr.
Guehenno for his very informative briefing and for the
thoroughness with which he has answered many of the
questions that have been put to him. Sweden is going to
speak in a minute on behalf of the European Union, so
I will make only a few brief comments here.

We would like to re-emphasize the need to ease
frictions between the Albanian Serb and other
communities in Kosovo. I would therefore just like to
mention a number of areas where we feel there is room
for earlier confidence-building measures in this regard.

First, on the unacceptable level of violence
against minority ethnic groups, we feel that the Council
must insist that those with influence in their
communities use that influence correctly to oppose
such activities. I warmly welcome Mr. Guehenno's
report that he emphasized to the communities there the
need to do this.

Secondly, there is a need for the early return of
refugees. This has already been dealt with at some
length, but all I would do is encourage the United
Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo to
continue to give a high priority to its efforts in this
regard.

As to the release of the remaining Kosovar
Albanian political prisoners, we have already
welcomed the action of the Yugoslav authorities in
adapting and implementing an Amnesty Law, but I
must say that I was surprised to hear from Mr.
Guehenno that over 400 Kosovar Albanians are still in
detention. I would just like to ask why this is so and
how soon they will be released.

Lastly, on missing persons, we fully support the
idea of a joint mechanism or a joint committee to
clarify the fate of missing persons, but we would like
to see a representation of all affected communities on
such a mechanism.
