Mr. Sardenberg (Brazil): The delegation of
Brazil is of the view that the killing of Abdel Aziz
Al-Rantisi, together with other Palestinians, by Israeli
military forces acting under orders from their
Government in the Gaza Strip last Saturday, 17 April,
should be condemned by the Security Council as being
contrary to relevant international law. Such action
seriously damages the prospects for peace in the
Middle East. In furthering the deterioration it clearly
undermines international efforts, including those of the
Security Council. Absolute priority must be accorded
to efforts to bring the parties together at the negotiating
table.

The international community is fully aware that
the escalation of violence can only jeopardize the peace
process in the region. We call upon all sides to exercise
maximum restraint at this sensitive stage. We again
urge them to resume, as soon as possible, negotiations
for a peaceful settlement based on the road map that
was endorsed by the Security Council in resolution
1515 (2003).
