Mr. Bourgel (Israel) (spoke in French): We have taken note of the concerns expressed by certain members regarding the subject matter that my delegation chose to focus its statement on during this debate (see S/PV.8706). In that connection, we recall that the theme of this open debate is "The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question". It is therefore naturally up to each delegation to freely decide on the subjects it chooses to address, in accordance with its positions and concerns. That is the very essence of the wealth of our exchanges and we cannot imagine that some would seek to impose a single way of thinking on this matter from which it is prohibited to deviate. As far as my delegation is concerned, we do indeed believe that, at the risk of repeating ourselves, it is essential to recall that Iran's destabilizing activities constitute a serious threat to peace and security in our region. Iran is spending approximately $7 billion dollars a year to finance its networks - of course, to the detriment of its own citizens and theirneeds - and is exporting its missiles, as well as excessively disseminating its devastating ideology in violation of Security Council resolutions, particularly resolutions 1559 (2004), 1701 (2006), 2216 (2015) and 2231 (2015). Iran has openly called for the destruction of Israel, a State Member of the United Nations since 1949. It is therefore incumbent upon the Security Council and the international community to firmly condemn Iranian violations and to take all necessary measures to ensure that they are brought to an end at any cost.
