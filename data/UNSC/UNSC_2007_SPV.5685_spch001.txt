The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Lebanon, in which she requests
Lebanon to be invited to participate in the
consideration of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite the representative of
Lebanon to participate in the consideration without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

On behalf of the Council, I extend a warm
welcome to the Minister of Culture and Minister of
Foreign Affairs ad interim of Lebanon, His Excellency
Mr. Tarik Mitri.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Mitri
(Lebanon) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2007/315, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Belgium, France, Italy,
Slovakia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, and the United States of America.

Members also have before them documents
S/2007/281 and S/2007/286, containing two letters
dated 15 May and 16 May 2007, respectively,
addressed to the President of the Security Council from
the Secretary-General.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
I now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the
voting.
