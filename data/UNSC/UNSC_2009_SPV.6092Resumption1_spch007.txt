The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank the
representative of Italy for respecting the five minutes
assigned to him. I take this opportunity to remind
speakers to kindly confine themselves to the five-
minute limit and that all statements longer than five
minutes should be condensed.

I give the floor to the representative of Egypt.
