The President: I agree with the representative of
China that very effective responses to threats to
international peace and security should be the result of
common efforts by all Member States, the United
Nations and regional organizations, in accordance with
the Charter.

I now invite the Secretary-General of the League
of Arab States, His Excellency Mr. Amre Moussa, an
old friend, to take the floor.
