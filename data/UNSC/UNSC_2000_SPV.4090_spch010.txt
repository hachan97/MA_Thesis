The President: I would like to draw the attention of
everybody here in the Chamber and watching on television
to the fact that the troika - with the Russians, speaking for
us; our colleagues the Portuguese, under Ambassador
Monteiro, who was with us today; and the United States -
is working effectively on this issue. This is an important
statement and I hope people will pay it due heed here and
in the rest of the world. I particularly draw attention to the
fact that, on a day when attention is focused on areas where
not all the members of the Security Council are in full
agreement, the troika is functioning effectively and that
the United States, Portugal and the Russian Federation
have come up with this important statement.

If we run out of time, as the last speaker I will
waive my right to speak and simply make my statement
available for the public record. I think most of what I was
going to say is contained in the troika statement in any
case; there are a few nuances which I would add as a
national means.
