Mr. Mahmoud (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Egypt
voted in favour of resolution 2260 (2016), concerning
the United Nations Operation in cote d'Ivoire (UNOCI).
We had hoped that the resolution would highlight the
request of the Government of C6te D'Ivoire for the
sanctions imposed against it to be lifted. However,
given the importance of the resolution and the positive
message it sends to the Government and the people
of cote d'Ivoire, in particular regarding the country's
decisive achievements in its democratic and political
development and in the light of the progressive
drawdown of UNOCI, the delegation of Egypt joined in
the unanimous adoption of the resolution.

Egypt continues to believe that it would be
appropriate to lift the measures imposed against
the Government of Cote D'Ivoire in the context of
the discussion regarding the future of UNOCI. It is
important to undertake efforts, in parallel with the
UNOCI drawdown, to reform the security sector in
order to enable the elected national Government of C6te
d'lvoire to assume its responsibilities in the maintenance
of peace and security throughout its territory, given the
major regional security challenges facing the country.
Efforts towards economic and political reform and
national reconciliation must therefore continue to be
pursued.

We look forward to engaging in an in-depth
discussion on the lifting of sanctions and to the review
of the cote d'Ivoire sanctions regime to take place in
March.

The meeting rose at 10.10 am.
