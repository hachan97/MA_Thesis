Mr. Cohen (United States of America): I thank
Special Envoy De Mistura for his briefing.

The United States, along with all other members
of the small group - Egypt, France, Germany, Jordan,
Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom - and other
like-minded Security Council partners are united in our
position that the United Nations should move swiftly
to convene the constitutional committee. We continue
to strongly support Special Envoy De Mistura's efforts
towards the formation of that committee in November.

As the Special Envoy noted, the constitutional
committee must be credible, balanced and
representative of the Syrian people, and we note,
despite what the Special Envoy heard in Damascus,
that the United Nations has exclusive control over the
committee's membership, schedule and scope of work,
as affirmed by the Russian Federation in its January
2018 Sochi declaration.

Further obstruction of the committee's formation
is unacceptable. Further delay risks squandering
the window of opportunity provided by the Turkish
and Russian demilitarized zone, which succeeded in
preventing further bloodshed in Idlib and beyond. The
parties have been consulted. No one should doubt that
the United Nations Special Envoy has the mandate to
move forward to establish the constitutional committee.
Any list in that respect, by whomever proposed, must
have the approval of the Special Envoy, not just in
its membership but in how it is compiled. That is his
charge, and not just from Sochi, but from paragraph 2
of resolution 2254 (2015).

We should be in full agreement as to the fact that
there is no alternative to a United Nations political
process as described in that resolution and agreed
by unanimous decision of the Council. That political
process must move forward now.
