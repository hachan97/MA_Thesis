The President: I thank the representative of
Colombia for her very personal dedication to a Colombia
in peace.

Let me also take this opportunity to once again
stress the importance, in an open meeting like this
before the international community, that we all come
out in strong support for the implementation of this
peace agreement.

I now invite Council members to informal
consultations to continue our discussion on the subject.

The meeting rose at 3.45 pm.
