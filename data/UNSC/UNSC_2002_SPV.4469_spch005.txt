The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank Mr.
Brahimi for the information he has provided. As
President, I recognize the immense effort that the
complex circumstances in Afghanistan have required of
him in his capacity as Special Representative of the
Secretary-General. I congratulate him, the United
Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan and the
Secretary-General on their work.

In accordance with the understanding reached in
the Council's prior consultations, I should now like to
invite Council members to informal consultations to
continue our discussion on the subject.
