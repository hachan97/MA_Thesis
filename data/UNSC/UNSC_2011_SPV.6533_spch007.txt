The President (spoke in French): I thank
Mr. Eugene-Richard Gasana for his statement. The
Council believes that the work being carried out by the
Peacebuilding Commission is of the greatest
importance, and I wish to thank all three speakers for
the contributions they made.

I now give the floor to members of the Council
who wish to make statements.
