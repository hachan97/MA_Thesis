Mr. Habiyaremye (Rwanda) (interpretation from French): I have no words to express our sympathy for
peoples who are suffering. The least the delegation of
Rwanda could do was to vote in favour of the resolution we
have just adopted, but I believe that our Council's action
will not be confined to this expression of intent. A firm
political determination to put an end to the horrors
described in the Secretary-General's report must follow.

I am comforted by the words of the Ambassador of
the United States, who, with the dispatch of 60,000 men to
the ravaged region, has just told us - and I will try to
paraphrase her: "We hope that this will be the last
slaughter." I would hope that every delegation here would
do or say the same. Yes, justice will be had, we hope. We
hope that it will solve the problems currently besetting the
Balkan region.
