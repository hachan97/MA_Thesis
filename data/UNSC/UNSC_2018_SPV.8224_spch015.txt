Mr. Tanoh-Boutchoue (Cote d'Ivoire) (spoke in French): Cote d'Ivoire reiterates its principled position
that all use of chemical weapons, in whatever form, in
times ofpeace or in times ofwar, should be condemned.
It stresses that it is imperative to shed full light on the use
of chemical nerve agents in Salisbury, in collaboration
with the relevant bodies, in particular the Organization
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). In
that regard, my country urges all States to provide all
necessary information to the OPCW with a View to
assigning responsibility for the 4 March incident.
