Mr. Inchauste Jordan (Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish):
Bolivia voted in favour of draft resolution S/2017/1060,
submitted today by the delegation of Egypt, because
the draft resolution reaffirms that the final status
of the city of Jerusalem should be resolved through
negotiations and that any decision or act that seeks to
change the status or the demographic composition of
Jerusalem does not have any legal effect. Such actions
should be null and void and should be revoked in line
with the relevant General Assembly and Security
Council resolutions. Furthermore, we reiterate that it is
essential to reverse the negative trends on the ground,
which are jeopardizing the two-State solution, and to
strengthen the regional and international efforts to
achieve a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the
Middle East.

In that regard, we once again call on the Government
ofthe United States ofAmerica to reconsider its decision
to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and to
move its diplomatic representation to that city, since
that would only undermine any possibility of dialogue
between the parties and make it even more difficult
to reach a long-term peaceful solution to the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict. Moreover, that same decision is
a clear violation of resolution 478 (1980), which refers
to, inter alia, the withdrawal by Member States of their
diplomatic missions from Jerusalem.

We once again wish to recall that it was the United
Nations that established the special international status
for the city of Jerusalem and that the Security Council
decreed that any measure that alters the geographical,
demographic or historical character of the city of
Jerusalem is null and void and has no effect.

Bolivia continues to believe that the sole long-
term alternative for settling the conflict is the two-
State solution, whereby ultimately a free, sovereign
and independent Palestinian State will be established
within the pre-1967 borders and with East Jerusalem
as its capital, pursuant to the relevant Security Council
and General Assembly resolutions.
