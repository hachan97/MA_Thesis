Mr. Quinlan (Australia): When we met on 29 April
on the situation in Ukraine (see S/PV.7l65), we urged
Russia to abide by the commitments it made in Geneva
on 17 April, including to refrain from violence,
intimidation and provocative actions. Since then, as
Under-Secretary-General Feltman has just told us,
the situation has further deteriorated severely. This
planned and coordinated destabilization could not
happen without external support. The shooting down of
Ukrainian helicopters in Sloviansk today by surface-to-
air missiles is dramatic further evidence of that. We are
witnessing well-armed, well-trained personnel, using
military weapons, who are intent on armed provocation.
We have seen further takeover and consolidation of
control by armed militia groups over key facilities in
cities and towns right across eastern Ukraine, including
Donetsk, Kharkiv, Mariupol, Sloviansk and Holivka.
Orchestrated violence has today spread to Odessa.

Journalists in eastern Ukraine have been detained.
There are kidnappings and torture. The Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe observers,
detained on 25 April, are still being held hostage a
week later. That is an affront to the entire international
community, and they must be released immediately.

Those actions by pro-Russian groups are clearly
not a legitimate protest or an attempt to protect Russian
speakers from alleged or spurious threats. They are
calculated, cynical and highly provocative actions,
obviously designed to undermine Ukrainian State
authority, to intimidate and de-stabilize. They make
a mockery of what Russia has committed to in the
Geneva agreement.

Ukraine itself is working to implement its Geneva
commitments. It has submitted to Parliament a draft law
and amnesty for protesters who surrender their weapons.
It has initiated a process of constitutional reform aimed
at decentralizing power. It has committed to holding a
broad public debate on possible constitutional change.
However, in response to the extreme provocation that
Ukraine is facing, Ukrainian authorities have the right
and responsibility to seek to reinstate State authority
and restore public order over all their territory.

Ukrainian authorities have given clear messages to
militant groups as to what is required ofthem, as Interior
Minister Avakov has said: "Free the hostages. Lay
down weapons. Vacate administrative buildings, and
get municipal infrastructure back to normal". That has
not happened. In these circumstances, it is appropriate
and necessary for the Ukrainian Government to take

measures to try to ensure security and protect its own
citizens in its own territory.

We have seen a statement from Russia's Foreign
Ministry earlier today describing - hypocritically,
shamelessly - the policy of those who have supported
Ukraine as "destructive". But what is destructive
is Russia's reckless interference in its neighbour's
affairs - destructive of Ukraine's stability and
territorial integrity, destructive of the Geneva
agreement, destructive of regional security, destructive
of the Charter of the United Nations and the laws
governing relations between countries and destructive
of Russia's own standing and credibility.

We are at a very dangerous, manipulated moment,
and Russia must immediately de-escalate the situation,
ensure that militia groups desist in their armed rebellion,
implement the Geneva agreement and demonstrate,
as President Putin has claimed, that it has no further
territorial ambitions on Ukraine. That certainly does
not appear to be the case.
