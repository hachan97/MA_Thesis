The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of Cuba
in which he requests to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the discussion without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Rodriguez
Parrilla (Cuba) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in response to the request contained in
the letter dated 26 February 1996 from the Permanent
Representative of the United States of America to the
United Nations addressed to the President of the Security
Council, document S/1996/ 130. Members of the Council
have received photocopies of a letter dated 26 February
1996 from the charge d'affaires ad interim of the
Permanent Mission of Cuba to the United Nations
addressed to the President of the Security Council, which
will be issued as a document of the Security Council under
the symbol S/1996/137.

I call on the representative of Cuba.
