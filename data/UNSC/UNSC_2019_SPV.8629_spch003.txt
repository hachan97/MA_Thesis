The President: I thank Ms. Gawanas for
her briefing.

I wish to acknowledge that we have some colleagues
from the African Union Peace and Security Council
here with us today, and to welcome them to the Security
Council. I hope that they find our deliberations useful.

I now give the floor to Ms. Chebbi.
