Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation should like to propose an oral amendment to paragraph 6 of the draft resolution contained in document S/2020/24. We propose that the words (spoke in English) "and in accordance with the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence" be deleted from the current text and replaced with the following phrase: "and in accordance with the guiding principles of humanitarian emergency assistance, as contained in United Nations General Assembly resolution 46/182".
