Ms. Onanga (Gabon) (interpretation from French):
The serious human rights violations in the former
Yugoslavia in 1991 called for a response from the
international community, and in particular the United
Nations. Thus five years ago, on 25 May 1993, Security
Council resolution 827 (1993) provided for the
establishment of an international Tribunal to try persons
presumed to be responsible for serious violations of
international humanitarian law committed in the territory of
the former Yugoslavia. Gabon reaffirms its full support for
this special Tribunal.
In his letter of 5 May 1998, the Secretary-General,
referring to the letter of 16 April 1998 from the President
of the Tribunal, asked for a third Trial Chamber to be
established. This request is justified by the fact that the
capacities of the two existing Trial Chambers are limited
and at saturation point because of the very great increase in
the number of persons charged and held. The decision to
increase the number of Trial Chambers of the Tribunal for
the Former Yugoslavia will make it possible to improve the
functioning of the Tribunal, particularly its capacity to try
cases.

The Council will recall that two weeks ago, through
resolution 1165 (1998) of 30 April 1998, it decided, for
similar reasons, to create a third Trial Chamber for the
International Tribunal for Rwanda.

For all these reasons, the delegation of Gabon can
only vote in favour of the draft resolution before us.
