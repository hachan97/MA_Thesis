Mr. Elaraby (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic):
The draft resolution before the Security Council today on
the situation in Burundi reflects the grave concern of the
international community over the very fragile conditions
in that country, which is friendly towards Egypt and
enjoys bonds with it that date back to the dawn of history.
The adoption of the draft resolution will affirm that
the international community has actually derived benefit
from the lessons of the recent past and is convinced that
an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure: had we
moved at the right time within the ambit of preventive
diplomacy, we could have prevented catastrophes such as
those that have afflicted the Great Lakes region of Africa
for about two years now, with Rwanda still suffering their
scourge.

The efforts by the Secretary-General, his Special
Representative in Burundi, the Organization of African
Unity (OAU), its military observers, the European Union
and many prominent people on the African and
international scenes affirm that the international
community is fully resolved to prevent a repetition of the
internal strife that has taken place in several African
countries in the past few years, damaging their national
unity and preventing the peoples of Africa from giving

 

their full concentration to achieving economic development
and joining in the march of progress.

In this regard, on 29 November last Egypt hosted a
conference, in Cairo, on ways and means of underpinning
stability in the Great Lakes region.

Egypt will vote in favour of the draft resolution before
the Council, thus underscoring its keen interest in
maintaining Burundi's national unity and stability, and law
and order in that country and in the Great Lakes region.

We urge all parties to exercise restraint and to refrain
from any act of violence as necessary conditions for
allowing a national dialogue to begin in which all elements
in society will take part with a view to achieving national
reconciliation, security and democracy for Burundi. We
hope that the comprehensive report to be submitted to the
Council by the Secretary-General under the terms of
operative paragraph 7 of the draft resolution will contain
encouraging elements showing that national dialogue has
actually begun, so that the international community can
continue its support for Burundi.

In conclusion, we also hope that security and
protection for United Nations personnel and members of the
international relief organizations will be assured, in order to
ensure that humanitarian assistance to Burundi continues to
flow.
