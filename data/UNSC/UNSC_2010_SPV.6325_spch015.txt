Mr. Araud (France) (spoke in French): I wish to
welcome the presence of the Minister for Foreign
Affairs of the Republic of Turkey. I also wish to thank
the Deputy Secretary-General for her presence, and
Mr. Fernandez-Taranco for his briefing.

We have expressed our emotions at the tragic
consequences of the Israeli operation against the
flotilla heading for Gaza. We have presented our
condolences to the victims and their families. The
human toll of this operation leads us to believe that
there was disproportionate use of force and a level of
violence that nothing justifies and that we condemn.
That being the case, before drawing conclusions it is
necessary to know the facts. Therefore, we would like
to have full light shed through an in-depth
investigation, which should be conducted immediately.
That investigation should be independent, credible and
in line with international standards.

Beyond this tragic event, this business reminds us
of the need to re-establish humanitarian access to Gaza
under resolution 1860 (2009), and we call for the
lifting of the blockade, which is unsustainable and
illegal.

France, like the European Union, requests that
consular access be granted immediately under the
Vienna Convention to the nationals of member States
who at this moment are being held in Israel after the
operation.

But beyond the Gaza event and the questions
raised by the blockade of Gaza, this incident brings to
mind the need to resume the peace process. In the
absence ofa credible peace process we are doomed to a
repetition of incidents, which are becoming bloodier
and bloodier. That is why France believes that a
meeting of the Quartet at the ministerial level could
enable both a lifting of the Gaza blockade and support
for resumption of the peace talks.
