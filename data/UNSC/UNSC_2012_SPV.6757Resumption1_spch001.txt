The President: Under rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure, I invite the
representatives of Kazakhstan and Ecuador to
participate in today's meeting.

I wish to remind all speakers to limit their
statements to no more than four minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Thomas
Mayr-Harting, Head of the Delegation of the European
Union to the United Nations.
