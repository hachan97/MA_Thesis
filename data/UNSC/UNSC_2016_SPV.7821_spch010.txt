Mr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): I thank the Secretary-
General for his presence and for his strong position on
the issue at hand.

Ukraine welcomes the unanimous adoption of
resolution 2321 (2016) and commends the efforts of
those delegations that were involved in drafting and
submitting the text. We consider the resolution to be a
comprehensive and balanced document that, on the one
hand, strengthens the existing regime and reinforces it
with additional sectoral and targeted sanctions, and, on
the other, confirms the Council's openness to dialogue
on a peaceful and diplomatic solution to the situation
on the Korean peninsula and its intention to avoid
affecting the North Korean population.

I would like to stress that the resolution was adopted
in response to the fifth and largest nuclear explosive
test conducted by the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea on 9 September, which constituted a blatant
violation of its international obligations, including
under relevant Security Council resolutions. Ukraine
has always been committed to effective multilateral
action against the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction. Our collective decision today represents
a historic step that clearly demonstrates the Council's
consolidated and firm stance to respond decisively to an
existing threat to the global non-proliferation regime.
Ukraine is honoured to co-sponsor the resolution, which
we all hope will contribute to the denuclearization of
the Korean peninsula.
