The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank
Ambassador Munir Akram for his briefing and for his
kind words addressed to me and my country, as well as
for the great service he rendered to the United Nations
as Chairman of a sanctions Committee during the two
years he was a member of the Security Council. I wish
him every success.

I now call on the last speaker on my list,
Ambassador Gunter Pleuger, Chairman of the Security
Council Committee established pursuant to resolution
1572 (2004), concerning Cote d'Ivoire.
