Mr. Salam (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): First of
all, I would like to congratulate Nigeria, Madame
President, on assuming the presidency of the Security
Council for the month of October. I also wish to thank
the President and all my colleagues for their kind
words about our work during our presidency of the
Council last month.

Permit me once again to say that, given the
events unfolding in Syria, Lebanon would like to
defend that brotherly Arab country and its right to
sovereignty and the integrity of its people and land,
including the right to ensure the security and safety of
all its citizens. We would also like once again to
express our great sorrow at the death of all victims in
sisterly Syria. Thus, in conformity with the position it
took on 3 August regarding the presidential statement
(S/PRST/20ll/l6), and in protection of Lebanon's
unity and stability, Lebanon today abstained from
voting on the draft resolution before us.
