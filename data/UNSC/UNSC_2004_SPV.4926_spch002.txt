Mr. Holliday (United States of America): The
adoption today by the Security Council of a resolution
to strengthen the implementation and enforcement of
the arms embargo imposed under resolution 1493
(2003) represents a critical step forward in our
collective effort to reduce the illegal flow of weapons
into the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We join
with other delegations in condemning the ongoing
violence and loss of life in the Congo perpetuated by
these illicit weapons flows.

Today's resolution creates a sanctions Committee
devoted to overseeing implementation of the arms
restrictions that the Council authorized in July 2003.
My delegation believes that the new Committee can
and should play a key role in bringing coordinated,
unified Council and international pressure to bear
against those who continue to ship arms to the
Democratic Republic of the Congo in direct violation
of existing multilateral restrictions.

The resolution provides us with helpful tools,
such as the new sanctions Committee, that the Council
can use to compel adherence by non-compliant parties
to the standards and obligations we establish. However,
the value of the information and recommendations
brought to our attention by the experts will be realized
only if the Council acts in response to such findings.
The United States stands ready to work closely with
other Council members to ensure that the arms
embargo imposed in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo is respected and fully implemented by all
parties.
