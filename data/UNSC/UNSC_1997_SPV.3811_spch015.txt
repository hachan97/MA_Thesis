The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as representative of the United Kingdom.

The fact that the immediate crisis in Albania has now
ended is largely due to the key roles played by the
multinational protection force and by the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Prompt and
effective action by the multinational protection force under
the leadership of the Italian Government helped ensure that
humanitarian aid could be delivered and that other
international organizations could operate in conditions of
safety. The OSCE's involvement was crucial not only in
ensuring that elections could be held, but also in
coordinating international assistance to Albania in general.
I would like to join others here in paying a warm tribute to
all those who contributed to such action, and in particular
to the Italian Government for its effective leadership of the
multinational protection force.

Elections may have been held, but Albania still faces
some tough challenges. The primary responsibility for
meeting those challenges rests with the Albanian people and
their Government. We welcome the commitment that the
new Government has made to promote reconciliation,
restore law and order and carry out economic reform. We
look to all sections of Albanian society to put aside their
past differences and to work together for that purpose. The
United Kingdom, together with other members of the
international community, is ready to provide much-needed
support and assistance. But international assistance will
crucially depend upon the willingness of the Albanian
Government itself to tackle the country's problems, to
ensure respect for the rule of law and for human rights
and to promote the conditions necessary to allow
economic recovery.

I resume my function as President of the Council.
The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative
of Albania, to whom I give the floor.
