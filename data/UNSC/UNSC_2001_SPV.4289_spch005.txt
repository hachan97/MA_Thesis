Mr. Levitte (France) (spoke in French): I should
like to welcome Minister Kerim to the Council
Chamber.

In addition to the statement which will be made
in a few moments by the Ambassador of Sweden on
behalf of the European Union, I should like to make a
few comments in my national capacity.

The Council, as the Minister has emphasized, is
meeting in his presence at a time when small armed
groups have for several days been provoking serious
incidents at the border between the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and Macedonia. The destabilization
attempts undertaken by such groups at the regional
level must be most strongly condemned. The extremists
must understand that the international community will
not allow them to continue carrying out those deeds.
They must be isolated, and their actions must be
stopped. This is indeed what the Kosovo Force has
undertaken to do with great determination by deploying
all the way to the border and cooperating more closely
with Macedonia.

Macedonia is a key element in the regional
balance. Its sovereignty and territorial integrity must be
respected. Its borders, confirmed by the agreement of
23 February, must be defended. Its internal stability
must be preserved. Since its independence, and with
wisdom, its leaders have implemented a policy
designed to ensure harmonious coexistence among all
of the communities that together make up Macedonia.
Everything must be done to maintain harmony in this
pluralistic society.

What is at stake is the future of a country as well
as the future of all of south-eastern Europe. France
resolutely supports the policy that is so consistently
and moderately being maintained by all the authorities
of the country to foster a pluralistic and democratic
Macedonia and peace in the region. President Chirac
said so when he received President Trajkovski in Paris.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Vedrine will say it again
in a few days in Skopje. In this test France is firmly at
the side of Macedonia.
