Mr. Licharz (Germany): We welcome the
Council's adoption today of resolution 2494 (2019),
renewing the mandate of the United Nations Mission
for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO)
until 31 October 2020. The Mission's work is vital to
ensuring stability on the ground and thereby providing
space for the political process. We want to explicitly
thank former Personal Envoy Horst Kohler for his
success in moving the political process forward, thereby
creating new momentum for direct negotiations. It will
be crucial to appoint a new Personal Envoy as soon as
possible in order to keep up the momentum and build
on the progress achieved. We call on the parties to lend
the same support and trust to his successor as they did
to President Kohler.

Besides the appointment of a new Envoy, it is
crucial to ensure that the Council remains engaged
and does everything to support progress on the
political track. For the political process to succeed,
the situation on the ground must remain calm. We
therefore commend MINURSO, its peacekeepers
and Special Representative of the Secretary-General
Stewart for their tireless and committed work. We call
on all sides to engage constructively with the Special
Representative and enable him to fulfil his mandate
without restrictions.
