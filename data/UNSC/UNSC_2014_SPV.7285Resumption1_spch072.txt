The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the
representative of Hungary for pointing out the shared
interest in the methods ofwork of the Security Council.
I also wish to thank Ms. Fatou Bensouda, Prosecutor of
the International Criminal Court.

Members know me, and so I would like formally
to close out the meeting by mentioning the fact that the
delegation of Argentina has, over the past two years,
worked with members - the experts - who have
made possible the six presidential notes that have been
adopted. With the Council's permission, I shall now
give the floor to a colleague to conclude the meeting.

Ms. Millacay took the Chair.

The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank you,
Madam President, for this honour.

There are no more names inscribed on the list of
speakers. The Security Council has thus concluded its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 6.35 pm.
