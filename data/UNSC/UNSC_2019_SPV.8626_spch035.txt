Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): In
his statement, the representative of the United States
referred to the question of Xinjiang, making groundless
accusations in a smear campaign against China. China
resolutely rejects all such accusations.

In his statement, State Councillor Wang Yi described
the counter-terrorism and deradicalization measures
taken by the Government of the Xinjiang autonomous
region of China. All these counter-terrorism measures
taken by China have effectively curbed the spread and
the frequent occurrence of terrorist activities and have
safeguarded the right to survival and development of
all people in Xinjiang. I urge the representative of the
United States to not stand on the opposite side of facts
and justice or, indeed, not to stand against the various
ethnic groups found among the people of Xinjiang.

With regard to counter-terrorism, we should reject
double standards. A crisis in Libya has demonstrated to
us the spread of terrorist forces to sub-Saharan Africa,
leaving the Sahel region profoundly victimized.

The wars in Iraq and Syria have also led to
the return of terrorists and the worldwide spread
of terrorism. Should the countries that advocate
humanitarian intervention and push for regime change
not be held responsible? Should they not engage in
serious self-reflection?
