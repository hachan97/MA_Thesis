Mr. Liden (Sweden): The Angolan peace process is
at a critical stage and is facing serious difficulties. No
efforts should be spared to bring it back on track. The
mechanism for achieving a lasting peace in Angola has
been clearly defined in the Lusaka Protocol. However,
peace cannot be achieved unless both parties fulfil their
obligations under the Protocol. The coming period will be
crucial both for the peace process and for national
reconciliation.

UNITA must remove the obstacles it has put on the
path to peace, and we expect that the Angolan
Government will fulfil its commitment to resort
exclusively to political dialogue and peaceful means in its
search for an exit from the present impasse. For its part,
the Security Council is ready to take its responsibility to
help the parties move towards peace.

Doubtless, a successful peace process requires the
participation of UNITA. However, UNITA has still not
taken concrete and irreversible steps to fulfil its remaining
obligations under the Lusaka Protocol. Therefore, the
Security Council must take the necessary measures to
ensure full compliance with its decisions. The scope of
the measures in the draft resolution before us, backed by
a unanimous Council, will send a clear message to Mr.
Savimbi that the international community will not accept
UNITA's continued obstruction of the peace process. At
the same time, we believe that the delayed entry into
force of these measures will serve as a useful incentive
for UNITA to fulfil its obligations.

The personnel of the United Nations and other
international organizations in Angola operate under very
difficult circumstances. Sweden urges both parties, in
particular UNITA, to cooperate fully with the United
Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) and to
guarantee the freedom of movement and the safety of the
personnel of the United Nations and other international
organizations.
