Mr. Kumalo (South Africa): My delegation
hopes that the adoption of this resolution will
demonstrate to the people of Somalia that the
international community does indeed care about their
situation. The deployment of the African Union
Mission is a start. We hope that it will signal that the
international community, through the Security Council,
will in the coming months also be able to deploy to
help the Somali people rebuild their country.

We look forward to the comprehensive dialogue
to be embarked upon by the Transitional Government,
because we too believe that a dialogue that includes all
parties, irrespective of their religious beliefs, will be
the key to Somalia's people being able to live side-by-
side in peace.

We thank the Council for this resolution. We hope
that this will be the beginning of a new relationship
with the people of Somalia.
