Mr. Faaborg-Andersen (Denmark): I too would
like to thank the Minister of Justice of Burundi and
Assistant Secretary-General Zacklin for their briefings.

We are very pleased to hear that the Transitional
Government in Burundi is committed to intensifying its
efforts to end impunity. A sustainable peace can be
secured only if perpetrators of crimes are brought to
justice. Neglect may endanger the progress already
made in securing peace and stability in Burundi. The
Burundians need the assistance of the United Nations
to make progress in bringing an end to impunity. We
find that the recommendations in the report on the
establishment of a national commission of inquiry and
a special judicial chamber strike a good balance
between justice and reconciliation and form a very
good basis for entering into further discussions.
Dialogue between the Transitional Government and the
United Nations Operation in Burundi on the specific
implementation modalities should thus commence as
soon as possible.

Let me also use this opportunity to commend
countries in the region for their constant effort to
support the peace process in Burundi, and particularly
the role played by South Africa and Tanzania, which
have had very significant, positive influence.

Finally, without Burundian ownership of the
process to end impunity, no real progress will be made.
Like others, we would like to hear suggestions from
the Minister as to how that ownership could be further
enhanced.
