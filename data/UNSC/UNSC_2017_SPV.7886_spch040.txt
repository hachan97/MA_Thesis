The President: I wish to remind all speakers to
limit their statements, if possible, to no more than four
minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its
work expeditiously and effectively. Delegations with
lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate
the text in writing and to deliver a condensed version
when speaking in the Chamber. I also wish to inform
the Council that we will carry on this open debate right
through the lunch hour, as we have a large number of
speakers on the list.

I now give the floor to Mr. Peter Szijjarto, Minister
for Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary.
