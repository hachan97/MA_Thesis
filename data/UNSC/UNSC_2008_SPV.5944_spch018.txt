Mr. Kumalo (South Africa): Once again, we
welcome the participation of Mr. Vuk J eremie, Foreign
Minister of Serbia, to our Council deliberations. We
also welcome Mr. Lamberto Zannier, Special
Representative of the Secretary-General, and thank him
for his briefing. In addition, we welcome the
participation of Mr. Skender Hyseni in this meeting.

South Africa has expressed its position on the
developments in Kosovo on several occasions in this
Chamber. It is not our intention to go over them again
today. However, they do inform our position with
regard to the Secretary-General's proposal on the
reconfiguration of the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and his
report on the activities of the Mission from 1 March to
25 June 2008 (S/2008/458).

We would like to emphasize the importance of
the fact that the current reconfiguration of UNMIK
must take place in a status-neutral manner and in line
with resolution 1244 (1999), which remains in effect
and valid for Kosovo. We are encouraged by the
Secretary-General's commitment to executing the
reconfiguration in line with that resolution.

We have noted from the Secretary-General's
report that UNMIK will cooperate with the European
Union under the authority of the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General and ultimately
the United Nations, as prescribed by resolution 1244
(1999). We look forward to future reports of the
Secretary-General on developments in that regard.

Finally, we particularly welcome the fact that one
of the functions foreseen for the Special Representative
of the Secretary-General in UNMIK in its reconfigured
form is to facilitate dialogue between Belgrade and
Pristina. We continue to encourage the parties to use
this opportunity to resume dialogue in the spirit of
reconciliation and with the intent of achieving an
amicable long-term political solution.
