The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda.

In a letter dated 16 November 1999 addressed to the
Secretary-General, the Prime Minister of Tuvalu submitted
the application of his country for membership in the United
Nations. That letter has been circulated in document
S/2000/5.

Under the provisions of rule 59 of the provisional
rules of procedure of the Security Council, unless the
Council decides otherwise, an application for membership
shall be referred by the President of the Council to the
Committee on the Admission of New Members.
Accordingly, unless I hear a proposal to the contrary, I
shall refer the application of Tuvalu to the Committee on
the Admission of New Members for examination and
report.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I would propose that the Committee on the
Admission of New Members meet today, 28 January, at
3.30 pm, in Conference Room 7, to consider the
application of Tuvalu for membership in the United
Nations.

The meeting rose at 12.25 pm.
