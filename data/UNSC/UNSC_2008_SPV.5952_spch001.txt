The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Finland and Georgia, in which they
request to be invited to participate in the consideration
of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity
with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of
the Council, to invite those representatives to
participate in the consideration of the item, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Alasania
(Georgia) took a seat at the Council table;
Ms. Lintonen (Finland) took the seat reservedfor
her at the side of the Council Chamber.
