Mr. Rosselli (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): Uruguay
voted in favour of resolution 2304 (2016), aware of
the grave humanitarian, human rights and security
situation resulting from the profound political crisis in
South Sudan, for which the country's main political and
military leaders are responsible. Violations of human
rights in South Sudan are of major concern to Uruguay,
due not only to their gravity but also to the systematic
way in which they are being committed by members
of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and the
SPLA in Opposition.

In the provisions of the resolution adopted today,
the Council has taken into account the views of the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)
and the African Union, as well as their request for
the mandate of the United Nations Mission in South
Sudan (UNMISS) to be adapted to the current situation
in South Sudan. Uruguay stresses the importance of
ongoing consultations with the Government of South
Sudan and the countries of the region to ensure the
timely and full implementation of the resolution. To
that end, we hope to count on the cooperation of the
Government of South Sudan and the States members
of IGAD.

We reiterate once again that the primary
responsibility for protecting civilians lies with the
authorities of the State in question. That having been
said, it is important in this critical situation for the
Government of South Sudan to end its obstructionist
activities and those that violate the status-of-forces
agreement, and to enable UNMISS to fulfil its principal
mandate to protect civilians.
