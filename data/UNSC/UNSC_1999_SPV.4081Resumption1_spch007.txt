The President: Could I say that I personally very
much welcome the representative of Ukraine's suggestion
for an international meeting on small arms sales and arm
sales in general. As we know, UNITA is the recipient of
arms from many arms suppliers, especially from Eastern
Europe. That suggestion is very welcome indeed.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Rwanda. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
