Mr. Adom (C6te d'Ivoire) (spoke in French): At the
outset, I would like to welcome the convening of this
meeting and commend Ms. Rosemary DiCarlo for her
comprehensive briefing.

Cote d'Ivoire has been closely following the latest
developments in Venezuela and deplores the sad events
that have taken place in recent days at the Venezuelan
border with Brazil and Colombia, resulting in the loss
of human life and extensive material damage, which
we of course regret. Cote d'Ivoire therefore wishes to
extend its condolences to the bereaved families and its
best wishes for the speedy recovery of the injured. We
also hope to see humanitarian assistance reaching those
who need it, regardless of where it comes from.

In underscoring the need to maintain a climate of
peace and stability, my delegation calls on all parties
to show restraint and encourages them to seek a
peaceful political solution through inclusive dialogue
in confronting a problem that is essentially political and
institutional in nature. We believe that the role of the
Secretary-General is useful and urgent in that regard.
The parties to the conflict in Venezuela would benefit
by availing themselves forthwith of his support in order
to save a population that they claim to love and for
whom they claim to be ready to spill the very last drop
of their blood.

Convinced of the fact that there is no military
solution to this crisis, my country urges all parties to
use all legal and peaceful means to find appropriate
solutions to the institutional and political conflict. My
delegation therefore calls on all stakeholders to engage
resolutely in a process of negotiation to seek consensual
solutions to the root causes of the crisis.

In conclusion, Cote d'Ivoire urges the international
community, including regional actors, to support the
Venezuelan people in their efforts to emerge from this
crisis by supporting all peaceful initiatives that may
help to reduce tensions.
