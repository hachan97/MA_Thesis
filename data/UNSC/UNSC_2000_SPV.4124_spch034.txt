Mr. Renninger: I am very conscious of the lateness
of the hour. I do not think there were any specific
questions directed to me, but I would be remiss if I did
not, on behalf of the Secretary-General, express our
gratitude for the many expressions of support and
encouragement we heard during the debate today.
