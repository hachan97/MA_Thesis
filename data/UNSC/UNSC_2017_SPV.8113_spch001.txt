The President: On behalf of the members of the
Security Council, I would like to condemn in the
strongest terms possible the unconscionable terrorist
attack in North Sinai, Egypt, which targeted civilians at
a place of worship. The members of the Security Council

those killed and their sympathy to the people and the
Government of Egypt. I ask those present to now rise in
a moment of silence for the victims.
