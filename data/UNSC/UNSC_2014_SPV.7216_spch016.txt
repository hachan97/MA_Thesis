The President: I shall now make a very brief
statement in my capacity as the representative of Rwanda.

Rwanda welcomes the unanimous adoption of
resolution 2165 (2014), on the humanitarian situation
in Syria. We commend the delegations of Australia,
Jordan and Luxembourg for introducing the resolution
and for their unwavering commitment to humanitarian
assistance in Syria. We believe that resolution 2165
(2014), which is a follow-up to resolution 2139 (2014),
includes important measures to ease humanitarian
access to people in need, as it provides for the opening
of four critical border crossings. That will enable
humanitarian actors to reach up to 2 million people who
are in hard-to-reach areas.

To conclude, Rwanda calls on the Syrian
Government, the opposition groups and all other
stakeholders to fully implement resolution 2165 (2014),
as adopted by the Council. But above all, Rwanda
believes that only a political solution will truly end
the humanitarian crisis in Syria. In that regard, we
welcome the appointment of the new Special Envoy
of the Secretary-General for Syria, Mr. Staffan de
Mistura. We hope that all actors will accord him the
necessary support in his mission. Meanwhile, we urge
those States that have influence on the parties to help
in re-animating the Geneva process, so as to find a
sustainable solution to the Syrian crisis.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

I give the floor to the representative of the Syrian
Arab Republic.
