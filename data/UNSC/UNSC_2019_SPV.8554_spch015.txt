Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
listened closely to the briefing by Prosecutor Bensouda.

China's position on the work of the International
Criminal Court (ICC) in relation to Darfur remains
unchanged. The international community should
fully respect the judicial sovereignty of the Sudan,
avoid interference in its internal affairs and heed the
legitimate demands of the Sudanese Government and
the African Union regarding the work of the ICC on
Darfur in the Sudan.

Currently the situation in Darfur has significantly
improved. We hope that the international community
will make joint efforts to provide more assistance with
a view to achieving lasting peace and security and
sustainable development in Darfur. That would serve
the common interests of the Sudan and the countries in
the region.

China is ready to work together with the
international community to play a constructive role
towards peace, stability and development in Darfur.
