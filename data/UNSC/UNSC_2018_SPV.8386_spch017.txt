Mr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): We
should like to express our thanks for the convening
of this meeting and for the briefings provided by
Ms. Rosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-General for
Political Affairs, and Ms. Ursula Mueller, Assistant
Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs.

We wish to reiterate Peru's commitment to the
independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of
Ukraine, in line with the Charter of the United Nations.
At the same time, we express our concern about the
complex and unstable situation in the east of the country,
where the civilian population continues to suffer the
consequences of the conflict. In particular, Peru shares
the concern expressed by several delegations of the
Council regarding the claimed intention of the self-
proclaimed republics to hold elections in the territories
of Luhansk and Donetsk on 11 November, which could
be detrimental to the process of dialogue between
the parties.

We believe that the scheduled elections contravene
the provisions of the Minsk agreements and the
package of measures for their implementation endorsed
by the Council, which constitute the legal basis for
achieving the political solution required to put an end
to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. We underline that
a free and fair electoral process is needed to ensure
the appointment of legitimate and representative
authorities. In that regard, we note that much of the
population of those territories - 1.5 million internally
displaced persons - have abandoned their homes, and
that those who remain - approximately 4.4 million
people out ofa total population of 6.5 million - are in
dire need of humanitarian assistance.
We conclude by stressing the importance of the
work of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe Special Monitoring Mission, and of efforts
to facilitate dialogue between the parties, in particular
the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group.
