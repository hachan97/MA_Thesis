Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): First, we would like to express our heartfelt
condolences to the bereaved families and friends of the
passengers and crew of the Malaysia Airlines flight that
crashed in Donetsk, as well as to the Governments of
the countries whose citizens were on the list of victims
of the tragedy.

An open and impartial investigation of the
incident is necessary. There must be no pressure
placed on the investigation, or attempts to prejudge
its outcome through broad statements or unfounded
allegations. Given the complexity of the situation, we
believe it would be proper to establish an international
commission under the aegis of International Civil
Aviation Organization.

I am certain that any normal person would, first and
foremost, ask the question as to what led a Ukrainian
aviation dispatcher to send a passenger flight through
an area of military clashes - an area being used to
carry out strikes against civilian targets, among others,
and where anti-aircraft systems were operating. In line
with international standards, ensuring the security of
civilian aviation in a State's airspace is that State's
responsibility. The State over whose territory a flight
is planned must provide the information necessary to
ensure the safety of aviation.

International law provides for a State's timely
ability to close off areas deemed dangerous for flights.
It would seem that an investigation is necessary not only
of the disaster, but also of the extent to which Ukrainian
aviation authorities carried out their obligations to
exercise the relevant law and did everything necessary
to ensure that Kyiv's military campaign prevented
disasters. Today Kyiv announced the full closure of its
airspace to conduct a so-called anti-terrorist operation.
Why could that not have been done earlier, instead of
waiting for there to be hundreds of victims?

During our previous meeting on Ukraine (see S/PV.7205), some Western members of the Council
talked about the restraint exercised by the Kyiv
authorities in using force. They have fully demonstrated
that "restraint" now. There have been indiscriminate
air strikes, rocket fire and attacks by artillery tanks
in Donetsk and Luhansk. This punitive operation is
becoming increasingly destructive for the civilian
population and infrastructure. Dozens of civilians have
been killed, including children. Transport systems,
community facilities and medical centres have been
destroyed.

According to data of the Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
there are more than 4.5 million people in eastern

Ukraine in the area of the clashes. However, Kyiv has
not evacuated civilians from those areas. Instead, people
must risk their lives to flee the areas of military clashes
by themselves. There are many reports of people being
intentionally targeted by the Ukrainian armed forces as
they flee the war, in particular to seek refuge in Russia.
To date, Russia has hosted more than 110,000 refugees
from eastern Ukraine. That figure continues to grow
daily. Those facts have been confirmed by UNCHR.

In that regard, six Russian regions have declared
a state of emergency. Artillery and mortar shelling by
the Ukrainian armed forces into Russian territory has
become a regular occurrence. The targets include border
crossing points and peaceful civilians. Our citizens
have been killed and wounded. We consider those
provocations acts of aggression on the part of Ukraine
against Russian citizens and against its sovereign
territory. We place all blame on the Kyiv authorities and
call for the Ukrainian side to take decisive measures to
prevent such incidents in future.

We have repeatedly issued warnings about the
danger of trying to resolve the political crisis in
Ukraine by force. We called for a mutually respectful
and inclusive dialogue among all major political forces,
Kyiv and the regions. However, the Kyiv authorities
have chosen the wrong the path at every turn, with the
support of its Western colleagues. I am talking about
the United States, of course, which pushed Kyiv to
escalate the crisis. They are trying to lay the blame on
Russia for the catastrophe caused by the course chosen.

Kyiv cast aside the agreement of 21 February and
the road map proposed by the Chair of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The
Geneva statement of 17 April and the Berlin declaration
of 2 July were also dismissed, although representatives
from the Kyiv Government took part in drafting
them. The widely acclaimed peace plan of President
Poroshenko became the pretext for military preparations
and the deployment of a large-scale punitive operation.

The Kyiv authorities have chosen to suppress
dissent. Immediately after the February uprising, Kyiv
began to call dissenters "bandits" and "terrorists", and
then "subhumans" and "insects". Was it fortuitous that
on Channel 5, the Ukrainian television channel owned
by Mr. Poroshenko, a commercial was aired showing the
stamping out of insects with a map of eastern Ukraine
in the background? Protesters have been massacred in
Mariupol and Odesa. The number of victims continues
to rise and no genuine investigation has been carried
out. Dozens of people who politically opposed Kyiv

have disappeared.

The promised reform of the Constitution is being
prepared in secret. It appears that Kyiv would like to
enlist the support of European structures and then give
it to its lucky people. Indeed, according to reports,
the redistribution of powers from the President to the
Parliament, which was the source of the fighting in
Maidan for months, is not actually being planned for. Is
it any wonder that violence has been the result of such
strategy? The political representatives of those regions
are well known. They have long been a part okaraine's
political life, and have come to the forefront through the
protest movements in recent months. Involving them in
the dialogue would prevent a further escalation of the
current serious crisis, but instead Kyiv chose to arrest,
beat and threaten them.

With regard to the Ukrainian crisis, international
institutions have not risen to the occasion. The reason
lies with our Western partners. Much has been said, but
nothing has been done to resolve the situation. We are
working hard in the OSCE. In the Security Council, the
Russian delegation proposed three times the serious
drafting of a resolution that would put an end to the
violence in Ukraine. But Western colleagues responded
to our proposals with blatant cynicism. It seems that
whatever the Ukrainian Government arbitrarily does is
judged favourably, but the victims of the geopolitical
ambitions of the Ukrainian regime are actually an
entire nation - the people of Ukraine.

The punitive operation in eastern Ukraine must be
stopped immediately. Negotiating a resolution to the
crisis is still possible, but the right choice must be made.
