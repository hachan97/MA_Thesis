Estonia acknowledges the successful work done by the United Nations Investigative Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes Committed by Da'esh/ Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (UNITAD) during the reporting period despite the challenging circumstances in the political and security sphere, as well as the coronavirus disease restrictions. We remain concerned about the recent eruption of violence in Sulaymaniyah, which endangers stability in northern Iraq. Estonia welcomes the recent renewal of UNITAD's mandate for another year. We value the continued efforts of UNITAD to contribute to ongoing accountability processes in Iraq, with full respect for the principles and best practices of the United Nations. We fully support the strategic priority of UNITAD to strengthen the capacity of Iraqi authorities and commend the significant progress made by UNITAD in collaboration with the Iraqi authorities in the identification and collection of new sources of evidence. We stress the importance of the continued work of UNITAD on issues of sexual and gender-based violence in the field of witness protection, as well as psychological support for witnesses and survivors to avoid secondary trauma, through the respective UNITAD special units.
