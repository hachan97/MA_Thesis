Mr. Mehdiyev (Azerbaijan): I should like to briefly
share with the Council the reasoning behind our vote on
resolution 2058 (2012).

Azerbaijan believes that achieving a mutually
acceptable and comprehensive settlement of the
Cyprus problem within the established United Nations
parameters is possible and within reach. Therefore,
I would like to reiterate our full support for the
Secretary-General's efforts to that end. It is clear
that the settlement can be attained only through a
results-oriented process and continued support to the
Secretary-General's good offices mission.

In our View, the resolution just adopted is
inconsistent with the Secretary-General's assessment
contained in paragraphs 4 and 43 of his report in
document S/2012/507. Thus, the Secretary-General is
of the view, inter alia, that

"a stage in the negotiation process has once again
been reached where it is incumbent on the sides to
agree to and proceed with a way forward for the
talks" (S/2012/507, para. 43).

In fact, the resolution does not place the required
emphasis on the necessity to agree on a results-oriented
process. Unfortunately, our proposed amendments
in that regard, which were supported by some other
Council members, were not heeded. Furthermore, our
proposal - again supported by some other Council
members - to ensure that the language of the preamble
reflected a sense of encouragement of the review, which
we believe is essential to ensuring that the mandate of the
United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus operates
in accordance with the developments and realities on
the ground, was not given due consideration. As a
result, according to our understanding, the resolution
just adopted significantly reduces the importance of
such a review.

For the reasons I havejust cited, Azerbaijan decided
to abstain in the voting on resolution 2058 (2012).
