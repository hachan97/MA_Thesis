Mr. Kumalo (South Africa): My delegation
wishes to welcome the President of the Republic of
Serbia, His Excellency Mr. Tadie, and the Foreign
Minister, Mr. Jeremie, to the Council. We thank
President Tadie for his briefing to this emergency
session, which we fully support. My delegation also
wishes to welcome the participation of the Secretary-
General in this meeting today.

The South African Government has taken note of
the unilateral declaration of independence by the
assembly of the Provisional Institutions of Self-
Government of the Serbian province of Kosovo. We
regret that such a step was not taken in conformity with
a legal and political process envisaged by Security
Council resolution 1244 (1999).

Throughout the debates on Kosovo, South Africa
has consistently reiterated the principle of peaceful
political dialogue in the resolution of conflicts. We
have stated that it was difficult, in the light of our own
national experience, to accept that negotiations, no
matter how difficult, could not lead to an amicable
conclusion. Even at this late hour, we still believe that
there remains space for dialogue and negotiation that
could help contribute to long-term peace in the
Balkans.

South Africa, as a Member of the United Nations,
as a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and as a
member of the African Union, upholds and promotes
the principle of the territorial integrity of States. It is
clear that the current developments in Kosovo have
serous implications for the international community.
South Africa will study their political and legal
implications.

The unilateral declaration of independence by the
Provisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo
presents the international community with a serious
challenge. In View of this, South Africa will remain
seized of this complex matter.
