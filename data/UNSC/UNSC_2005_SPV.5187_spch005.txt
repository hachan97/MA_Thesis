The President: Mr. James D. Wolfensohn,
President of the World Bank, who is unable to be in
New York this morning, will be joining us via
videolink, and we will now establish this link. I request
the technician to connect Mr. Wolfensohn with the
Security Council now. This is a novel way of doing
things. He is here on the screen now. Welcome,
Mr. Wolfensohn. I give you the floor.
