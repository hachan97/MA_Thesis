The President (spoke in Arabic): The presidency
has received requests by several delegations to make
further statements. It is my intention to accede to those
requests. However, I would ask each delegation to limit
itself to one additional statement.

I now give the floor to the representative of the
Syrian Arab Republic to make a further statement.
