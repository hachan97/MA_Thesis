The President (spoke in Russian): I should like
to remind the Council that the formula that was chosen
for the continuation of this meeting of the Security
Council was adopted at the insistent request of a
number of delegations.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Japan, who will be the last speaker at
this meeting. I invite him to take a seat at the Council
table and to make his statement.
