Mr. Ryan (Ireland): I have the honour to speak
on behalf of the European Union (EU). The acceding
countries Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia
and Slovenia, the candidate countries Bulgaria,
Romania and Turkey, the countries of the Stabilization
and Association Process and potential candidates
Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia and
Montenegro, and the European Free Trade Association
countries Iceland and Norway, members of the
European Economic Area, align themselves with this
statement.

The European Union condemns the extrajudicial
killing of Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and
seven other Palestinians by Israeli forces yesterday.
The European Union has consistently opposed
extrajudicial killings. Not only are extrajudicial
killings contrary to international law, they undermine
the concept of the rule of law, which is a key element
in the fight against terrorism.

The European Union has repeatedly condemned
the terrorist atrocities committed by Hamas, which
have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Israelis. The
EU recognizes Israel's right to protect its citizens
against terrorist attacks. Israel is entitled to do this
under international law. Israel is not, however, entitled
to carry out extrajudicial killings. Furthermore, the
assassination which has just been carried out has
inflamed the situation. The European Union calls on all
sides to exercise restraint and to refrain from acts of
violence, which will lead only to more deaths and will
put a peaceful settlement still further from reach.

Violence is no substitute for the political
negotiations which are necessary for a just and lasting
settlement. The Quartet road map remains the basis for
reaching such a settlement.
