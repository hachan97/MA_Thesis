Mr. Zhang Dianbin (China) (spoke in Chinese): China listened to the briefing delivered by
Prosecutor Bensouda.

We note that the situation in the Darfur region of
the Sudan has seen big improvements recently. China
calls on the international community to take concerted
efforts and provide more help to the Darfur region so that
it can achieve lasting peace and security and sustainable
development. That is in the common interests of the
Sudan and the countries in the region. The international
community should fully respect the legal sovereignty of
the Sudan and avoid interfering in its internal affairs. It
should also attach importance to the legitimate appeals
of the Sudanese Government and the African Union
regarding the engagement of the International Criminal
Court (ICC) on the situation in Darfur and respect the
opinions of the Sudanese Government. China is ready
to work with the international community to play a
constructive role in achieving peace, stability and
development in the Darfur region. China's position on
the engagement of the ICC on the situation in Darfur
remains unchanged.
