The President: I thank the Special
Representative for his comments. I wish to repeat that
we are also thankful to His Excellency Mr. Zalmai
Rassoul, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Islamic
Republic of Afghanistan, for his participation in
today's meeting, as well as for his insightful statement.
We wish him all success.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 1.30 p.m.
