Mr. Verbeke (Belgium) (spoke in French):
Belgium regrets that the draft resolution submitted to
us was not adopted. Belgium feels that the Security
Council is legitimately seized of the question of
Myanmar.

Belgium's fundamental objective in voting in
favour of the draft resolution was to support the
Secretary-General's efforts. Indeed, Belgium believes
that the draft resolution contained all the elements
necessary to supporting his good offices. The draft
resolution would, on the one hand, have allowed for a
clear presentation to the Burmese Government of the
expectations of the Security Council and the
international community, especially with respect to the
resumption of a political dialogue extending to all
political parties; on the other hand, it would have
identified practices to be corrected, including the
violent repression of minorities, the eradication of
forced labour, and the release of political prisoners.

My Government believes that the draft resolution
is a necessary appeal to the Government of Myanmar
to respond constructively to the Secretary-General's
proposals. It is essential that the Secretary-General's
good offices and dialogue continue in the interests of
the people of Myanmar and of international peace and
security.
