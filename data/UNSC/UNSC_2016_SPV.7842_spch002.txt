Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian delegation has often expressed
its concern over the unacceptable delays in the judicial
proceedings of the International Tribunal for the
Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the prolongation of its
work beyond the limits set by resolution 1966 (2010).
Our opinion of that has not changed.

At the same time, we note that the Tribunal's new
leadership has managed to avoid additional delays, for
the first time in several years. The adoption today of
resolution 2329 (2016) reflects the commitment of the
ICTY to the task of finalizing its work by the end of
2017 and contains important provisions ensuring that
the current extension of the mandates of the judges and
prosecutors will be the last. Those conditions form the
basis of our decision to vote in favour of the resolution.

I would like to stress that the Council's appeals to
the Tribunal to shorten the ongoing judicial proceedings
are as urgent as ever, and we hope that the Tribunal's
leadership will make every effort to that end in order to
ensure that the two remaining cases are finalized even
before the official deadline.
