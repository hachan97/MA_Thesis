Mr. Al Nafisee (Saudi Arabia): At the outset, I
would like to express our appreciation to the Ugandan
presidency of the Council for organizing this open
debate on the situation in the Middle East, including
the Palestinian question, and to thank the Assistant
Secretary-General for his comprehensive briefing on
this issue.

No regional crisis has greater potential to affect
other regional conflicts than the Arab-Israeli conflict in
Middle East. It has overshadowed and dominated all
other issues in the Middle East for the past six decades.
This situation has created a climate conducive to the
development of extremism and the spread of terrorism,
while hampering regional development, modernization
and reform.

Saudi Arabia, along with other Arab
Governments, has made its commitment to peace loud
and clear in the Arab Peace Initiative. We have
continued to affirm our commitment to a just and
comprehensive peace based on international law.

Unfortunately, on the other side, no reciprocal
commitment has yet been forthcoming from Israel. It is
very crucial to stress the importance of reviving the
peace process and Israeli seriousness and truthfulness
towards the peace process, including the immediate
cessation of the building of settlements or their
expansion.

The status quo in the situation in the city of Gaza
is another factor exacerbating the problem in that
besieged city. The call on Israel to withdraw its forces
from all occupied lands, including the Golan in Syria
and the Sheba'a farm lands and Kafr Shouba in
Lebanon, must go hand-in-hand with the overall peace
plan in the region.

Saudi Arabia welcomes the effort of President
Obama's Administration to push for a comprehensive
peace plan and the establishment of a sovereign State
for the Palestinian people, living side-by-side with the
State of Israel.
