The President: I wish to advise all speakers to
limit their statements to no more than four minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with longer statements are
requested to circulate the texts in writing and deliver a
condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.

I give the floor to the representative of Brazil.
