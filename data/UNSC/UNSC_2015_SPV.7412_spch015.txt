Mr. Gombo (Chad) (spoke in French): I would
like to thank the Chair of the Committee established
pursuant to resolution 1737 (2006), Ambassador Roman
Oyarzun Marchesi, for the 90-day report that covers the
period from 18 December 2014 to 23 March 2015 on
the activities of the Committee. Chad takes note of the
report and encourages the Committee to continue its
activities.

Concerning the Iranian nuclear issue, we welcome
the talks between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the
States members of the P5+1 on the basis of the Joint
Plan of Action. We note with regret that previous
negotiations did not end in a definitive agreement.
Nevertheless, we support the negotiations and call
for all parties to be reasonable and come to a political
solution as soon as possible. Chad is a peace-loving
country and hopes that the diplomatic and political
negotiations will achieve a definitive solution. We hope
that the bilateral negotiations to be held in Lausanne,
Switzerland, through 31 March will finally enable a
solid agreement to be reached.

Chad recognizes the Islamic Republic of Iran's
right to develop a civilian nuclear programme, and once
an agreement has been concluded, the sanctions should
be lifted. The Islamic Republic of Iran insists that its
nuclear activities are peaceful. In addition, it maintains
that it is not engaged in a nuclear arms race because,
according to Iran, such weapons are contrary to its way
of life and its philosophy.

To conclude, I would like to congratulate Mr. Roman
Oyarzun Marchesi for his leadership of the 1737
Committee and to wish him good luck over the next two
years. I also hope for full success in the negotiations
under way for a peaceful and negotiated solution to the
Iranian nuclear issue with a view to lifting sanctions.
