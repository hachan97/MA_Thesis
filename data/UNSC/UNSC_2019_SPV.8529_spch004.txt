Mr. Cohen (United States of America): As we have
made clear to other members of the Council, we, like
France and Germany, do not see a need for this briefing.
In our View, Russia's request for this meeting is a clear
attempt to distract from the peaceful, democratic
transfer of power happening today in Ukraine. The
United States congratulates Mr. Zelensky on his
inauguration today as President of Ukraine. We look
forward to working with him and welcome his express
commitment to promoting national unity. Accordingly,
the United Statesjoins our colleagues in urging Council
members to vote against the adoption of this agenda.
