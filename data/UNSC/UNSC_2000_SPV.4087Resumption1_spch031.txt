The President: We note, Mr. Ambassador, your
comment that your Government is considering additional
support of the Joint United Nations Programme on
HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).
We have now reached the mid-point in the list of
speakers, which does not necessarily mean the mid-point
in terms of time. But this is an appropriate time for me to
invite the Surgeon-General of the United States to take a
seat at the Council table and to make some very brief
comments before he has to return to Washington.
