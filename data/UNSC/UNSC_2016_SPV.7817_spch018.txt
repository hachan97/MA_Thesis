Mr. Shen B0 (China) (spoke in Chinese): I should
like at the outset to thank Under-Secretary-General
O'Brien and Ms. Hoff, the representative of the World
Health Organization, for their briefings.

The humanitarian situation in some areas of Syria,
including in Aleppo, is very serious, leading to massive
civilian casualties and including attacks on civilian
and health-care facilities. China condemns any attack
against civilians or humanitarian infrastructure. We
truly empathize with the Syrian people's suffering. We
urge all parties in Syria to assist with the relief efforts
of the international community by providing full
humanitarian access so as to ensure the timely and safe
delivery of humanitarian assistance.

The international community should also work
jointly to take expeditious action to ease tensions so as
to create conditions conducive to the implementation
of humanitarian assistance and the promotion of a
political settlement of the issue.

In working to mitigate the humanitarian situation,
we should not overlook the need to combat terrorism.
Terrorists and terrorist organizations inside Syria
are launching repeated attacks, gravely hampering
humanitarian efforts. The international community
must strengthen its coordination, follow uniform
standards and resolutely combat all Council-listed
terrorist organizations.

A political settlement is the only viable way
to resolve the Syrian issue, and the international
community should stay the course in that respect. Any
action taken by the Council on the issue of Syria should
truly improve the situation there and be genuinely
beneficial to the promotion of the political process, to
advancing humanitarian relief efforts and to efforts to
combat terrorism. China will continue to support the
mediation efforts of Special Envoy De Mistura.
