The President (interpretation from Russian): I thank
the representative of Canada for the kind words he
addressed to me.

It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements before the voting.
