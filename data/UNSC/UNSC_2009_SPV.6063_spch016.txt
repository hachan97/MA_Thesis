Mr. Takasu (Japan): Japan was pleased to join in
the adoption of resolution 1860 (2009), which we
believe will contribute to the cessation of violence in
and around the Gaza Strip. We consider it important
that the Security Council was able to discharge its
heavy responsibility by taking, with the broadest
political support, a formal decision on the grave and
serious situation in Gaza, after intensive consultations
over the past few days.

We applaud in particular the tireless efforts and
leadership of Arab foreign ministers and the foreign
ministers of France, the United Kingdom and the
United States of America, which made it possible to
achieve this important outcome.

The resolution above all stresses the urgency of
the situation and calls for an immediate, durable and
fully respected ceasefire. It also calls for the
unimpeded provision and distribution of humanitarian
assistance.

In the meantime, we were shocked to hear today
about a tragic incident - an attack against a United
Nations vehicle, killing United Nations Relief and
Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East
(UNRWA) contract workers and injuring others and
forcing UNRWA to suspend its operations. We extend
our deepest condolences to their families.

This incident, along with other similar incidents,
underlines the need for the ceasefire to be put in place
immediately and permanently. The calls for a ceasefire,
humanitarian assistance and intensified efforts for
arrangements and guarantees for a ceasefire in Gaza, as
contained in the resolution, must be heeded and
implemented immediately and faithfully by all
concerned in order to stop the cycle of violence and
restore calm, normalcy and safe living conditions in
and around Gaza.

Japan hopes that this resolution will help create
conditions to renew efforts for putting the peace
process back on track, in accordance with the
principles laid out in resolution 1850 (2008) to achieve
a comprehensive, just and lasting peace.
