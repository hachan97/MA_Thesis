The President (spoke in French): I thank Sir
Kieran Prendergast very much for his briefing, which,
in describing the overall situation in Somalia and the
context in which the Conference undertaken on the
excellent initiative of the President of Djibouti is
taking place, was a perfect introduction to our debate.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
Permanent Representative of Djibouti. I invite him to
take a seat at the Council table and to make his
statement.
