The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received letters from the representatives of Haiti
and Venezuela, in which they request to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's
agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose,
with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Lelong (Haiti)
took a seat at the Council table; Mr. Bivero

(Venezuela) took the seat reserved for him at the side
of the Council Chamber.

The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them two reports
of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Civilian
Police Mission in Haiti, documents 5/1999/908 and
S/l999/1184.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/1999/ 1202, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France,
the United States of America and Venezuela.

I give the floor to the representative of Haiti.
