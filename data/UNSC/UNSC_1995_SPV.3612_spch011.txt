Mr. Qin Huasun (China) (interpretation from Chinese): Like other delegations, the Chinese delegation is
deeply concerned about, and condemns, the violations of
international humanitarian law in the region of the former
Yugoslavia. We urge the parties concerned to immediately
stop such activities and cooperate with international
humanitarian organizations to find out the truth. We also
hope that the parties concerned will maintain the peace
momentum and create favourable conditions for genuine
and lasting peace and stability in the region.

Based on this position, the Chinese delegation will
vote in favour of the draft resolution before us.

I wish to point out here that in dealing with the
violations of international humanitarian law in the region
the Council should distinguish its purview from that of
other bodies and refrain from intervening in what falls
within the purview of others. We have noted that some
elements in the draft resolution before us should be dealt
with by the International Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia or other related United Nations bodies, and we
express our reservation on those elements.
