Mrs. Martinic (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish):
Argentina thanks Egypt for organizing this open
debate on a topic to which Argentina attaches
particular importance, given its triple status as a
troop- and police-contributing country to United
Nations peace missions, an active promoter of the
concept of sustainable peace and current member of the
Peacebuilding Commission (PBC). We also thank the
Deputy Secretary-General and the other speakers for
their briefings to the Security Council this morning.

From the outset, Argentina has embraced the
Organization's new emphasis on conflict prevention,
as well as the development of the concept of
sustainable peace or sustaining peace. In that context,
peacekeeping operations (PKOs) have acquired new
potential in the continuum of responses associated
with prevention, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. The
development of PKOs in the broad area of sustainable
peace is the last step of the evolution initiated in the
1990s, when new complex multidimensional missions
were added to traditional missions, as reflected in their
mandates, as a result of an ever-increasing number
of factors linked to peacebuilding - in particular in
the area of the promotion and protection of human
rights, the rebuilding of rule-of-law institutions and the
consolidation of democracy.

In that regard, Argentina believes that this has been
one of the most notable developments in peace missions
in recent years and is essential in order to avoid relapse
into conflict and to enable missions to act as a platform
for sustainable development. That trend has led to
peacekeepers becoming early peacebuilders, which
has been acknowledged by the General Assembly's
Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations since
the beginning of the decade, as reflected in its annual
report, and by the Security Council in resolution 2086
(2013) - which Argentina had the honour to negotiate
and co-sponsor in its last action as a non-permanent
member of this organ.

More recently, and on the basis of the report of
the Advisory Group of Experts on the Review of the
Peacebuilding Architecture, chaired by Ambassador
Gert Rosenthal (S/2015/490), the substantially identical,
parallel General Assembly resolution 70/262 and
Security Council resolution 2282 (2016) on the review
of the peacebuilding architecture have assigned PKOs
and special political missions a prominent role in the
comprehensive strategy for peacekeeping.

The new narrative of sustainable peace involves
redefining the Organization's peace operations, putting
greater emphasis on prevention and taking special note
of the fact that such missions constitute a political
instrument to be used in the framework of processes
aimed at sustaining peace before, during and after
conflict. In that regard, Argentina reiterates - in
line with the aforementioned parallel resolutions of
the Assembly and the Council - the need to seek,
on a regular basis, the specific advice and input of
the Peacebuilding Commission, harnessing thereby
that body's more long-term perspective and vision,
which is essential for our efforts to properly reflect
sustaining peace when it comes to establishing,
reviewing and ultimately drawing down peacekeeping
operations, as well as in setting the mandates of special
political missions.

In particular, we must work to guarantee that
transitions from one mission to another or to a country
teams proceed in such a way that sustaining peace
is neither disrupted or weakened. To that end, it is
important to ensure the continuity and stability of
peacebuilding programmes, personnel and resources
during the various stages of United Nations activities
in host countries, always in close consultation and
coordination with those countries. In this regard,
Argentina recognizes the example of the Joint Transition
Plan ofthe United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti
(MINUSTAH) and the United Nations country team
in Haiti, which describes the gaps in peacebuilding
arising from the withdrawal of MINUSTAH and
which will make it necessary for the new mission, the
United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti,
the country team and the donor community continue to
provide support. We are also confident that the second
special political mission to verify the peace process in
Colombia will continue to support the country on its
path to sustainable peace.

With respect to the particular issue of sufficient
funding for peacebuilding activities by United Nations
country teams and for peacebuilding components of
peace operations, including during the transition and
reduction stages of the missions, Argentina looks
forward to receiving the options that the Secretary-
General will present in his report prior to the high-
level meeting on peacekeeping and peacebuilding
to be held during the seventy-second session of the
General Assembly.

Finally, in line with the parallel resolutions of
the Assembly and the Council on sustainable peace,
Argentina reiterates the need for greater coordination,
coherence and integration in the peacebuilding tasks
of peacekeeping operations, country teams and
national and international development actors, in
order to ensure greater effectiveness and efficiency in
their implementation.
