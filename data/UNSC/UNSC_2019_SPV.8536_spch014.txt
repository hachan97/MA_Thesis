Mr. Hickey (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom welcomes today's adoption of resolution 2471
(2019). As a member of the troika, we stand firm in our
support for peace in South Sudan and for the progress
made to date, especially efforts from the region led by the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development to ensure
that the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the
Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan continues to
reduce violence. There is still, however, work to do,
and we urge the parties to work together for the sake of
their people.

We in the Security Council have this morning
demonstrated to the people of South Sudan the we are
committed to bringing an end to their suffering. The
Council will not allow those who seek to undermine
peace to do so with impunity, nor will we support the
free flow of weapons into the country while that peace
remains so fragile.

We share the disappointments of others in the
Council today that some members of the Council were
not able to support the renewal of the sanctions and the
arms embargo. Peace in South Sudan remains fragile.
In the place of a complete judicial infrastructure,
sanctions offer a form of accountability, and they send
a message that heinous acts of violence will not be
tolerated by the international community. On the arms
embargo, with the peace deal only recently extended,
for the Council to allow an unhindered flow of arms into
the country right now would surely be irresponsible and
risk fuelling further violence. It would send a terrible
signal to people of South Sudan.
