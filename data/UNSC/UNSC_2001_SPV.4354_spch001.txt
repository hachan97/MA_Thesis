The President (spoke in Chinese): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon, document 8/2001/714.
Members of the Council also have before them
document 8/2001/748, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of the members
of the Council to a letter dated 26 July 2001 from the
Permanent Representative of Lebanon to the United
Nations addressed to the President of the Security
Council, document S/2001/734.

It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
before it. If I hear no objection, I shall now put the
draft resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

A vote was taken by Show ofhana's.

In favour:
Bangladesh, China, Colombia, France, Ireland,
Jamaica, Mali, Mauritius, Norway, Russian
Federation, Singapore, Tunisia, Ukraine, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America

The President (spoke in Chinese): There were
15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 1365 (2001).

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Council will remain seized of the matter.

This has probably been the last meeting of the
month. I should like to thank all the members of the
Council for their support, cooperation and friendly
spirit. I take this opportunity to thank the Secretary-
General and the members of the Secretariat for their
valuable help and assistance.

The meeting rose at 11.15 am.
