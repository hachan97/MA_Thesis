Mr. Shen Guofang (China) (interpretation from Chinese): The peace process in Angola has lasted for
several years. Most of the tasks contained in the Lusaka
Protocol have been completed through the untiring efforts
by all parties, especially the Government and people of
Angola. There is finally hope that peace can be realized in
Angola. The Chinese Government is deeply encouraged by
this development.

The draft resolution before us once again urges
UNITA to take effective measures to fulfil its obligations
so as to bring about the normalization of national
administration throughout Angola as soon as possible. To
ensure the smooth realization of this goal, the Chinese
delegation is in favour of extending the mandate of the
United Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA)
until 30 June and calls on the parties concerned effectively
to guarantee the safety of MONUA personnel. We are
deeply concerned at the attacks carried out by UNITA
personnel against MONUA and hope that such incidents
will not recur in the future.

China endorses the recommendation of the Secretary-
General on the phasing out of military personnel from
Angola.

The international community and international
financial institutions should provide more assistance in the
post-conflict peace-building of Angola.

We should carefully listen to and respect the views
of the Angolan Government on the future presence, size
and organizational structure of MONUA, as well as the
future presence and functions of the United Nations in
Angola. In this regard, we look forward to the
recommendations of the Secretary-General to be
submitted to the Security Council after consultations with
the Angolan Government.

In View of these considerations, my delegation will
vote in favour of the draft resolution.
