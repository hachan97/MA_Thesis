At a time when peace missions in French-speaking countries and regions are more important than ever, it is important to have transregional organizations that we can rely on. I welcome the work done by the International Organization of la Francophonie (OIF) in recent years to significantly advance the participation of uniformed personnel from francophone countries in peacekeeping operations. Those efforts are essential to building trust between the populations and the troops mobilized on the ground, given that nearly two thirds of currently active peacekeeping operations are deployed in OIF States, and therefore facilitating peace-building actions. At the same time, we are also making the Security Council more inclusive, given that the International Organization of la Francophonie today brings together 88 States and Governments and more than 300 million speakers. Following the example of our French friends who integrate French-speaking countries into the European Union through regular exchanges, we could consider a similar approach in the Security Council in order to maintain a constant dialogue on our subjects of common interest, including gender equality, peace and sustainable development. Like France, Germany supports multilateralism and multilingualism, and although we are not a member of the OIF, we give them our full support.
