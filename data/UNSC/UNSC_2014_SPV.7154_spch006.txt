Ms. Power (United States of America): The human
stakes of what is happening in Ukraine are extremely
high. The lives of innocent civilians are at risk, yet
we are being bombarded by Russian disinformation
and propaganda, while the Ukrainians are being
confronted by incitement and violence. Russian media
and Government spokespersons are spreading fiction,
so we must tonight focus on facts.

The Council has heard, these last weeks, Russia
disclaim any intention of occupying or invading.
The Council has heard it publicly, and we have heard
it privately. Unfortunately, the fact is that the armed
seizure of buildings in six eastern Ukrainian towns
yesterday, and several more today, mirrors the tactics
Russian forces used in the early stages of the Crimea
invasion. Then, too, officials from the Russian
Federation spoke early on in the crisis and disclaimed
any intention of occupying or invading. In the earlier
Crimean case, highly organized, well-equipped and
professional forces wearing Russian military uniforms
and military gear without identifying insignia moved
in first to take control of Crimean Government and
security facilities, before being later replaced by regular
Russian military forces. Then, too, Russia said it was
acting to protect minorities' rights. But the whole world
now knows that they were not. As the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe has reported, the
minorities at risk in Crimea are Tatars and Ukrainians.

The Council has heard that there are no Russian
troops in eastern Ukraine, but the fact is that many
of the armed units that we have seen were outfitted
in bullet-proof vests and camouflage uniforms with
insignia removed. Those armed units, some wearing
black and orange Saint George's ribbons - associated
with Russian Victory Day celebrations - raised
Russian and separatist flags over seized buildings and
have called for referendums and union with Russia. We
know who is behind that; indeed, the only entity in the
area capable of those coordinated, professional military
actions is Russia.

The synchronized surgical seizure of buildings
yesterday occurred in towns along the main highway,
followed by armed roadblocks, almost as ifa coordinated
barrier were being formed between Kyiv and the major
eastern cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. The Council
does not have to take my word for it - or even that of
the Ukrainian Government - it need only witness for
itself the videos of professional military shepherding
thugs into a building in Kramatorsk; the photographs
showing the so-called concerned citizens taking over
Sloviansk, equipped exactly like the elite troops that
took Crimea; or the video of a military operation in
Krasny Liman by armed men with the same equipment.

The Council has heard laments about instability, as
ifinstability were organic. But the fact is that this is the
saddest kind of instability: it is completely man-made.
This instability was written and choreographed in and
by Russia.

We continue efforts to de-escalate the situation in
Ukraine and find a diplomatic path forward, which is
why Secretary Kerry will participate in the Geneva
talks on 17 April, which will include Russian Foreign
Minister Lavrov. But ifthose are to be successful, Russia
will have to explain why its forces continue to mass on
the Ukrainian border - at least 40,000 forces - and
it will have to come with constructive ideas on how to
de-escalate and resolve the armed attacks on buildings
in eastern Ukraine.

The United States stands with Ukraine and the
fundamental principle that the future of Ukraine must
be decided by the Ukrainian people. We also stand
with international law and norms and the fundamental
principle that borders are not suggestions. On Monday,
we will conclude the $1 billion loan guarantee for
Ukraine. That will benefit all the Ukrainian people,
including minorities. Next week, Vice-President Biden
will visit Ukraine. We strongly support concluding
the agreement between Ukraine and the International
Monetary Fund so that the international community
can bolster Ukraine's economy. And we will support in
every way we can Ukraine's elections at the end of May
so that Ukraine can advance its political transition and
look to a peaceful future.
