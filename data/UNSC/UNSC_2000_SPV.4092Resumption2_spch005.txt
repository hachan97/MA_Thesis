other representatives who have come here for this
extraordinary meeting.

I also want to thank the representative of Egypt for
announcing that he, too, will circulate his statement. I
consider this a great act of friendship in the interests of
our effort, particularly coming from a country of such
enormous importance to all of us in Africa and around the
world.
