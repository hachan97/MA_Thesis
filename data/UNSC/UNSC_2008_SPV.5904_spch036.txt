Mr. Brammertz (spoke in French): I thank those
present for their comments, most of which were
encouraging, some of which were critical. I would like
to thank them for emphasizing the need for cooperation
by the countries of the region and by the international
community.

I would state once again our determination to
implement the Security Council resolutions on the
completion strategy. The Tribunal President referred to
that. The Tribunal has referred a number of cases,
under rule 11 bis, to the region, and no other referrals
are being planned. In fact, as recently as last week,
decisions were handed down in these cases by
jurisdictions in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Croatia.
I would like to emphasize in this context that we
are daily contact with prosecutors in the region to
transfer to their files of investigative material. I should
like, if I may, to encourage Council members and the
entire international community to provide further
support for the work of prosecutors in the region. They
are doing outstanding work in political conditions that
remain difficult and with resources that are often
insufficient.
