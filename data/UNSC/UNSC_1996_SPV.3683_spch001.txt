The President (interpretation from French): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Colombia, Cuba, the Lao People's
Democratic Republic and Viet Nam, in which they request
to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice,
I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Alarcdn de
Quesada (Cuba) took a seat at the Council table; Mr.
Garcia (Colombia), Mr. Kittikhoun (Lao People's Democratic Republic) and Mr. Ngo Quang Xuan (Viet Nam) took the seats reserved for them at the side of
the Council Chamber.

The President (interpretation from French): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on the agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the note by
the Secretary-General dated 1 July 1996 (S/ 1996/509),
transmitting the letter dated 28 June 1996 from the
President of the Council of the International Civil Aviation
Organization addressed to the Secretary-General.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/1996/596, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by the United States of America.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to the following other documents: S/ 1996/ 152,
letter dated 1 March 1996 from the Permanent
Representative of Cuba to the United Nations addressed to
