Mr. Andjaba (Namibia): I will be very brief in
order not to delay the departure of Ms. McAskie.

I thought this afternoon's discussion and briefing
were very useful. I wish once again to thank Ms.
McAskie for that, and for providing additional
information in response to the questions and comments
of members of the Council.

But, Mr. President, the usefulness of this meeting
has been disturbed, to say the least, by what you said in
your national capacity. I believe that you can distort
whatever you want to distort, but the reality on the
ground remains as it is. There is aggression against the
Democratic Republic of the Congo. That is a fact; you
cannot change it. There are invited forces in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and there are
forces there that were not invited. That is a fact, and
you cannot change it, even if you want to. Security
Council resolutions are very clear on this matter. They
make a clear distinction between invited and uninvited
forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is
therefore incomprehensible to hear you time and again
trying to defend the aggressors instead of defending the
victim. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is a
victim of aggression. That is clear.

My delegation is flabbergasted by the way in
which your delegation and you personally, Mr.
President, have been approaching this issue. I did not
intend to say this, but I have the right to respond to
what you said in your national capacity. Again, that
there are invited and uninvited forces in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo is a fact that you
may wish to distort, but your distortion will not change
the reality.

I promised to be brief, and I have been brief. I
reserve the right to come back again if you so wish,
Mr. President. I am ready to spend more time in this
meeting if you wish.
