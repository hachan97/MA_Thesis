Mr. Alkatiri: I do not really want to respond; I
just want to offer some conclusions.

We came to this meeting from very far with many
preoccupations. The expectations of our people are
increasingly great, and now we are faced with another
type of expectation: the international community's
expectations of us. But we think that the support we are
receiving here will give us much more energy,
creativity and, of course, strength to face all these
challenges and expectations. Without the Council's
support it will be very difficult for us to do it, but with
this kind of sympathy and support surely the East
Timorese people, their Government and the United
Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor will
really make possible the impossible, and we will do our
best to have a democratic country, a stable country and
a peaceful country in that region.
