Mr. Ben Mustapha (Tunisia) (spoke in French):
Mr. President, I am very grateful to you for having
given me the honour of making a short statement
during this meeting. Permit me to take this opportunity
to reiterate the deep appreciation of our delegation for
your having organized this series of meetings between
the Security Council and the Political Committee for
the Implementation of the Lusaka Ceasefire
Agreement. These meetings have been of great
importance. They have been a success and I
congratulate you for them. My country hopes that this
partnership will develop and lead to peace, security and
stability in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and
in the region.

The deployment of the United Nations
Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (MONUC) is of capital importance for the
implementation of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement.
Tunisia has shown its commitment to the Agreement
through its contribution to MONUC. The Tunisian
military observers are in place. We have placed a
support unit at the disposition of MONUC, at its
headquarters.

As we are about to adopt this important draft
resolution, which will make it possible to effectively
implement phase 2 of the deployment of MONUC
while consolidating the first phase, I would like to
announce that that Tunisian unit is ready and is
awaiting its departure. If the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations says that it is ready, we can
make this departure coincide with the celebration of the
fortieth anniversary of the independence of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, next 30 June.
