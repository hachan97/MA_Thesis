Mr. Shen Guofang (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
will vote in favour of the draft resolution, because we have
always believed that the implementation of the oil-for-food
programme is conducive to improving the humanitarian
situation in Iraq and to easing the unjustifiable sufferings of
the Iraqi civilians living under sanctions. We have always
believed, too, that pending the lifting of sanctions against
Iraq, the elements of the programme should be further
enhanced and improved in the light of the specific situation
so as to make it more effective.

Meanwhile, I also wish to emphasize that the Security
Council's technical extension of the oil-for-food programme
and its consideration of the new omnibus draft resolution
are two separate matters, and are not directly linked. We
hope that the Security Council will adopt a new draft
resolution on Iraq as soon as possible, on the basis of
consensus.
