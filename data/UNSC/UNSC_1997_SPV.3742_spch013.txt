Mr. Berrocal Soto (Costa Rica) (interpretation from Spanish): The Government of Costa Rica associates itself
with the words of solidarity and sorrow conveyed by the
Security Council to the people and the Government of
China on the death of their leader, Mr. Deng Xiaoping.
Mr. Deng Xiaoping's extraordinary leadership led to a
remarkable period of change and reform that brought well-
being and an enormous improvement in the standard of
living of the people of China. A few years before the end
of the century, China is now one of the essential
protagonists in the coming world of the twenty-first
century. This is due in large measure to the ideas, vision
and leadership of Mr. Deng Xiaoping.

My Government and the people of Costa Rica reiterate
their sincerest and most profound condolences to the people
and the Government of China.
