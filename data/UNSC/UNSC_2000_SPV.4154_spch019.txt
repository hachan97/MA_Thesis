Mr. Klein: Let me deal with the statement made
in serial fashion. Regarding our time lines, I think we
have laid out clear and specific goals, which we believe
can be met. I assure the Council that I will do my
utmost to bring this mission to closure on time and
under budget in terms of the mandate.

With regard to trafficking, I think the Council can
take some pleasure in knowing that the United Nations
was the first to identify this problem. Since Bosnia and
Herzegovina has more than 430 border crossings
mountain paths, dirt roads and two-lane highways we
have a totally permeable State. We identified the
problem, we began to raid the houses and we worked
with local ambassadors to return the women to their
homes. We worked with the International Office of
Migration to ensure that when the women do return to
their countries of origin, counselling and reintegration
will be available to them. We temporarily funded safe
houses, and we are now in the process of funding
permanent housing for them as safe houses.

The report is available. It was written in
conjunction with our colleagues in the human rights
arena, and I think it very much addresses a strongly
perceived need.

I thank all members for their very generous
comments; I will take them back with me. As I said
earlier, of the 15 countries represented around this
table, 13 are represented in my mission, along with 60
other nationalities. This means that the United Nations
Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the
International Police Task Force include 73 different
nationalities. These are your citizens; they are men and
women from your countries who every day
demonstrate on the ground that peoples of different
races, religions and ethnic groups can work together
constructively in a common cause. Those are the
universal values of the United Nations, which we all
represent.
