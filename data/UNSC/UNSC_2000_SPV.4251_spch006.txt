Sir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): For
more than a year now the Taliban have continued to
ignore the demand of the Security Council in
resolution 1267 (1999) to hand over Usama bin Laden.
They have also continued their support for
international terrorism and their provision of safe
haven and training facilities for terrorists in the
territory under their control. This cannot be tolerated
by the international community. It is therefore
appropriate that the Council should respond by
imposing further measures against the Taliban.

The draft resolution which the Council is about to
adopt is carefully targeted to ensure that it will exert
pressure exclusively on the Taliban and on Usama bin
Laden and his associates. The Council has taken great
care in designing the draft resolution to ensure that the
measures imposed will not have an adverse impact on
ordinary Afghans, who have suffered for far too long
already. We call on the Taliban to allow aid agencies
and international organizations to carry on their vital
work in safety and without hindrance. The action taken
by the Council today should have no bearing on the
activities of those providing aid to the Afghan people.

I would like to conclude by calling on the Taliban
to comply urgently with the demands of the Council in
the draft resolution we are about to adopt and in
resolution 1267 (1999) so that the measures decided on
today may not have to be applied. This would be in
their own interests, and it would also be very much in
the interests of neighbouring countries, the wider
international community and the Afghan people as a
whole.
