Mr. Cabral (Portugal): Portugal has always been
supportive of the African Union's efforts in Somalia.
Within the European Union, we have consistently
supported the financing requests for the African Union
Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) through the African
Peace Facility. As members of the Council, we have
constructively engaged to address the African Union's
concerns and AMISOM's needs. It is in this same
constructive spirit that we have once more voted in
favour of strengthening the African Union Mission in
Somalia.

We feel nevertheless that it is important to bear in
mind, as the Secretary-General acknowledges in his
latest report on Somalia (S/2012/74), the current
environment of global financial constraint, to which
the United Nations peacekeeping budget is not
immune. Hence, it is imperative to seek additional
funding for AMISOM. and to broaden its international
donor base. The forthcoming London conference
should be instrumental in that regard. Moreover, the
additional efforts that we are all willing to make at the
security and military levels - and in that regard allow
me to commend the hard work and sacrifices of
3
AMISOM's regional partners and of the Somali
security forces - should be accompanied by a serious
commitment on the part of the Somali political leaders
to the political process.

Portugal takes note of the recent agreement of the
second set of Garowe Principles on federalism, system
of Government and ending the transition by
operationalizing the first set of Garowe Principles, and
we take this opportunity to urge the Transitional
Federal Institutions and all road map signatories to
redouble their efforts. Turning those decisions into
reality is another significant step that the Somalis
themselves need to take towards a stable and viable
State that will pave the way for a better future for the
Somali people.
