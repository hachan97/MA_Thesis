Mr. Wilson (United Kingdom): This evening we
have sent a clear and unanimous message. It is time for the
Government of Burundi to live up to the commitments
President Nkurunziza made to the Secretary-General,
to the international community and, most important,
to the people of Burundi themselves. That means that
the Government of Burundi must commit fully to the
mediated dialogue and that the Government must show
its firm commitment by agreeing to a timetable and a
participants list for genuine and inclusive talks.

Support from the United Nations will be critical
if the talks are to succeed. We therefore support the
strengthening of Special Adviser Benomar's team to
buttress the mediated dialogue. But let me be clear:
President Nkurunziza needs to commit to working with
the United Nations, and he needs to let Mr. Benomar's
team provide the technical support that is so vital to
the success of genuine dialogue. Such support is not
unconditional. The Council and Mr. Benomar need
to be clear that the United Nations will not support a
Government that habitually commits human rights
violations against its own people.

We have sent a clear message today. Through this
resolution we have provided valuable tools to help
deliver the peace and stability that the citizens of
Burundi deserve. Let us now work together to secure
that outcome.
