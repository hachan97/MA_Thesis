Mr. Escalante Hasbl'in (El Salvador) (spoke in Spanish): I am pleased to see the representative of a
friendly country presiding over the Security Council
this month. I also welcome the Minister of the People's
Power for Foreign Affairs of the Bolivarian Republic
of Venezuela.
My delegation wishes to reiterate before this forum
what was previously expressed on the occasion of the
debate held on 26 January (see S/PV.8452), exactly a
month ago, and to express its deep concern about the
recent events in the brother country of Venezuela,
which has not been able to find a peaceful way to
address the differences among the parties involved.
Worse still, these actions are fuelling an ongoing
political confrontation that is affecting the stability and
development of the Venezuelan people.

Once again, we reiterate our conviction that it is
up to the Government and other internal Venezuelan
political forces to resolve all differences through
dialogue conducted by the Venezuelans themselves,
peacefully and within the framework of the Constitution
and international law, supported by political and
diplomatic means, without the use or threat of the use
of force.

El Salvador, as a responsible State, calls on the
international community to guarantee full respect for
the principles of the Charter of the United Nations,
including, as we all know, respect for the sovereignty
of States, non-intervention in internal affairs and the
prohibition of the use or threat of use force. As members
of the international community, we must therefore
advocate for a peaceful solution through dialogue, as the
best way to contribute to overcoming any difficulties
that Venezuela may face and to contribute thereby to
lasting solutions and regional peace.

Finally, the Government of El Salvador expresses
once again its support for the diplomatic initiative of
those countries that, committed to peace and stability
in the region, promote and hope to contribute to finding
a political and peaceful solution to the differences
in Venezuela.
