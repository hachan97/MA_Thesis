Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): Since
the adoption of resolution 2118 (2013) in September
2013, many welcome steps of been taken to destroy the
Syrian regime's chemical-weapon stockpile. Yet nearly
18 months on, we are will still faced with the persistent

credible reports of chemical-weapon use.
The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons (OPCW) fact-finding mission concluded
last December with a high degree of confidence that
chlorine gas had been systematically used as a weapon.
It also noted witness reports that these attacks were
carried out by helicopter, which means carried out by the
regime. We cannot accept this as a "business as usual".
The use of chemical weapons presents a clear threat to
international peace and security. it is a must exactly
100 years since the first recorded use of chlorine as a
weapon of war, in April 1915. It was horrific then and it
is totally unacceptable in the twenty-first century. We
cannot change the past but we can prevent the future
use of these barbaric weapons.

Resolution 2209 (2015) makes clear that use of
chlorine constitutes a breach of the Chemical Weapons
Convention. Its use by the regime constitutes yet one
more human rights violation. The regime's continued
use of barrel bombs, starvation and denial of medical
supplies amount to crimes against humanity. The
United Kingdom as long argued that the situation in
Syria should be referred to the International Criminal
Court but, in the face of vetoes by two other Council
members, that has not been possible. Today's important
resolution puts the Syrian regime on notice that if we
receive further credible reports of the use of chlorine
as a weapon then the Security Council will take action.
