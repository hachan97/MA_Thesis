The President (spoke in Chinese): I shall now make
a statement in my capacity as the representative of China.

Like all members of the Council, the Chinese
delegation wishes to thank Mr. Petritsch for his detailed
briefing. We have noted that, since the end of last year, the
situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina has steadily improved.
The municipal elections held in early April proceeded
smoothly, by and large. Overall economic reconstruction in
Bosnia and Herzegovina has also met with some measure
of success. All this is the result of the efforts made by the
people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and is also closely
linked to the support of the international community.

We have also taken note of the fact that the building
of national institutions has been progressing very slowly
and that national reconciliation has encountered many
obstacles and difficulties. The solution of these problems
requires long-term and tireless efforts from the parties in
Bosnia and Herzegovina and from the international
community. In this context, the international community
should focus its efforts more closely on realities in that
country in an attempt to assist its people to realize their
autonomy and independence.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

I call on Mr. Petritsch to respond to comments and
questions raised.
