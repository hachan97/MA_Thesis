Mr. Shen Guofang (China) (spoke in Chinese):
The Chinese delegation expresses its deep regret with
regard to the decision just made by the Security
Council. The Chinese delegation is of the view that the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is an important country
of the Balkan region. It is also a State that is directly
concerned and a party to the Dayton Agreement. It
does not matter whether or not we agree with the
policy of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia;
excluding the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from the
Security Council and not allowing it to speak will not
contribute to resolving the Balkan problem.

The Security Council should not deprive a
sovereign State of its right to state its position when it
wants to do so. This kind of action runs counter to the
spirit of the United Nations Charter. Therefore, we
would like again to express our deep regret with regard
to the decision just made by the Security Council.
