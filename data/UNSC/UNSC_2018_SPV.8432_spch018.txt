The President (spoke in French): I shall now make
a statement in my capacity as representative of Cote
d'Ivoire.

My delegation congratulates Mr. Jean-Pierre
Lacroix for his excellent briefing on the situation at the
border between Israel and Lebanon.

Cote d'Ivoire remains particularly concerned about
the recent discovery of tunnels along the Blue Line,
the demarcation line between Israel and Lebanon. The
discovery of four Hizbullah tunnels could exacerbate
tensions between the two countries and hinder the full
implementation of resolution 1701 (2006), of 11 August
2006. The relative calm in that area raised hopes for
improved relations between Israel and Lebanon.

My country condemns those Hizbullah actions,
which could endanger the lives and well-being of
millions of Lebanese citizens who aspire to live in
peace, following the trauma caused by the long civil
war in Lebanon and the 33-day war between Israel and
Lebanon in 2006.

My delegation therefore welcomes the investigation
conducted by the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) regarding the construction of
those tunnels and calls on all stakeholders to exercise
restraint pending the outcome of the investigation. In
that context, my delegation congratulates Maj or General
Del C01 and his troops for their professionalism in the
face of this difficult situation. C6te d'Ivoire encourages
the Lebanese authorities to provide all the necessary
assistance to UNIFIL, including access to private
property that might house those tunnels.

In conclusion, my country urges the parties
concerned to prioritize dialogue in order to resolve this
incident, as a new conflict between Israel and Hizbullah
would have dramatic consequences in a region that is,
unfortunately, beset by many crises.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Lebanon.
