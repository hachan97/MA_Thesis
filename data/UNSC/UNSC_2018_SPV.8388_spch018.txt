The President (spoke in Chinese): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of China.

First of all, I thank Ms. Fatou Bensouda for her
briefing today.

China is very concerned about the evolving situation
in Libya. We support all efforts that are conducive
to stabilizing the situation in Libya, promoting a
political settlement of the Libyan issue and combating
terrorism. We support the United Nations in continuing
to implement the related action plan by intensifying its
mediation efforts. China firmly supports the Libyan
people in safeguarding their national unity and State
integrity. We hope that all the parties in Libya will
adhere to a process for a political settlement that is
led and owned by the Libyans themselves, and work
to settle their differences through inclusive dialogue
and negotiations, building mutual trust, finding a
solution that accommodates the interests of all parties,
pushing for national reconciliation and restoring State
governance, with a view to achieving peace, stability
and development in Libya as soon as possible. The
international community should respect Libya's
independence, unity, sovereignty and territorial
integrity, and should continue its support and assistance
to Libya.

China's position on the International Criminal
Court remains unchanged.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Libya.
