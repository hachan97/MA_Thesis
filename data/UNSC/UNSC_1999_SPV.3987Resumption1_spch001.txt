The President (interpretation from Chinese): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Jamaica, in which she requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Miss Durrant
(Jamaica) took the seat reserved for her at the side of
the Council Chamber.

The President (interpretation from Chinese): The next
speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of the
Sudan. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and
to make his statement.
