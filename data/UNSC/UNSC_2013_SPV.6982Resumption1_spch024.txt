The President: I would like to again remind all
speakers to limit their statements to no more than
four minutes in order to enable the Council to carry
out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy
statements are kindly requested to circulate the text
in writing and to deliver a condensed version while
speaking in the Chamber.
I now give the floor to the representative of Gabon.
