The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to document S/1997/52, which contains the text
of a letter dated 20 January 1997 from the Charge
d'affaires ad interim of the Permanent Mission of the
Libyan Arab J amahiriya to the United Nations addressed to
the President of the Security Council, transmitting the text
of a letter dated 17 January 1997 from the Secretary of the
General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and
International Cooperation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya
addressed to the President of the Security Council.

Following consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council.

"The Security Council notes with concern the
letter of 17 January 1997 from the Secretary of the
General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and
International Cooperation of the Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya addressed to the President of the Security
Council, announcing that Libyan Arab Airways
would resume international flights out of Libya
immediately (5/1997/52). The Council considers the
position expressed in the letter of 17 January 1997
to be incompatible with Security Council resolution
748 (1992). Resolution 748 (1992) does not prohibit
overflights of Libyan territory. Paragraph 4 (a) of
the resolution does, however, prohibit all
international flights to and from Libya. The Security
Council would consider any such flights to be a
violation of the terms of resolution 748 (1992).

"The Security Council takes note of the reports
that a Libyan-registered aircraft, in apparent
violation of resolution 748 (1992), flew from Tripoli,
Libya to Accra, Ghana, on 21 January 1997, where
it landed and later departed. The Council has
requested the Committee established pursuant to
resolution 748 (1992) to follow up this matter. The
Council draws the attention of Member States to
their obligations under resolution 748 (1992) in the
event that Libyan-registered aircraft seek to land in
their territory."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/ 1997/2.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.

The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 3.40 pm.
