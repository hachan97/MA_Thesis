Today the Security Council renewed the authorization granted to States and regional organizations cooperating with the Somali authorities in the fight against piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia. Germany voted in favour of the resolution. With regard to operative paragraphs 11 and 29, we reiterate our understanding that the resolution includes cooperation not only with the Federal Government of Somalia but with all relevant Somali authorities, including the federal member states. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the European Union Capacity-Building Mission in Somalia have supported various capacity-building initiatives at the federal and state levels. Dialogue and cooperation among the Somali authorities at the federal and state levels are essential to build up effective maritime security capacities and working coast- guard structures capable of securing the sea off the coast of Somalia.
