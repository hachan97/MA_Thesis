The President: I shall now give the floor to those
members of the Security Council who wish to make
statements, and afterwards to representatives of other
Member States. I would like to remind colleagues that
there are more than 50 countries that wish to take the
floor. I would therefore ask speakers to respect the
time limits, insofar as possible. I will be using the
hourglass here.
