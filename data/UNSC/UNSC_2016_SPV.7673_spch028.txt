The President (spoke in Chinese): Today we
are holding a very solemn meeting of the Security
Council, and I therefore urge everyone to abide by all
the Council's provisional rules of procedure and keep
order in the Chamber so as to reflect the seriousness
of the question we are discussing. I expect all members
present to observe that.
