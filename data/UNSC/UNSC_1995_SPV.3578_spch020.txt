Sir John Weston (United Kingdom): The British
Government, too, welcomes the fact that the Co-Chairmen
of the Steering Committee of the International Conference
on the Former Yugoslavia (ICFY) have again been able
to report that the border between the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and the area of
Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of the Bosnian
Serbs remains closed. This has occurred despite the
practical difficulties which the ICFY Mission has faced
from time to time in carrying out its duties. We urge the
authorities of the FRY to maintain their cooperation with
the ICFY Mission and to ensure that the Mission can
operate in future in total freedom.

We welcome the increase in the period of suspension
of sanctions from 75 to 180 days. This extension reflects
the effective closure of the border. But it also reflects the
cooperative role being played by the authorities of the
FRY. We look forward to the day - not too far off, we
hope - when it will prove possible to lift all the
economic sanctions which have been imposed on the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro),
as part of the general settlement that is now being so
actively pursued.

The sanctions imposed by this Council have created
a climate in which the efforts of the international
community to bring about a peaceful resolution of the
conflicts in the former Yugoslavia are beginning to bear
fruit. The London Conference was a turning point. The
resolute North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and
United Nations response to the attack on the Sarajevo
market place and the diplomatic efforts of the United
States and of the Contact Group have offered a fresh
opportunity for the logic of peace to prevail. It is an
opportunity which must not be squandered, and Britain
stands ready to play its part.
