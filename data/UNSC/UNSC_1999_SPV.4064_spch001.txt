The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of
Tajikistan, in which he requests to be invited to participate
in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Alimov
(Tajikistan) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General on the situation in Tajikistan,
document S/l999/1127.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/ 1999/ 1158, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to document S/ 1999/ 1159, which contains the
text of a letter dated 11 November 1999 from Tajikistan,
transmitting the text of the Protocol on Political Guarantees
During the Preparation for and Holding of the Elections to
the Majlis-i Oli (the Parliament) of Tajikistan.

I give the floor to the representative of Tajikistan.
