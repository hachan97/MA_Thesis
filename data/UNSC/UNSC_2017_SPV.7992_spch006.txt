Mr. Seck (Senegal) (spoke in French): My
delegation voted in favour of resolution 2365 (2017),
as it believes in the importance of mine action in
maintaining international peace and security. I thank
the delegation of Bolivia for bringing this important
topic to the attention of the Security Council and for
demonstrating openness during the negotiations that
led to the adoption of resolution 2365 (2017).

Because it calls for cooperation among States,
the United Nations and other actors, including civil
society, and because it covers humanitarian and
sustainable development issues, resolution 2365 (2017)
provides opportunities for, in particular, countries
affected by the presence of land mines, the explosive
remnants of war and improvised explosive devices to
address such challenges for the benefit of the people
and communities concerned. As a major contributor
of troops to peacekeeping operations, Senegal also
welcomes the fact that the resolution reiterates the
threat posed by improvised explosive devices to
peacekeepers, who increasingly operate in volatile and
unpredictable environments.

As a State party to the Ottawa Convention, my
country has destroyed all of its anti-personnel mine
stockpiles, in compliance with its international
obligations, and will continue to raise awareness on
the issue by working side by side with its international
partners, in particular the 161 other States party to
the Convention, in an effort to ensure that that legally
binding international instrument becomes universal,
as it is vital to the protection and dignity of civilians.
In the light of the growing number of asymmetrical
threats, we call for a surge in political will 7 including
from countries that manufacture such weapons 7 with
a view to limiting or completely eliminating explosive

weapons, which pose a genuine threat to international
peace and security. We hope that the adoption of
resolution 2365 (2017) is just the first step on the path to
even more voluntary and robust mine action measures.

The meeting ruse at 10.25 am.
