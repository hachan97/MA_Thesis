The President (spoke in French): I thank Judge
Jorda for giving us specific, well-reasoned and
enthusiastic answers to the various questions that have
been asked of him. We have taken good note of his
suggestion concerning the pace of work of the working
group that will now certainly be established by the
Security Council. We have also taken due note of his
suggestion that the informal working group keep in
contact with his Tribunal. As Judge Jorda suggested, I
am sure that we will have the honour and pleasure of
welcoming him back here once again. I certainly hope
so.

There are no speakers remaining on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council will. of course. remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rm m 1.30 pm.
