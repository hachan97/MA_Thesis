The President (spoke in Russian): I thank
Ambassador De La Sabliere for his statement.

On behalf of the Council, I should like to express
gratitude and appreciation to all the members of the
Security Council mission, which was very ably led by
Ambassador De La Sabliere, for the manner in which
they discharged their important responsibility on the
Council's behalf.

The next speaker is the representative of Rwanda.
I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to
make his statement.
