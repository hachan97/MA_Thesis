Mr. Nufiez Mosquera (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):
I will be brief. What the representative of the United
States has just said is exactly what the Cuban
delegation is saying. Mr. Luis Posada Carriles, a well-
known and self-confessed international terrorist,
continues to be prosecuted for lesser crimes relating to
immigration in this country. I wonder when Posada
Carriles will be tried for the crimes of terrorism to
which he himself has confessed.

I reiterate that the Counter-Terrorism Committee
has all the information it needs and that the delegation
of Cuba is prepared to come and make yet another
presentation before it on this matter.
