The President (spoke in Spanish): Before resuming
my duties as President of the Council, I should like to
make a brief statement in my national capacity.

When I spoke earlier about the achievements of
the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), I
forgot to mention the Santa Marta agreement, which
was reached between President Santos Calderon and
President Hugo Chavez Frias. Colombia and Venezuela
were on the verge of an armed conflict, and it was the
then Secretary-General of UNASUR, President Nestor
Kirchner, who acted as mediator in achieving that
agreement. That achievement was a very important one
for me, and has both institutional and personal value.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Chile.
