Mr. Omaish (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): At the
outset, allow me to express my thanks and appreciation
to you and your team, Sir, for your excellent stewardship
of the work of the Council this month. There have
been many developments in the international arena
on issues related to the work of the Council. Our work
culminated at the end of last week in the adoption of the
two important resolutions 2213 (2015) and 2214 (2015)
on the situation in Libya. In that regard, I commend
your very effective and productive management of the
affairs of the Council this month.

I also welcome the French initiative in organizing
the open debate on the protection of minorities in
the Middle East (see S/PV.7419). The meeting was an
important opportunity to highlight the magnitude of
the internal difficulties in the Middle East as a result of
terrorism, which deliberately and systematically targets
religious and ethnic minorities in Syria and Iraq with
the aim of eliminating them. At the same time, I would
like to stress that security, peace and stability will
come to the Middle East only when efforts to confront
terrorism and extremism are coupled with a serious
and comprehensive attempt to address the root causes
that underlie such acts. The main challenges facing the
Middle East, in particular the Israeli-Arab conflict and
the crisis in Syria, are at the heart of instability in the
region and must be taken into account.

To conclude, Jordan looks forward to cooperating
with Member States next month and hopes that our
delegation will do as well as the March presidency.
