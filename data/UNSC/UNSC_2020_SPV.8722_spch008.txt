Mr. Auveart (Estonia): Estonia supported the adoption of resolution 2510 (2020) to endorse the Berlin Conference conclusions. The positivemomentum achieved in Berlin needed to be enhanced and solidified, and that is what the resolution does. We thank the United Kingdom and Germany for their work and patience in leading the negotiations over the past three and a half weeks - a process that should have taken far less time considering the actual urgency of the situation on the ground in Libya. The core message of the resolution is clear. First, the foreign interference in the conflict and the blatant violations of the arms embargo must stop, as agreed on in Berlin. Secondly, the parties to the conflict need to agree on an immediate and lasting ceasefire, which is the basis for any further steps towards sustainable peace in Libya. Last, but by no means least, international efforts on Libya need to be led by the United Nations. Estonia fully supports Special Representative Salame's three-point plan and his mediation between the Libyan parties. We need a united Security Council to send a clear signal to the parties involved in the Libyan conflict, as well as to the Libyan people in their daily suffering, by implementing what was agreed in Berlin and here today. Let us not fail them and continue with the implementation of the Berlin conclusions.
