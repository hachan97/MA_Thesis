Mr. Oyarzun Marchesi (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): Gabriel Garcia Marquez should have lived
two years longer. If he had, he would have been here
to witness this truly historic moment for Colombia and
Colombians. Today Gabo would be an extraordinarily
happy man, because he personally stood for peace
for us all. As he said, in the midst of confusion and
disenchantment, we continued to believe, in an obstinate
and perhaps illusory way, that peace was possible.
Today Colombians have shown that to be true and have
put five decades of conflict behind them. The time has
come to congratulate the Government of Colombia and
all Colombians.

Today we, the members of the Security Council,
have the honour, along with the entire international
community, to be able to bear witness to the
reconciliation of all Colombians, represented here by
my dear friend Foreign Minister Maria Angela Holguin
Cuellar. It is also a historic day for the Council, because
we have adopted resolution 2261 (2016) with 15 votes
in favour and 15 sponsors, something that has happened
only three times in the past three years. The resolution
assigns to the United Nations a major role in helping
to write what is probably one of the most promising
pages of recent history. As always, Spain is here for
Colombia. We offer it our experience in the area of
peace processes, as Members of the United Nations
and as members of the European Union, from which
we will channel assistance to Colombia and its people.
Colombia should know that Spain will always be by its
side.
