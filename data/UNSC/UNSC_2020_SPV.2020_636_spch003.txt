I thank Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo for her briefing. I welcome the participation of the Foreign Minister of Egypt and the Ambassadors of Ethiopia and the Sudan. China places great importance on the issue of Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, and takes note of the positions expressed in the letters from the Foreign Ministers of Egypt, Ethiopia and the Sudan. China fully understands the concerns of the three countries on this matter, welcomes that the Bureau of the African Union Assembly of Heads of State and Government held a video-teleconference on an extraordinary basis on 26 June and commends that relevant countries have committed to resolving differences through negotiations. The utilization of cross-border water resources must take into account the combined interests of upstream and downstream countries, and is therefore highly complicated and sensitive. China holds the view that this issue should be resolved for mutual benefit by the three parties through dialogue and consultation. The African continent has a good tradition of solving regional issues through dialogue and consultation. Egypt, Ethiopia and the Sudan are all important countries in the region and good friends of China. China sincerely hopes that the three parties will reach a solution acceptable to all through patient dialogue and consultation. We hope that the international community will create a conducive external environment and support the three parties in narrowing differences through dialogue and consultation in an effort to maintain peace, stability and development in Africa. The Council's consideration of the Renaissance Dam issue should not set a precedent. China is ready to work with all parties to play a constructive role.
