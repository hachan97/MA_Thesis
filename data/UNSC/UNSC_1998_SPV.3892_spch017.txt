The President: I thank the representative of Albania
for his kind words addressed to me.

With the concurrence of members of the Council I
intend to suspend the meeting now.

The meeting was suspended at 1.05 p.m and resumed
at 3.35 p.m.

The President: It is my understanding that the
Council is ready to vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution
to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the voting.
