Mr. Sevilla Borja (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish):
We take the floor at today's important open debate of
the Security Council to reiterate Ecuador's historic
commitment to the cause of peace in the Middle East
and its support for the efforts of the international
community to resolve outstanding conflicts in the
region through peaceful methods delineated under
international law for the settlement of disputes.
The fact that in the second decade of the twenty-
first century, the independent State of Palestine has not
yet been established or joined the United Nations as a
full-fledged State Member, as set forth in the partition
plan contained in General Assembly resolution 181 (II)
of 29 November 1947, makes resolving this issue the
fundamental and priority duty of the Organization.
We are therefore concerned about the lack of effective
action by the Security Council, the indifference of the
Powers directly involved and the obstinacy of extremist
sectors in the State of Israel that have been encouraged
by external supporters.

At the same time, we are encouraged that, in its
latest report, the Quartet has reiterated that

"a negotiated two-State outcome is the only way to
achieve an enduring peace that meets Israeli security
needs and Palestinian aspirations for Statehood and
sovereignty, [and] ends the occupation that began
in 1967".

The report also offers a glimmer ofhope that in the form
of the laudable efforts of France, with its initiative to
convene an international conference on the Middle East.

Finally, we reiterate the continued support of
the Government and the people of Ecuador for the
legitimate right of the Palestinian people to establish an
independent State with the 1967 borders and with East
Jerusalem as its capital. If the international community
had resolved this issue with due timeliness, it would
have spared us a great deal in terms of terrible human
suffering and we would have avoided the rise of the
reprehensible terrorist acts that are disrupting world
peace today. We are facing a highly political issue that
requires political solutions, even though it has involved
gross violations of international law and serious
attacks on human rights and has had reprehensible
humanitarian consequences.
