The President: I thank the representative of Cuba
for the kind words he addressed to me.

I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the
representative of the United States.

The United States reserves its right to respond to the
unfounded comments in the statement of the Cuban
representative.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

There are no further speakers. The views of the
members of the Council will be expressed in a
presidential statement at the next meeting of the Council.

The next meeting of the Security Council, to
continue consideration of the item on the agenda, will
take place immediately following the adjournment of this
meeting.

The meeting rose at 3.45 am.
