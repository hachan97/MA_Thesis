Mr. Kawamura (Japan): Japan welcomes the
unanimous adoption of resolution 2379 (2017) and is
pleased to have co-sponsored it. I would like to express
my gratitude to the United Kingdom for having taken
the lead on drafting this important resolution.

We support the resolution's setting up of an
investigative team to assist Iraq in collecting evidence
of the crimes committed by the Islamic State in Iraq
and the Levant (ISIL), including those that may amount
to war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.
Collecting and preserving evidence is essential in order
to bring the perpetrators of those crimes to justice
in future.

We strongly hope that through its impartial and
independent investigation, the team will help Iraq in
preventing violent extremism and in promoting national
reconciliation among the people.

Japan will continue to stand with the people of Iraq
in fighting violent extremism.
