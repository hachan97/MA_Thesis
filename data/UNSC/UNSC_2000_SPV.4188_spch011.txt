Mr. Martinsen (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): I
should like to begin by echoing the thanks conveyed by
earlier speakers to the Under-Secretary-General for
Peacekeeping Operations, Mr. Bernard Miyet, for the
briefing he just gave us on the situation in Bosnia and
Herzegovina and on the activities of the United Nations
Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH).

At present, certain events and facts permit some
optimism about the consolidation of political
institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina with a View to
building a modern democratic State, five years after the
conclusion of the Dayton Accords. Those events
include the opening of some State Border Service
posts, as mentioned by Mr. Miyet, at Sarajevo, Izacic
and other locations. We think this is a particularly
significant step in the fight against smuggling and
illegal migration.

Another positive fact is that the Council of
Ministers has approved the amendment of passport
legislation to make possible a single Bosnia and
Herzegovina passport. That helps meet one of the
commitments made to the Security Council last year by
the three members ofthe Joint Presidency.

My delegation is particularly pleased at Mr.
Miyet's comments on the increased rate of return of
refugees and internally displaced persons to their
homes, in particular in areas where there had been the
greatest difficulties in this regard.

A matter for regret was that the High
Representative felt obliged to remove the Minister of
Agriculture, Water Resources and Forestry of the
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Director
of the Federation Tax Administration from their posts
in view of their obstructive behaviour, which was
hampering the implementation of the Dayton Peace
Agreement. The Council and the international
community as a whole should lend full support to the
High Representative as he works to build and
consolidate joint democratic participatory institutions
in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
