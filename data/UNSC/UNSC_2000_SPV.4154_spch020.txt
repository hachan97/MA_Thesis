The President (spoke in French): I thank Mr.
Jacques Klein for his comments, which, as always,
have been precise and energetic. I thank him for having
mentioned the contributions of different States as an
example of what the international community can
accomplish when it joins forces in a country which
needs to continue to receive our support.

There are no other speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
ofits consideration ofthe item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 1.45 pm.
