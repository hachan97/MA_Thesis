Mr. Doraiswami (India): We have listened
carefully to the statement made by the Ambassador of
Pakistan. The issue at hand is that of terrorism, and the
use of territory controlled by Pakistan, by terrorist
groups based in Pakistan, to perpetrate acts of terror in
India. Pakistan should focus its attention on taking
action against the criminals who perpetrate, aid, abet,
finance or otherwise support terrorism, rather than
bringing before this Council extraneous issues relating
to the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir.
