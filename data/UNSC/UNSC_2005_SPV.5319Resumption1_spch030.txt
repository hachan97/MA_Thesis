The President: I thank all those who contributed
to this debate, as well as those who observed it and
listened to it.

The discussion on the draft resolution on this
subject will now continue. My hope is that that
discussion will draw upon the richness of the debate
we have had today and that, over the course of next
week, we can move to finalize and adopt a text. That is
what the President of the Council will try to deliver.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 5.05 p.m.
