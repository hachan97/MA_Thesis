Mr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): Mr. President,
even as we meet right now, a humanitarian tragedy of
immense magnitude is unfolding in the West Bank. The
continued perpetration of Israeli atrocities is
compounding the pains of Palestine. These are now
beyond bearable proportions.

United States Secretary of State Colin Powell has
completed a crucial mission to the region. He has
undertaken a massive effort to de-escalate a dangerous
situation. We are, therefore, deeply indebted to him. No
endeavour, such as his, made in genuine earnestness, is
ever in vain. It has already sharpened international
focus on the need to remain engaged in the pursuit of
peace.

We now see it as the Council's responsibility to
complement these initiatives as well as to support the
Secretary-General's proposal. The latter has called for
the deployment of a multinational force. It seems to us
that we no longer have the luxury of choice or options.
It is imperative that the Council endorse the idea and
authorize the force.

The robustness of the mandate must match the
challenges on the ground. Time is of the essence. Any
delay could lead to horrific consequences.

It is not just a moral imperative on the part of the
Council to ensure that its resolutions are complied
with. It is also a practical one. The Council has not
only to be credible, it must also be seen to be credible.
Should there be discrepancy between its word and
deed, its capacity to discharge its responsibilities under
the Charter could begin to erode. This cannot be to
anyone's benefit, now or in the future. The perception
of the Council as the guardian of peace is a sine qua
non for the United Nations to be viewed as a guarantor
of a better world.
