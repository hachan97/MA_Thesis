Mr. Tafrov (Bulgaria) (spoke in French): I should
like to extend my delegation's congratulations to you,
Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the
Security Council and to assure you of our full
cooperation.

I should also like to thank Ambassador Jones
Parry for his skilful presidency last month.

Bulgaria categorically condemns the terrorist act
carried out yesterday in Haifa, as we always do on such
occasions. It is important for all those who make such
acts possible to do their utmost to end them by ceasing
all material and moral support to them. The murder of
an innocent child is particularly repugnant.

Bulgaria believes that Israel's armed action
against the Syrian Arab Republic is not in accordance
with the Charter of the United Nations or with
international law. Like other delegations, we consider it
to have been an unacceptable act. The only resolution
of the Middle East crisis - which has of late grown
more serious - lies in the implementation of the road
map devised by the Quartet, as the Quartet itself noted
in its statement following its most recent meeting in
New York.
