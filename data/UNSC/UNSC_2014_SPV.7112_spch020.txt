The President: Once again, I would like to thank
Baroness Catherine Ashton for her presence here today.
As this is likely to be her last time briefing the Council,
let me thank her for her personal contribution to the
building of peace and security throughout the world,
and in particular for her efforts in cooperation with the
United Nations.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 1.20 pm.
