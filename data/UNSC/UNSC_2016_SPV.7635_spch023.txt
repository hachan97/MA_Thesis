Mr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): I will not make a long
statement again, because I said what I said.

It is probably very easy for my Russian colleague
to pick a few parts of my statement and react to them.
Consequently, my question is: Why does he not react to
everything I said? Why does he not react to the figures,
to my call for the release of the political prisoners who
are being held in Russia? It is a fact, which has been
proven by many, that Russia has fulfilled none of its
obligations under the Minsk agreements. Let us talk
about everything in the Minsk agreements, not only
about the constitutional amendments and the elections.
They are not the topic ofthis meeting, after all, so I will
not go into detail.

Finally, during two years of aggression, a
40,000-strong army has been built up in the Donbas.
That army is financed, equipped and maintained by
Russia and commanded by Russian officers. It has been
supplied with sophisticated modern Russian weaponry.
I have a very long list of weapons that are not and
were never produced in Ukraine. Those weapons did
not just fall from the sky. And the list goes on and on.
Therefore, let us be more precise when we react to facts
or allegations.
