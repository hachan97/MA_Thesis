Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I want to take the
floor again to make the following point. It is good that
under rule 37 we can hear from Members of the United
Nations that are not currently serving on the Security
Council. But I really do think that delegations that
speak under rule 37 should speak to the agenda item
at hand. The agenda item today has been Syria. The
situation in Syria is dire enough. I do not think it right
that some representatives on this side who spoke under
rule 37 used it to pursue personal and national agendas
against other Members of the United Nations.

The situation is bad enough in Syria that it deserves
our whole attention. We ought to be working as a
Council, supported by the wider membership, to support
the Secretary-General and his Special Envoy. We do
not need lectures from two countries that have done
more than anyone else to contribute to the dire situation
inside Syria. I therefore hope that when Member States
ask to speak under rule 37 in future - and we want to
invite them to do so for all the reasons of transparency
and openness that we all subscribe to - they will stick
to the agenda at hand.
Mr. Cohen (United States of America); I would
like to fully associate myself with the statement that
the representative of the United Kingdom just made
and to add that, in particular, coming from a regime
whose behaviour and use of chemical weapons has
driven millions of its own citizens to flee as refugees,
that statement was outrageous, whether made here in
the Council or indeed anywhere.
