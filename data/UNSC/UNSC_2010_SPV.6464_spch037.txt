Mr. De Mistura: I think the only thing I can say
at this stage is that on behalf of all my colleagues in
Afghanistan - both in Kabul and in all our different
locations - I would like to express deep appreciation
for the strong and clear support I have been hearing for
the work of UNAMA and for the joint venture that
UNAMA and the Afghan authorities are trying to carry
out in order to improve the situation in the country.

The year 2011 will be very challenging. Seeing
the Security Council united, as I saw it today, in
supporting the work of the United Nations and the
work of the Afghan authorities to stabilize the country
will give us a lot of strength to get through next year.
