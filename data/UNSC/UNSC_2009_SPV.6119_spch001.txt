The President (spoke in Russian): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Nepal in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Acharya
(Nepal) took a seat at the Council table.

The President (spoke in Russian): I propose,
with the consent of the Council, to extend an invitation
under rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure to
Ms. Karin Landgren, Representative of the Secretary-
General in Nepal.

It is so decided.

I invite Ms. Landgren to take a seat at the
Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the request of Nepal
for United Nations assistance in support of its peace
process (S/2009/221).

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Ms. Karin Landgren.

I now give her the floor.
