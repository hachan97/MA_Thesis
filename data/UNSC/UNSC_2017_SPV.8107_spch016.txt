The President: I will now make a statement in my
capacity as the representative of Italy.

Italy supported the draft resolution put forward by

Japan (S/2017/970) and would like to thank the Japanese
delegation for its effort. We have already affirmed
many times, including in this Chamber yesterday, the
importance we attach to the global non-proliferation
architecture and to ensuring accountability for
violations ofits norms. In our view, the Organization for
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations
Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) is a crucial tool in
that regard, and we are not ready to simply accept that
its existence is over. We are once again disappointed in
the result ofthe vote. We have until midnight. Ifthere is
even the slightest chance ofrenewing the JIM's mandate
by then, we will work constructively to draft that last
chance. Otherwise, we will continue striving to find
agreement on an issue of crucial importance to us all
and to the Council's ability to fulfil its responsibilities.
Italy also supports Sweden's proposal in that regard.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

There are no more speakers inscribed on the list
of speakers. I now invite Council members to informal
consultations, as requested by Sweden, to continue our
discussion on the subject.

The meeting rose at 7.05 pm.
