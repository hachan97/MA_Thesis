Ms. Guadey (Ethiopia): We thank the delegation
of the United Kingdom for its briefing and updates
on the outcome of its investigation of the Salisbury
incident. We also take note of the statement delivered
by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to the
Parliament, which was circulated among members
of the Security Council yesterday. Furthermore, we
have seen the summary of the report on activities
carried out by the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons in support ofa request for technical
assistance by the United Kingdom, which was released
two days ago.

Our position on the use of chemical weapons
is well known, and we strongly condemn any use of
chemical weapons by any State or non-State actor. It is
unacceptable and constitutes a serious violation under
international law. Nevertheless, we understand that a
number of issues still require further clarification,
and unfortunately we do not have all the necessary
information before us.

One thing is very clear, however. Cooperation
between the United Kingdom and the Russian
Federation is absolutely vital in getting to the bottom of
this issue. That should be done in good faith and a fair
manner by undertaking the necessary consultation and
exchange of information. That is what will help address
the issue once and for all in a way that would allay the
concerns of the United Kingdom and ultimately bring
those responsible to justice.
