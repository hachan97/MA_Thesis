The President: There are no more names inscribed on the list of speakers. I will now adjourn the meeting so that the Council can continue its discussion on the subject in closed consultations. I would kindly ask all observers to promptly exit the Chamber directly upon the adjournment of the meeting. The meeting rose at 11.55 a.m.
