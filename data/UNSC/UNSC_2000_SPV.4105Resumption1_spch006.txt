Mr. Kasse (Mali) (spoke in French): I too should like
to thank the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the
Balkans, Mr. Carl Bildt, for his very instructive briefing.
The situation in the Balkans is complex, and stability is far
from being a reality in that region, as the recent events in
Mitrovica have made clear.

Nevertheless, we believe that there are grounds for
optimism, because the time is ripe for discussion aimed at
finding a definitive and comprehensive solution to the long-
lasting conflict in the Balkans. We support the efforts made
by Mr. Bildt, and we are firmly convinced that national
reconciliation, reconstruction, solidarity, security and a
regional approach, inter alia, remain the pillars of any
comprehensive solution to the conflicts in the Balkans.

The Security Council must render its full support to
the search for a regional solution that would safeguard all
of the negotiations under way. We wish Mr. Bildt every
success in his mission.
