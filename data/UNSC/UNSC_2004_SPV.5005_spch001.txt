The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Japan,
Liberia, the Netherlands, Nigeria and Sierra Leone in
which they request to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the discussion, without the right to
vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Djangone-Bi
(Cote d'Ivoire), Nana Efiah-Apenteng (Ghana),
Mr. Sow (Guinea), Mr. Haragachi (Japan),
Mr. Kawah (Liberia), Mr. Van den Berg
(Netherlands), Mr. Adekanye (Nigeria) and
Mr. Pemagbi (Sierra Leone) took the seats
reserved for them at the side of the Council
Chamber

The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Dumisani
Kumalo, Chairman of the Economic and Social Council
Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Guinea-Bissau.

It is so decided.

I invite the Chairman of the Economic and Social
Council Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Guinea-Bissau to
take the seat reserved for him at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2004/525, which contains the report of the
Security Council mission to West Africa, 20-29 June
2004.

I should now like to give the floor to the
representative of the United Kingdom, Sir Emyr Jones
Parry, in his capacity as head of the Security Council
mission to West Africa.
