Mr. Mangaral (Chad) (spoke in French): I thank
Mr. Feltman for his briefing. I welcome the transition
Prime Minister of Ukraine, Mr. Yatsenyuk, and thank
him for the information he has provided.

Chad notes with great concern the continuing
escalation of the crisis in Ukraine, despite the repeated
calls of the international community, in particular the
Security Council, for calm and restraint. We think
that it is still possible to take the path of national
reconciliation and preservation of the unity of Ukraine
through an inclusive process of dialogue between the
different components and respecting diversity.

Chad also calls for the respect for territorial
integrity, the non-use of force and the peaceful
settlement of disputes in conformity with the Charter
of the United Nations. The parties must take the
necessary steps to create a climate of dialogue with a
View to achieving genuine national reconciliation and
respecting human rights, more specifically, the rights
of minorities. Chad supports international mediation
for a peaceful outcome of the crisis and welcomes the
efforts deployed by the Secretary-General towards that
end.
