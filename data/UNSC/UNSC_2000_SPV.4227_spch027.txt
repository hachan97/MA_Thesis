The President: I would like to thank all the
members of the Security Council for their
contributions. As a result of this debate, I would like to
underscore the following points.

The conflict between the parties needs to be
resolved through a comprehensive peace agreement.
The United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea
(UNMEE) can fulfil a useful role in creating the
conditions necessary to reach an arrangement, but its
presence is not an alternative to such a peace
arrangement. Several delegations expressed support for
our suggestion that confidence-building measures
should be adopted by both parties. I repeat my
suggestion that a group of friends be established in
support of the peace process. The full deployment of
UNMEE must take place as soon as possible. I can
inform the Council that the Netherlands will start its
strategic lift next week and that our deployment should
be complete by mid-December.

The Security Council fully supports the work of
the Organization of African Unity, in particular
Algeria's efforts and those of concerned member States
in order to reach a comprehensive peace arrangement.
Finally, the Council stands ready to support an eventual
peace arrangement.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 1.45 pm.
