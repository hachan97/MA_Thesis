The President: Since this is our last scheduled
meeting for the month, I would like to express the
sincere appreciation of the delegation of Azerbaijan to
the members of the Council, especially my colleagues
the Permanent Representatives, their respective staffs
and the secretariat of the Council for all the support
they have given to us.

As we have said, it has been a busy month. We
could not have done it alone or without the hard work,
support and positive contributions of every delegation
and the representatives of the Secretariat, as well as the
other professionals who ably provide all of the various
meetings services required by the Council throughout
the month. As we end our presidency, I know I speak
on behalf of the Council in wishing the delegation of
China good luck in the month of November.
There are no more names inscribed on the list of
speakers. I now invite Council members to informal
consultations to continue our discussion of the subject.

The meeting rose at10.45 am.
