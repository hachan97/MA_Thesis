The President: I think everybody will agree with
the remarks of the representative of Argentina about
the need for the decisions adopted by the Security
Council always to be accompanied by a willingness to
act decisively to implement them. Indeed, it is exactly
this point that was also highlighted in the introductory
statement made by the Secretary-General.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Algeria. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
