Mr. Butagira (Uganda): Uganda voted in favour
of the resolution because of the urgency of the need to
put an end to the hostilities and to the humanitarian
tragedy. We believe that the resolution is balanced and
provides for an immediate, durable and fully respected
ceasefire, the protection of civilians and humanitarian
access.

During the past few days, Uganda has called for
the Council to maintain its unity, and today's outcome
reflects a consensus resolution, which is an indication
that the Council is aware of its important responsibility
for the maintenance of international peace and security.
Recent developments are a reminder that the Council
should remain fully engaged in seeking a
comprehensive peace in the Middle East through the
two-State solution, with Palestine and Israel living in
peace with one another. Finally, we urge the parties
involved to move very quickly to implement the
provisions of this resolution.
