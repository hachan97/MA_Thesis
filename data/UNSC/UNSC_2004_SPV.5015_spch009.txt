Mr. De Palacio Espafia (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): The gravity of the situation we are facing in
Darfur calls for a clear and urgent response by the
Security Council. We believe that the text just adopted,
which Spain sponsored, fulfils those requirements. In a
balanced manner, the resolution reminds the Sudanese
Government of the responsibilities derived from the
commitments it has assumed, which are set out in the
joint communique signed on 3 July. The Security
Council must ensure that the Sudanese Government
fulfils its commitments. We hope that this will be the
case; if not, the Council must be prepared to adopt all
measures necessary to guarantee the fulfilment of those
commitments.

This firm message should be understood as being
aimed also at the Janjaweed militias and those
supporting them as well as at the rebels, and we urge
them to fulfil the obligations imposed on them by the
resolution. But the resolution also highlights the
leadership role played by the African Union in the
resolution of this crisis, stressing the importance of a
regional approach in addressing the crisis. This can
only work to the benefit of the Sudanese political
process as a whole. We must continue supporting the
efforts of the African Union and encouraging member
States to do their part. This is a very valuable
opportunity to strengthen their structures of
cooperation for the maintenance of peace and security
on the continent.

Finally, I must not fail to mention our deep
concern at the ongoing violations of human rights and
international humanitarian law that are taking place in
Darfur. European Union Foreign Ministers stated in
Brussels on 26 July, and as reflected in this resolution,
those acts must not remain unpunished. The Security
Council must ensure that those responsible are
apprehended and brought to justice. My delegation will
strive to ensure that that happens.
