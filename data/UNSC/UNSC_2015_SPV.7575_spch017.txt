Mr. Sarki (Nigeria): I also thank Under-Secretary-
General Jeffrey Feltman and United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein
for their presence.

Nigeria attaches great importance to respect for
human rights and fundamental freedoms everywhere.
We consider it an obligation for States to promote and
protect the rights of their citizens. Human rights are
essential in ensuring that all human beings live in
dignity.

We agree with the Under-Secretary-General that
there are different perspectives on the issue of human
rights and international peace and security. We believe
that independent and sovereign States must be engaged
with on all matters, including human rights, on the
basis of mutual respect and constructive dialogue. The
issue of human rights must also not be linked to the
issue of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and
the testing of missiles.

In the framework of one of its three main pillars,
the United Nations has established appropriate
mechanisms for promoting and protecting human
rights throughout the world. Those mechanisms,
which include the Human Rights Council, special
procedures, the Universal Periodic Review and treaty
bodies, have been shown to be relevant in dealing with
human rights issues, as they concern all United Nations
States Members. We note that the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea participated in the first and second
cycles of the Universal Periodic Review. We also
note that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
has ratified several key international human rights
treaties. Nigeria will therefore continue to encourage
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to maintain,
and indeed strengthen, its engagement with the Human
Rights Council and the treaty bodies, with a view to
promoting and protecting the rights of its citizens.
