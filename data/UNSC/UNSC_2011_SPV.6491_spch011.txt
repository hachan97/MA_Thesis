Mr. Moraes Cabral (Portugal): Portugal
welcomes the adoption of resolution 1970 (2011). It
particularly welcomes the fact that it was adopted
unanimously. The Council thus was united in sending a
11-24528
clear, swift and strong message to the perpetrators of
heinous crimes taking place in Libya.

Portugal calls for an immediate cessation of
violence in Libya. The killing of civilians and
intolerable abuses of human rights must cease
forthwith. We are deeply concerned with the plight of
the increasing number of refugees, and we consider
that humanitarian assistance must be allowed without
hindrance.

The basic freedoms of the Libyan people must be
respected and guaranteed. The safety of foreign
nationals must be assured as well as the safe exit of
those who wish to leave the country. Finally, impunity
will not be tolerated, and the perpetrators of these
crimes against civilians will be prosecuted.
