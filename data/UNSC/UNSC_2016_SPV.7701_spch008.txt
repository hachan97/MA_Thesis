Mr. Ramirez Carreflo (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): I should simply like to
raise a question with regard to procedure here in the
Council, because it is my understanding that this was to
be a briefing followed by private consultations. Are we
going to be discussing Mr. O'Brien's briefing in public
meeting or is it going to be in consultations? If it is
public, then we should begin the discussion here, but
I believe that otherwise we should be conducting this
discussion in closed consultations.
