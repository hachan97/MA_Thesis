The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Kenya and Rwanda, in which they
request to be invited to participate in the discussion of
the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with
the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the
Council, to invite those representatives to participate in
the discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Kahende
(Kenya) and Mr. Mutoboba (Rwanda) took the seats
reserved for them at the side of the Council Chamber.

I should like to inform the Council that I have
received a letter dated 20 July 2000 from the
Permanent Representative of Malaysia to the United
Nations that reads as follows:

"I have the honour, in my capacity as
Chairman of the Islamic Group of the United
Nations, to request that the Security Council
extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to His Excellency
Mr. Mokhtar Lamani, Permanent Observer of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference to the
United Nations, during the Council's discussion
on the role of the Security Council in the
prevention of armed conflicts."

This letter will be issued as a document of the Security
Council under the symbol S/2000/7l7.

If I hear no objection, I shall take it that the
Council agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 to
Mr. Mokhtar Lamani.

It is so decided.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Colombia. I invite him to take a seat
at the Council table and to make his statement.
