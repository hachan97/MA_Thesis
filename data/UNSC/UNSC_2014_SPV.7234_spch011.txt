Mr. Oh Joon (Republic of Korea): I would like to
thank Mr. John Ging for his briefing today.

The Republic of Korea remains deeply concerned
about the continuing escalation of tensions in eastern
Ukraine. Despite the ongoing diplomatic efforts of the
international community, the situation on the ground
shows no sign of abating. The continung violence has
led to a growing loss of life and a further deterioration in
the humanitarian situation. We are especially concerned
about the report that the number of internally displaced
persons (IDPs) in Ukraine has reached 117,000, having
risen sharply since June. At the same time, the lack of
adequate shelter and basic services, such as water and
electricity for the IDPs, also remains a major source
of concern. Given the gravity of the situation, further
and broader humanitarian measures, such as more
humanitarian corridors, are urgently needed.

The volatile situation in eastern Ukraine clearly
demonstrates that a solution to the ongoing crisis
can be found only through an immediate cessation of
hostilities and through meaningful dialogue among
all the parties concerned. In that regard, we welcome
the recent meeting of the trilateral contact group held
in Minsk on 31 July with representatives of separatist
groups from eastern Ukraine. We call on all parties to
engage in constructive dialogue so that they can agree
on an immediate ceasefire on the basis of the Berlin
declaration of 2 July. In that connection, all illegal
armed groups must halt all violence and lay down their
arms. That is the key for any sustainable solution to the
cr1s1s.

Finally, turning to the downing of Malaysia
Airlines Flight MH-17, we reiterate our support
for a full, thorough and independent international
investigation. All the parties concerned must comply
with their obligations under resolution 2166 (2014) and
fully cooperate with the international investigation.
