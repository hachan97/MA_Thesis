Mr. Skoog (Sweden): We regret that the Security
Council was unable to adopt draft resolution S/2017/1060
before us. Here in the Council, we recently outlined in
detail the reasons that we disagree with the recognition
by the United States of Jerusalem as the capital ofIsrael
and with the plan to move the United States Embassy to
that city. We voted in favour of the draft resolution for
a number of reasons.

First, it stresses that Jerusalem is a final-status
issue and can therefore be resolved only through
negotiations, in line with the relevant United Nations
resolutions. Furthermore, it reaffirms that the holy city
of Jerusalem, as a city holy to three religions, has a
specific status. Most important, it reaffirms the view of
the Council, expressed in previous resolutions, that any
decision and actions that purport to alter the character
and status of Jerusalem have no legal effect and must
be rescinded.

We also agree with the call on all States to refrain
from the establishment of diplomatic missions in
Jerusalem, in line with resolution 478 (1980). The
European Union (EU) has a firm position on Jerusalem,
which explains why all EU member States represented
on the Council voted in favour of the draft resolution
today. I would also like to state clearly that today's vote
does not impact the resolutions adopted by the Council.
The status of Jerusalem remains unchanged under
international law.

Finally, looking forward, we urgently need to
relaunch the peace process. It is high time to show
commitment and to move ahead with a detailed
peace plan that addresses all final-status issues in a
manner consistent with the known parameters. The
Security Council has the responsibility to do that. All
stakeholders, including regional actors, should now
engage more than ever for peace in the Middle East.
