Mr. Adi (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): I
apologize for taking the floor a second time. Once again,
let me say that my delegation has repeatedly warned of
the danger of being diverted from the substance of the
item under consideration, the fundamental objective of
which is the self-determination of Palestine and not the
situation in neighbouring countries. I shall not fall into
that trap.

However, let me point out the lies and half-truths that
the representative ofIsrael has cited. The representative
of Israel is speaking in the Security Council, which
has adopted hundreds of resolutions calling for an end
to Israeli occupation of Arab land. Is he trying to tell
us about the steps Israel has taken to implement those
resolutions, to end the plight of Arab peoples under
Israeli occupation, and to end settlements?

Some delegations have indeed fallen into that trap
and have spoken of the plight of the Syrian people,
while forgetting the plight of Syrians under occupation
in the Syrian Arab Golan. The Government of the
Syrian Arab Republic believes in the pivotal role of
the United Nations. It believes in the role being played
by the Council in maintaining international peace and
security. Therefore we continue to call on the Council
to enforce all its resolutions relating to the occupation
and to the fight against terrorism and those inciting
terrorism.
