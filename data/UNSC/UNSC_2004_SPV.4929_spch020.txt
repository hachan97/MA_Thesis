Mr. Negroponte (United States of America): The
killing of Sheikh Yassin has escalated tensions in Gaza
and the greater Middle East and sets back our effort to
resume progress towards peace.

However, events must be considered in their
context, and as we consider the killing of Sheikh
Yassin, we must keep in mind the facts. Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin was the leader of a terrorist organization, one
which has proudly taken credit for indiscriminate
attacks against civilians, including, most recently, an
attack last week in the port of Ashdod that left 10
Israelis dead. He preached hatred and glorified suicide
bombings of buses, restaurants and cafes. Yassin was
opposed to the existence of the State of Israel and
actively sought to undermine a two-State solution in
the Middle East.

The Security Council should not - and the
United States will not - support initiatives which
ignore this reality. The Security Council must not
remain silent about the actions of a terrorist group that
is dedicated to thwarting the Quartet road map, which
the Council endorsed in resolution 1515 (2003). The
Quartet envoys met yesterday in Cairo, and at this
critical juncture the international community must
remain focused on how to resume progress towards
peace. There should be no detours. One-sided,
unbalanced action by the Security Council can only
detract from Quartet efforts.

The United States remains committed to President
Bush's 24 June 2002 vision of two States. Working in
tandem with our Quartet partners, we call on both sides
to meet their responsibilities and obligations to fulfil
the vision of two States, Israel and Palestine, living
side by side in peace and security.
