Mr. Schulz (Germany): First of all, let me also
extend a very warm welcome to Ambassador Kelly
Craft, the new Permanent Representative of the United
States of America. Let me also thank Ambassador
Jonathan Cohen for the excellent cooperation, over the
past month in particular.

We welcome today's unanimous adoption of
resolution 2488 (2019). It sends a crucial and clear
message of unity, support and commitment to the
Central African Republic, its Government and its people.
We commend the Government of the Central African
Republic for the hard work, commitment and results
achieved over recent months. The Political Agreement
for Peace and Reconciliation in the Central African
Republic and the ongoing efforts to implement it, as
well as the overall political process, are positive signs.
We also acknowledge the Central African Republic's
work and progress on the benchmarks, especially given
the relatively short time since April, and we would like
to underline that we see this work as part of an ongoing
process. Therefore, we strongly encourage the Central
African Republic authorities to continue their efforts in
making further progress on the peace process, as well
as with regard to security sector reform, the process of
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, and the
management of weapons and ammunition.

We believe that the Security Council has an
obligation to maintain its support and commitment to
the Central African Republic. Therefore, it is crucial to
continue to closely follow developments in the Central
African Republic and to be ready to review the measures
of resolution 2488 (2019) at any time, especially in the
light of the security situation in the country.

Finally, we believe that the sanctions regime and,
in particular, sanctions against spoilers and those
responsible for sexual violence in conflict will remain
an important instrument in helping the Central African
Republic to achieve lasting peace and stability.
