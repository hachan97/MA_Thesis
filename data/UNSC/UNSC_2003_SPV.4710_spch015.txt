The President: Before giving the floor to the
next speaker, I again appeal to speakers not to exceed
the agreed time of seven minutes for a statement. The
matter is one of fairness to the speakers who follow. If
we stick to our timetable, everybody will have a chance
to make a statement to the Council.

The next speaker is the representative of Bahrain,
on whom I now call.
