Mr. Gaspar Martins (Angola): Today, we are
dealing with the conflict prevailing in one of the key
countries of our continent: Cote d'Ivoire, a country
described in the past as a symbol of prosperity and
stability in Africa and an important Member of the
United Nations. We therefore have the moral obligation
to contribute to its stability at a moment when the
tension among the parties has reached alarming
proportions.

We very much appreciate the constant efforts that
the Secretary-General, now present here, has made to
bring the parties to the table of dialogue.

We deplore the loss of life that has taken place
since the start of this conflict. My delegation is of the
view that, in such a tense and fragile environment, the
Security Council should opt for a kind of pressure that
will not radicalize the position of one or another party
but that will instead continue to stimulate dialogue.
The main concern at this moment is to find the
appropriate way to calm the tension and to bring the
parties back to the process of the implementation of the
Linas-Marcoussis and Accra III Agreements. That
should be the main - indeed, the only - objective of
the resolution we have just adopted.

My delegation joined the consensus, and we trust
that the resolution will represent a step forward in the
direction of peace and that it will encourage the parties
to resume a frank dialogue, as we in Africa know how
to do.
