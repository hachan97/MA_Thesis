The President: I thank Ms. Loj for her briefing.

There are no further speakers on my list. In
accordance with the understanding reached in the
Council's prior consultations, I should now like to
invite Council members to informal consultations to
continue our discussion of the subject.

The meeting rose at 10.40 am.
