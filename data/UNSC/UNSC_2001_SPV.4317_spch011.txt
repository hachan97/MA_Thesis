The President: I thank the Minister of Finance of
Burundi for his kind words addressed to me.

I shall now turn to members of the Council to
speak. It was important to hear the statements from our
guests this morning, particularly the Ministers. I would
like to note that I still have a number of speakers on my
list and the hour is growing late. I intend to suspend the
meeting between 1 and 1.15 pm. and to resume later in
the afternoon, because we obviously will not finish
now.
