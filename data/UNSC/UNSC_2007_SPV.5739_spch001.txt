The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the members of the Council that I have received
a letter from the representative of Timor-Leste, in
which he requests to be invited to participate in the
consideration of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the consideration of the item, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

On behalf of the Security Council, I extend a
warm welcome to His Excellency Mr. Zacarias Albano
da Costa, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation
of Timor-Leste.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Da Costa
(Timor-Leste) took a seat at the Council table.

The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by His Excellency Mr. Zacarias Albano da
Costa, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of
Timor-Leste, on whom I now call.
