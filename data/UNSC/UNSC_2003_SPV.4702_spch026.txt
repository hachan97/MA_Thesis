The President: I thank Mr. Steiner for the
clarifications he has provided and for the explanations
he has given us. We wish him well in his future work. I
hope that, in the meeting that will immediately follow,
we will be able to authorize a presidential statement
that will give him the support that he just requested.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.
