Ms. Menendez (Spain) (spoke in Spanish):
Preventive action and, in general, the maintenance and
building of peace require a global approach that
involves the international community as represented by
the United Nations, regional organizations, affected
Governments and their neighbouring States, as well as
civil society - which must always have an important
supporting role to play, as the General Assembly
emphasized last summer in its resolution 57/337, on
prevention of armed conflict.

We all agree that the best way to avoid the
outbreak of conflict is to build democratic societies in
which good governance and the rule of law are the
norm and in which economic growth is sustainable.
Here, the role of civil society is of great relevance.
Economic stability is a key precondition for the
consolidation of any peace process, and attaining such
stability is thus an essential objective that must be
reached through the concerted efforts of the authorities,
which must make rational use of natural resources, and
of civil society - and in particular the business
sector- which must participate responsibly in the
reconstruction process. When necessary, that must be
complemented by support from the international
community.

It is also essential that the business sector not
contribute to economies that support a given conflict.
Here, for example - and in accordance with Security
Council resolution 1343 (2001) - it is our view that
all Member States must take appropriate measures to
ensure that individuals and companies in their
jurisdictions observe the embargoes put in place by the
United Nations.
