Mr. Rycroft (United Kingdom): The lonely veto
and four votes in favour of your draft resolution, Sir,
were a double humiliation. This text was a cynical
attempt to divert attention from Russia's exercise of
the veto today that once again denied any hope to the
people of Aleppo. It failed because it failed to demand
an immediate end to the aerial bombardment of Aleppo.
It is a sham, just as Russia's hollow commitment to a
political process in Syria is a sham. The indiscriminate
bombing of civilians in Aleppo is sickening and
barbaric. Please stop now.
