Ms. Guo Xiaomei (China) (spoke in Chinese): Let
me begin by thanking President Fisher and Prosecutor
Hollis for their respective briefings on the work of the
Special Court for Sierra Leone. I would also like to
thank the Deputy Minister for her statement.

We note that since 2009 the Special Court has
continued to make substantive progress in its work. The
judgment in the final major case has entered its last stage.
The Special Court will become the first international
criminal tribunal to complete its mandate and close its
doors. We acknowledge the efforts made by the Court
over the years. We trust that its positive achievements
will serve as a reference for other international tribunals.
The Chinese Government has always supported the
work of the Special Court. We note that, in accordance
with the agreement between the United Nations and the
Government of Sierra Leone, when the Special Court's
work concludes, the small-scale Residual Special Court
will come into operation.

We expect the Special Court and the Residual Special
Court to continue to cooperate with the Government of
Sierra Leone and to contribute to the lasting peace and
national reconciliation of that country and the region
through their judicial and other activities. To that end,
we hope that the countries that are in a position to do so
will continue to provide financial support to the Special
Court, the Residual Special Court, Sierra Leone and the
other countries concerned.
