Mr. Maquieira (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): The
delegation of Chile voted in favour of the draft
resolution, as we condemn any act of violence,
whatever its origin and whatever argument is used to
justify it. It is particularly important to emphasize that
when civilian Victims are involved.

My delegation recognizes the right of Israel to
defend its people against terrorist acts, as long as the
measures it adopts for that purpose fall within the
framework of international law, including international
humanitarian law. Accordingly, we must speak out
against the excessive and unjustified use of force,
particularly against the civilian population.

My delegation once again appeals for caution and
for actions that are within the context of international
humanitarian law. We have also rejected the rocket
attacks by Palestinian groups against the Israeli civilian
population and urged the Palestinian Authority to take
steps to stop such attacks.

In conclusion, we would like to remind the
parties involved of their obligation to protect the
civilian population and of the need to put an immediate
end to acts of violence, whatever their origin. We
appeal to the parties to resume negotiations within the
framework of the road map.
