Mr. Le Hoai Trung (Viet Nam): It was with
profound grief that we learned of the crash of Malaysia
Airlines Flight MH-l7 in eastern Ukraine on 17 July,
which caused the tragic loss of the lives of all the
passengers and crew members. My delegation has
just been informed that, of the four victims whose
nationalities had not yet been identified when the
Ambassador of Malaysia spoke, three of them are
Vietnamese. We would like to convey our deepest
sympathy and condolences to the Governments, the
peoples and the bereaved families at this moment. As a
member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
Viet Nam stands in solidarity with the Government
and the people of Malaysia. The President, the Prime
Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister of Viet Nam have conveyed their deepest
condolences to the Government and the people of
Malaysia.

We call for expeditious, effective and responsible
actions by the relevant authorities and parties on behalf
of the families of the victims and in order to address
other related issues. Viet Nam also requests a prompt
and transparent investigation into the incident. We
hope that this incident will soon be resolved through
efforts and determination by the relevant authorities
and parties.

Viet Nam is closely following the situation in
Ukraine. We are extremely concerned about the recent
complicated developments in the eastern provinces
of Ukraine. We sincerely hope that all the parties
concerned will exercise restraint and avoid any actions
that could aggravate the situation and cause casualties
among civilians, while at the same time making efforts
through peaceful dialogue to find solutions that ensure
the legitimate interests of all parties and to meet the
people's aspirations for peace, stability and development
in Ukraine and the region.
