Mr. Jagne (Gambia): We support the draft
resolution before us in the conviction that, if we are really
concerned with and committed to the alleviation of the
suffering of the Iraqi people, we should aim at a more
comprehensive and integrated approach to the whole
question of Iraq. That is why my delegation believes also
that this is a question of resolve, and that the time has
now come to finalize the text of a comprehensive draft
resolution on Iraq.
