The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of
Afghanistan, in which he requests to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's
agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose,
with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the consideration of the
item, without the right to vote, in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Tanin
(Afghanistan) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council also have before them
document 8/2008/376, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Afghanistan, Belgium,
Croatia, France, Italy, the Russian Federation, the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and the United States of America.

It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
before it. IfI hear no objection, I shall now put the
draft resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Belgium, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, Indonesia, Italy, Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya, Panama, Russian Federation, South
Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain and

The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1817 (2008).
I now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
