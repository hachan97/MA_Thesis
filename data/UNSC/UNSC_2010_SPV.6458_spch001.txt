The President: I have received a letter from the
representative of Germany in which he requests to
participate in this meeting. I propose to invite that
representative to participate in this meeting without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

Participants have before them document
S/20lO/644, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by Austria, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, France, Gabon, Germany, Nigeria,
Turkey, Uganda, the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland and the United States of America.
I wish to draw the attention of members to
document S/2010/600, containing the twenty-sixth
progress report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Operation in Cote d'Ivoire.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
France, Gabon, Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria,
Russian Federation, Turkey, Uganda, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America

The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1962 (2010).

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.
