Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): Mexico
voted in favour of the resolution that was submitted to
the Council today because we believe that it is
indispensable to maintain the presence of the United
Nations mission in Georgia in order to preserve peace
in the region and the security of its inhabitants, while
bearing in mind the complexity of the overall situation.

Likewise, in previous consultations, we also
expressed our support for the proposal contained in the
Secretary-General's report to establish a new security
regime, which would enable us to prevent outbreaks of
violence and the use of force in the region. Given the
lack of agreement within the Group of Friends of
Georgia on the establishment of this new mandate, we
today supported the extension of the current Mission,
which, if it had been approved, would have enabled us
to continue with negotiations to bring about an
agreement acceptable to all parties and which would
have benefited the civilian population affected by this
conflict.

We regret that this technical extension of the
mandate was not approved by the Council, and we
continue to be available to participate in the forming of
agreements that can help us achieve the objectives
contained in the report of the Secretary-General, which
have been supported by all members of the Council.
What is in play in Georgia are the fundamental
principles of our Organization, such as the sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity of States and
respect for the rights of minorities. We will continue to
strive for dialogue and a peaceful solution to the
conflict in the region.

Finally, we reiterate our call upon all the parties
to not have recourse to force, in conformity with the
1994 Moscow Agreement on a Ceaseflre and
Separation of Forces and the peace agreements of
12 August and 8 September 2008. We call for a
solution to the conflict exclusively through peaceful
means in the framework of the pertinent resolutions of
the Council and in respect for international law.
