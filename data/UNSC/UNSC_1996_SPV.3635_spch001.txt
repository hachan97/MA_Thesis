The President: In accordance with the decision taken
at the 3634th meeting, I invite the representative of Cuba
to take a seat at the Council table.

At the invitation of the President, Ms. Cueto Milian
(Cuba) took a place at the Council table.

The President: The Security Council will now resume
its consideration of the item on its agenda.

Following consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council strongly deplores the
shooting down by the Cuban air force of two civil
aircraft on 24 February 1996, which apparently has
resulted in the death of four persons.

"The Security Council recalls that according to
international law, as reflected in Article 3 his of the
International Convention on Civil Aviation of 7
December 1944 added by the Montreal Protocol of
10 May 1984, States must refrain from the use of
weapons against civil aircraft in flight and must not
endanger the lives of persons on board and the
safety of aircraft. States are obliged to respect
international law and human rights norms in all
circumstances.

"The Security Council requests that the
International Civil Aviation Organization investigate
this incident in its entirety and calls on the
Governments concerned to cooperate fully with this
investigation. The Council requests that the
International Civil Aviation Organization report its
findings to the Council as soon as possible. The
Council will consider that report and any further
information presented to it Without delay."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/1996/9.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.

The meeting rose at 3.50 am.
