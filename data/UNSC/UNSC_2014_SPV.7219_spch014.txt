Mrs. ngu (Nigeria): I first want to say to our
colleagues whose citizens were involved that we convey
our deepest condolences to their families, citizens and
Governments.

Yesterday at noon, the world watched in horror
the downing of the Malaysian jetliner. What happened
yesterday seemed to be an apocalyptic end to the world.
I think Ambassador Power described it similarly. The
spectacle is graphically described, respectively, in
chapters 8 and 9 of the Book of Revelation: "hail and
fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the
Earth", "the sun and the air were darkened". That was
what I saw yesterday.

No matter our religious beliefs, that scenario may
become a self-fulfilling prophesy if States continue to
choose to open or support theatres of war and conflict
in every corner of the world. What will happen is that
the world will self-annihilate. Enough is enough.

The fact that this incident occurred as the plane
flew over eastern Ukraine, which, for some time now,
has been a zone of conflict, indicates that the accident
may be connected, in one way or another, to the conflict.
But this is not the time to play the blame game.

If it is established that the plane was shot down
deliberately, it will mark a new dimension in the
Ukraine crisis, one that represents a grave threat to the
safety of international civil aviation.

At this point, it is of critical importance for the
facts surrounding the crash to be dispassionately well-
ascertained. In that regard, we would like to express
our full support for an independent international
investigation, as called for by the Secretary-General.

Noting that the plane went down in an area under
the control of armed rebel groups, we urge that those
groups cooperate fully and unconditionally with the
investigation into the crash.

We have no doubt that, without the ongoing
conflict in Ukraine and the widespread insecurity and
lawlessness engendered by the activities of the rebel
groups in the eastern part of the country, this tragic
accident would not have occurred.

We want to renew our call for a cessation of
hostilities in Ukraine and a return to dialogue and
negotiation, within the framework of the Geneva
statement of 17 April and the 2 July four-party talks in
Berlin.

Let us together resolve this issue. Let us together
close this war front, before its reverberations become
manifest in other parts of the world.
