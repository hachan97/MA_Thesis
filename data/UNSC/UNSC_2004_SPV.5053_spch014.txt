Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
At the outset, I should like to express our shock at the
terrorist bombings in Egypt and in Pakistan, and we
convey our sympathy to the families of the victims. We
condemn these acts of terrorism.

Terrorism is the common enemy of humankind.
All forms of terrorism, no matter when or where they
occur and whatever their motivation, should be
combated with determination. The international fight
against terrorism should be consistent with the
principles and purposes of the Charter of the United
Nations and the underlying norms and principles of
international law. It should address both the symptoms
and root causes of the phenomenon while avoiding the
use of double standards. That has always been our clear
and consistent position.

There has been a recent spate of terrorist attacks
throughout the world. While the Security Council was
discussing the draft resolution on counter-terrorism,
resolution 1566 (2004), terrorism's reach extended to
Egypt and Pakistan. This is a flagrant challenge posed
by terrorists to the entire international community, and
it makes it clear that the fight against terrorism will be
a long and arduous one. The international community
must send a strong political signal in the context of the
combat against terrorism and improve the relevant
counter-terrorism measures in accordance with
changing circumstances.

China co-sponsored the resolution that has just
been adopted unanimously. The Chinese delegation
thanks the Russian Federation for having played a
leading role in drafting that resolution, and we would
like also to thank other Member States for their united
and consistent efforts.

China supports the leading role played by the
United Nations in the international fight against
terrorism. The unanimous adoption of this resolution is
a clear expression of our unity and a strong response to
the challenge posed by terrorism.
