The President (spoke in Russian): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic of
Iran in which they request to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives to
participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Farhcidi
(Afghanistan) took a seat at the Council table;
Mr. Ahmadi (Islamic Republic of Iran) took the seat
reserved for him at the side of the Council Chamber.

The President (spoke in Russian): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them document
S/ 1999/ 1054, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by Canada, the Netherlands, the Russian
Federation, Slovenia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland and the United States of America.

The first speaker on my list is the representative of
Afghanistan, on whom I now call.
