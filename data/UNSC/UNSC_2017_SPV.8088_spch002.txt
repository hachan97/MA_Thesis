Mr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Our delegation supported today's resolution
2383 (2017). We would note that there is a regional
link to the mandate extended by the resolution. That
approach has some positive aspects. At the same time,
in our View, combating piracy requires significant
comprehensive measures and a more global format.
Clearly, that would enable more effective crafting
of common approaches to fighting piracy and other
types of crimes at sea, as well as enabling an exchange
of experiences, including with regard to criminal
prosecution of pirates. We believe that the Contact
Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia could be the
most successful platform for such efforts.

Resolution 2383 (2017) underscores the fact that
piracy constitute and engine for corruption, terrorism
and other additional crimes. Maritime crime also
includes illegal trafficking in weapons and narcotics,
as well as other types of crimes. In practice, pirates are
frequently implicated in illegal activities that are not
directly linked to the seizure of vessels. In that regard,
in the foreseeable future, it would be wise for us to
consider optimal means of countering such threats.

In conclusion, we would like to stress that, on the
whole, the Security Council must continue to play a
leading political role in the fight against piracy. Work
along those lines is an example of the effectiveness of
the Council.
