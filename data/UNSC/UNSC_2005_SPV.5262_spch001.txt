The President: The Security Council will now
proceed to the consideration of its annual report to the
General Assembly, the draft of which has been
prepared by the Secretariat.

Members of the Council have received copies of
the draft report of the Security Council to the General
Assembly for the period from 1 August 2004 to 31 July
2005, as circulated by the Assistant Secretary-General
for Political Affairs on 31 August 2005.

I should like to express appreciation to the
Secretariat for the work it has undertaken in preparing
this factual report in a timely manner.

I now call on Mr. Tuliameni Kalomoh, Assistant
Secretary-General for Political Affairs, to make an
explanatory statement.
