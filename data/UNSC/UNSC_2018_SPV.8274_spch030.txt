The President (spoke in Russian): There are no
more names inscribed on the list of speakers. However,
before closing the meeting, I should like to say a
few words.

First, I would like to thank all of those who offered
words of support for the Russian presidency of the
Council for the month of June. We hope to have that
support throughout the course of our presidency.

Secondly, I should like to recall that in our
discussion, we neglected to mention that 1 June is the
International Day for Protection of Children. Most of us
have children, and I would like to congratulate everyone
on this holiday. We are all big children to one degree or
another, and it is therefore a holiday for all of us.

The meeting rose at 5.40 p.m.
