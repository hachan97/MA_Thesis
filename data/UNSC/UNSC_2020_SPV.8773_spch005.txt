The President: I wish to inform members that the voting in the Security Council was conclusive, but it was inconclusive in the General Assembly. The Council will therefore suspend the meeting and wait for the balloting process in the General Assembly to be completed. As soon as I receive from the President of the General Assembly the names of the five candidates who received the required majority, I will announce the full results of the voting in the Council and the General Assembly. The meeting was suspended at 5.05 p.m. and resumed at 12.45 p.m. on Thursday, 12 November.
