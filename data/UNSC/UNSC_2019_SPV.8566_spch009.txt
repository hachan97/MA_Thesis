Ms. Wronecka (Poland): Poland welcomes the
Council's adoption today of resolution 2479 (2019),
extending the mandate of the African Union-United
Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID)
until October. We would like to thank the United
Kingdom and Germany for their efficient conduct of
the negotiations on the document.

Poland supported the resolution because we believe
that given the current situation in the Sudan, we need
a pause in the process of the Mission's drawdown. We
remain supportive of the transition from peacekeeping
to peacebuilding in Darfur. Unfortunately, today
the Council is not in a position to make any long-
term decisions. We need more time to make sure that
our action will not have a negative impact on the
mission's efforts and gains made so far in Darfur. On
top of that, the African Union has urged us to halt the
reconfiguration process until after the joint strategic
assessment. Poland strongly supports the role of
Africa's regional and subregional bodies in resolving
disputes and conflict on the continent, and we therefore
took due account of the African Union's position during
the negotiations.
