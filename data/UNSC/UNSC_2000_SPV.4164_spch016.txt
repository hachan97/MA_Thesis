The President (spoke in French): I thank the
Permanent Representative of Portugal for his kind
words addressed to me.

The next speaker on my list is the Secretary-
General of the Council of the European Union and
High Representative for the European Union Common
Foreign and Security Policy, Mr. Javier Solana. I invite
him to take a seat at the Council table, and I welcome
him very warmly to speak for the first time before the
Security Council.
