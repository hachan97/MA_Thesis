Mr. Konuzin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We take a positive view of the draft regular
annual report of the Security Council to the General
Assembly. It provides useful and detailed information
on the activities of the Council in the course of the
year. We thank the Secretariat staff for the high level of
its professionalism and for completing its work on
schedule. We also thank the delegation of Singapore
for its contribution to this work.

We must note the somewhat relentless nature of
the Council's work. In the period under consideration,
we adopted 73 resolutions and 45 presidential
statements. There has been an increase in the number
of open meetings and broader use has been made of
open briefings. All of this demonstrates the increased
transparency of our work.

We believe it important that the report itself
clearly reflects the concrete steps taken by the Council
to improve its working methods. Also worthy of
approval is the fact that the report has become
significantly more compact. The principal innovation is
the analytical evaluation of the Council's work this
year, contained in the report's introductory section. At
the same time, we are of the view that the decisions
and resolutions of the Security Council speak more
objectively for its work.
