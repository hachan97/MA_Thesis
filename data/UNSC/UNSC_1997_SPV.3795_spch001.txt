The President (interpretation from Russian): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Angola, Argentina, Brazil, Lesotho,
Mozambique and the Netherlands in which they request to
be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Van Dunem
"Mbinda" (Angola) took a seat at the Council table;
Mr. Petrella (Argentina), Mr. Amorim (Brazil), Mr.
Nteso (Lesotho), Mr. Dos Santos (Mozambique) and
Mr. Biegman (Netherlands) took the seats reserved for
them at the side of the Council Chamber.

The President (interpretation from Russian): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
progress report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM. Ill),
documents S/l997/438 and Add.l.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/l997/498, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations.

The first speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of the Netherlands. I invite him to take a seat
at the Council table and to make his statement.
