The President (spoke in Russian): I should like
to inform members of the Council and other
participants that we are planning to meet until not later
than 7 pm. If there are speakers remaining on the list,
we will resume the meeting tomorrow morning.

The Security Council will now continue its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in response to the request contained
in the letter dated 6 April 2002 from the representative
of Tunisia to the United Nations, which is contained in
document S/2002/359.

The first speaker inscribed on my list is the
Permanent Observer of Palestine, to whom I give the
floor.
