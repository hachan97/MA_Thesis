The President: I shall put the draft resolution to
the vote now.

A vote was taken by a show ofhands.

In favour:
Bolivia (Plurinational State of), China, Egypt,
Ethiopia, France, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Russian
Federation, Senegal, Sweden, Ukraine, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
and Uruguay

Against:
United States of America

The President: There were 14 votes in favour and
one vote against. The draft resolution has not been
adopted, owing to the negative vote of a permanent
member of the Council.

I shall now give the floor to those members of
the Council who wish to make statements following
the voting.
