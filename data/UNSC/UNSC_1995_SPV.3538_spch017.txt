Mr. Yaacobi (Israel): From the outset, we believed
that this issue is for the parties concerned, based on the
Declaration of Principles which was signed by Israel and
the PLO. From the outset, Israel maintained that the
Security Council is not the appropriate forum in which to
address this issue and that, accordingly, it should take no
action in this regard. We therefore consider that the
outcome of these deliberations is appropriate.

Israel firmly believes that the main effort of the parties
should be directed towards the promotion of peace through
direct dialogue and negotiations. We call upon our partners
to work with us to accelerate the progress towards peace,
build mutual confidence, combat terrorism and implement
the agreements which have been signed.
