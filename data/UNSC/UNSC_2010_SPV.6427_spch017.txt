The President: I would remind people to keep
their statements to four minutes. Not a single person
has stuck to the designated time, and I will now crack
the whip. I will stop you if you go over the designated
time, so please keep your contributions to four minutes.
If there are written contributions, you can, of course,
circulate them.
