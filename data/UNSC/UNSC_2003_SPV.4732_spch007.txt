Mr. De La Sabliere (France) (spoke in French): I
welcome the presence of the Secretary-General, who
had warned us about these problems and who
supported us throughout the discussions, reminding us,
time and again, of the emergency nature of our work so
we would arrive at an agreement on the text as soon as
possible.

The French delegation is gratified at the result,
the adoption of this very important text to enable the
Iraqi people to receive the necessary food and medical
supplies as soon as possible. It was important that the
text recall principles, humanitarian law instruments, in
particular the Geneva Conventions, humanitarian
access to the populations and Iraqi sovereignty over its
resources. We also benefited from Mr. Benon Sevan's
assistance in order to find the necessary technical
adjustments to the oil for food programme in order to
meet the most pressing needs. We fully trust the
Secretary-General to implement the mandate we have
now entrusted to him.

The French delegation was a sponsor of this text.
It worked actively to ensure that the result would be
rapidly forthcoming. We were worried when
discussions lagged, and were very glad that results
were achieved. We would like to pay tribute to the
work of Ambassador Pleuger who helped us
tremendously in finding this consensus.

In conclusion, we are glad the Security Council,
on the basis of this humanitarian text, has recovered its
unity. That is also a very important result.
