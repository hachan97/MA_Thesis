The President: Let me just remind all colleagues
to speak for a maximum of four minutes. That enables
all to participate in the debate, which is the reason that
we impose a time limit. Speakers can take it for granted
that the presidency welcomes their thanks and gratitude
for organizing the debate and their congratulations on
assuming the presidency, which we have achieved by
dint of alphabetical order, and we also welcome their
appreciation of our wisdom in organizing this debate.
As a result, speakers may cut all of that from their
statements. I know that the next speaker will set an
example in that regard.

I now give the floor to the representative of Canada.
