The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Nepal and Norway, in which they
request to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Sharma
(Nepal) and Mr. Lovald (Norway) took the seats
reserved for them at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The President: Before giving the floor to the
next speaker, I should like to remind speakers of the
Council's earlier decision that interventions should, if
possible, be confined to just three minutes.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Sudan. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
