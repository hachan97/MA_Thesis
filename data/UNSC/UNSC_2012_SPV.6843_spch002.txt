Mr. Menan (Togo) (spoke in French): Togo welcomes
the adoption of resolution 2069 (2012), through which
the Council has decided to extend to 13 October 2013 the
mandate of the International Security Assistance Force.
We would like to thank the other Council members, in
particular Germany, for the efforts undertaken to that
end. At the same time, Whilejoining the consensus, my
delegation would like to explain its vote on two items.

First, Togo would like to have noted its reservations
with respect to the part of the eighteenth preambular
paragraph that stipulates:

(spoke in English)

"and remaining concerned at the serious harm that
opium cultivation, production and trafficking and
consumption continue to cause to the security,
development and governance of Afghanistan as
well as to the region and beyond".

(spoke in French)

The reference to "as well as to the region and
beyond", without any other geographical limitations,
would seem to generalize the impact of drugs in
Afghanistan as beyond the region and without limits.
Clearly, Togo, like other Council members, is very
sensitive to the issue of drugs worldwide in general and
in Afghanistan in particular. The open debate that was
held on 21 February under the presidency of Togo (see S/PV.6717) was illustrative of that concern.

We believe that while this phenomenon affects
Afghanistan's neighbours and States beyond the region,
we have had no indication to date that the impact of
drugs from Afghanistan extends to all regions of the
world. We should therefore have defined the geographic
extent of the phenomenon.

Secondly, my delegation fully understands the
rationale beyond the resort to the concept of agreed
language as a solution to ending the stalemate in
the negotiations. We nevertheless believe that the
agreed language should not be systematically used in
circumstances that differ from those for which it had
previously been adopted.
