France reaffirms its commitment to upholding the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and resolution 2231 (2015) of the Council, which endorsed it. Given our continued commitment to the JCPOA, we are extremely concerned by Iran's violations of its nuclear commitments under the agreement. We urge Iran to immediately reverse all measures that run counter to the JCPOA, and will continue our ongoing efforts under the JCPOA dispute resolution mechanism to bring Iran back to full compliance with its JCPOA commitments. We are also deeply concerned about Iran's destabilizing actions in the region, including its repeated violations of the provisions of resolution 2231 (2015) on conventional arms, with transfers to Yemen, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq, as well as non-State actors. In this context, the lifting of the United Nations embargo on conventional arms established by resolution 2231 (2015), scheduled for October this year, could have serious consequences for regional security and stability. We share the concerns expressed by several members of the Security Council and countries of the region on this issue. The Foreign Ministers of France, Germany and the United Kingdom have said this on several occasions and reaffirmed it in their statement of 19 June. However, France abstained in the voting on draft resolution S/2020/797 because it is not an appropriate response to the challenges posed by the expiration of the embargo and is not likely to advance security and stability in the region, owing to the lack of agreement among Council members, nor is it a suitable basis for working towards a consensus. We remain guided by the objective of respecting the authority and integrity of the Security Council and preserving regional stability and security and the nuclear non-proliferation regime. The period before the expiration of restrictions should be used to consider, in good faith, all diplomatic options.
