The President: I thank Mr. Chergui for his briefing
and his kind words addressed to me. I also thank the
African Union Peace and Security Council for the
excellent arrangements and hospitality extended to my
colleagues on the Security Council during our fourth
informal meeting and the thirteenth joint consultative
meeting of the Security Council and African Union
Peace and Security Council.

I now give the floor to Mr. Tomat.
