Mrs. Alingue (Chad) (spoke in French): First of all,
I would like to thank Jordan and the United Kingdom
for initiating the text of resolution 2201 (2015).

Chad welcomes the unanimous adoption by the
members of the Security Council of resolution 2201
(2015). This once again attests to Council unity in the
face of the serious situation prevailing in Yemen, which
is more than ever endangering the political process and
threatening the country's unity and cohesion.

We voted in favour of the resolution because it
seems to us to be strong, balanced and to the point.
It is strong in that it deplores the unilateral actions
taken by the Houthis and clearly calls on them to
immediately remove their forces from State institutions
and to normalize the situation in the capital and in the
country's provinces. It is balanced in that it calls on
all parties to engage in good faith in the negotiations
aimed at finding a solution out of the crisis in line with
the relevant provisions of the Gulf Cooperation Council
and its Implementation Mechanism, the outcome of
the National Dialogue Conference and the Peace and
National Partnership Agreement.

Against that backdrop, we call on all Yemeni
stakeholders immediately to implement the provisions
of resolution 2201 (2015), with a view to finding a
political solution to this crisis that can serve to overcome
all the threats to the country's security and stability.

We believe that Yemen can be governed only on the
basis of consensus. It is crucial that all the parties to
the conflict immediately engage in dialogue and avoid
turning to force to resolve their political differences.
We reiterate our full support for the efforts of Mr. Jamal
Benomar, Special Adviser of the Secretary-General,
aimed at arriving at a way out of the crisis.
