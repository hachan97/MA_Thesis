Mr. Poirier (France)(spoke in French): France
would like to express its satisfaction with the
information given us by the Special Representative of
the Secretary-General. In spite of the difficulties
pointed out, developments in the situation in Timor-
Leste have been positive ones. We would like to
transmit our congratulations to the Timor-Leste
authorities and to the United Nations Mission of
Support in East Timor (UNMISET) for the progress
achieved, both in the construction of an effective State
and in the process of the integration of the overall
South-East Asia region.

We are in favour of extending UNMISET's
mandate for another six-month period, as proposed by
the Secretary-General in his report, so that the Mission
might be able to fulfil its mission in support of the Dili
authorities.

France is and will remain especially attentive to
the efforts to be carried out in the next six months by
the Government of Timor-Leste and by the United
Nations Mission on the ground, so as ensure that
impunity does not prevail, as described by the
Secretary-General in paragraph 69 of his report.

Finally, we support the draft resolution submitted
by the delegation of Brazil. We submitted some
amendments to it this morning, which, I take it, are
currently in the process of being discussed among our
experts.
