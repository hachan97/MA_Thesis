Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
The Chinese delegation wishes to thank the Secretary-
General for his report as well as Assistant Secretary-
General Annabi for his additional briefing.

Since the beginning of this year, some progress
has been made in the overall situation in Kosovo. The
Provisional Institutions are now relatively familiar with
their operations and core functions. The United Nations
Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK),
according to chapter 5 of the Constitutional
Framework, has transferred relevant responsibilities to
the Provisional Institutions.

However, Kosovo still faces many grave
challenges. For instance, organized crime is on the
increase, and hand-grenade and other attacks targeting
UNMIK have taken place. Overall economic activities
are on the decline, and the unemployment rate remains
high. Ethnic minorities remain at a disadvantage and
are often subjected to violence, harassment and
discriminatory treatment. All of this shows that there is
a long way to go in order to meet all the benchmarks.
We hope that the local leadership of Kosovo will take
account of overall interests, fully cooperate with
UNMIK and the Government of Serbia and
Montenegro in order jointly to make Kosovo into a
society characterized by social stability, economic
development and ethnic harmony.

According to the report of the Secretary-General,
from time to time comments are made regarding the
status of Kosovo. The Chinese delegation is concerned
about these comments. We believe that Security
Council resolution 1244 (1999) remains the
international community's policy basis with respect to
the question of Kosovo.

The resolution should be implemented effectively.
We call on all parties to act with caution and to refrain
from any comment or action that undermines the peace
and stability of the region.
