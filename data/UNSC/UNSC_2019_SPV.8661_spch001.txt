The President: In accordance with rule 39 of
the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite
the following briefers to participate in this meeting:
Mr. Jean-Pierre Lacroix, Under-Secretary-General
for Peace Operations; Ms. Marie-Joseph Fitah-Kona,
Adviser to the Mayor of the Third Arrondissement of
Bangui; Mr. Awale Abdounasir, Police Commissioner of
the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; Ms. Mary
Gahonzire, Police Commissioner of the United Nations
Interim Security Force for Abyei; and Mr. Issoufou
Yacouba, Police Commissioner of the United Nations
Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission
in Mali. I offer my apologies to all of them for
any mispronunciations.

Ms. Fitah-Kona is joining the meeting via video-
teleconference from Bangui.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

The intention of this meeting is for us to be as
interactive as we were during the same briefing in
November 2018 (see S/PV.8393) and as we try to be
during our dialogue with the Force Commanders. We
are looking forward to questions from Council members
to the Commissioners, and from the Commissioners
to the Council, which is why I am going to ask my
Council colleagues to show excessive discipline and
keep their statements brief so as to give more time to
the Commissioners to respond. I would therefore also
ask our briefers to try to be as brief as possible.

Setting the tone will be Mr. Jean-Pierre Lacroix, to
whom I give the floor.
