The President: I thank the Permanent
Representative of Tajikistan for his kind words addressed
to me.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless
I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the
vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on the Permanent Representative of
the Russian Federation, who wishes to make a statement
before the voting.
