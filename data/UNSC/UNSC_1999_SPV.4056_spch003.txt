Mr. Shen Guofang (China) (spoke in Chinese): Since
the Security Council adopted resolution 1159 (1998) last
year, which authorized the establishment of the United
Nations Mission in the Central African Republic
(MINURCA), the situation in the Central African Republic
has remained peaceful and stable. National reconciliation
has achieved positive results and work on various fronts has
been proceeding in a smooth and orderly manner.

We have also noticed that various destabilizing factors
still exist in the Central African Republic. National
economic reconstruction and the restructuring of the Central
African Armed Forces (FACA) are yet to begin.

MINURCA'S continued presence in the Central
African Republic for a period of time is of course highly
necessary. In this regard, the Chinese delegation fully
supports the recommendation of the Secretary-General to
extend the mission, as well as the draft resolution
of the Council based on the Secretary-General's
recommendations.

We believe that the extension of the Mission and the
future establishment of a United Nations office in Bangui
will contribute to national reconciliation and economic
reconstruction in the Central African Republic. The
Chinese delegation will therefore vote in favour of the
draft resolution before us.
