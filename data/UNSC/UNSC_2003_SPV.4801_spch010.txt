Mr. Aguilar Zinser (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish):
The Security Council has reached consensus on a
resolution regarding Western Sahara, an item that has
been on the Council's agenda for a very long time
without agreement among the parties on a settlement.
Having cast a positive vote, my delegation would like
to reiterate what we believe to be the two main
principles governing United Nations actions in
reaching a solution to this long-standing problem.

First, there is the principle of self-determination,
which must not be abandoned as an essential element
in pursuit of a just resolution of this issue. The second
is the fact that the parties and the international
community have opted for a negotiated solution. The
job of the Council, the Secretary-General and his
Personal Envoy, Mr. James Baker, is to explore every
avenue potentially conducive to a negotiated
settlement.

Today's resolution constitutes progress on both
those counts, in that it reaffirms the principle of self-
determination and seeks a negotiated settlement.
Possible elements of agreement can be discerned in
that progress. The Council has expressed its view that
the Baker plan has obvious merit and my delegation
shares that View. The resolution very clearly and
justifiably points that out. Although there is not yet
complete agreement among all the parties on that
proposal, we nevertheless believe that the plan should
be the conceptual and substantial basis to ensure that
the mediation sponsored by the Secretary-General and
being carried out by Mr. Baker can now make progress
towards agreement.

We are convinced that there is now a new
opportunity to achieve a lasting solution to this
problem.
