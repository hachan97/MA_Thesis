Mr. Fall (Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs) (spoke in French): The draft report
before the Council has been prepared and presented
both in conformity with Articles 15 and 24 of the
United Nations Charter and in line with the revised
format agreed upon by the Security Council in 1974
and further revised in 1985, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997
and 1998.

The draft report presents the activities of the
Council in a concise manner. It should be noted that, in
addition to the extensive coverage provided in part V
on the work of the subsidiary organs of the Council, the
annual reports of the sanctions Committees are to be
found in appendix XII of the report, in accordance with
the note by the President of the Security Council of 30
October 1998. Further, pursuant to the understanding
reached in the Council's consultations of the whole on
30 November 1998, the statements to the press made
by the President following consultations of the whole
of the Council have also been included in an annex.

Finally, as the President has pointed out, the draft
report before the Council was distributed by the
Department of Political Affairs on 21 August 2000.
Subsequently, the Secretariat took note of a number of
proposed changes, which have been transmitted to the
members of the Council as a corrigendum.
That concludes my very brief introduction of the
draft report to the Council.
