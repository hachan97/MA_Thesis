The President (spoke in Spanish): I appeal to
representatives who have yet to take the floor kindly to
be as brief as possible. There are nine speakers left. If
we proceed quickly, we may be able to finish this
morning, as we had hoped. Otherwise we may have to
suspend and return at 3.15 pm. Once again I urge
delegations who have yet to take the floor to be brief.

The next speaker on my list is the representative
of South Africa, I invite him to take a seat at the
Council table and to make his statement.
