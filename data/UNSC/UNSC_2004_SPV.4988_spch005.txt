Mr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): My
delegation welcomes the recent conclusion in
Naivasha, Kenya, of the three protocols to agreements
that, along with those reached over the past two years,
now pave the way to a peaceful settlement of the
conflict that has gone on too long in the southern
Sudan.

While we welcome the efforts undertaken by the
parties to the conflict and the regional and international
mediators, which may lead to a restoration of lasting
peace in the southern Sudan following the dashing of
many earlier hopes, my delegation remains aware of
the fragility of the process under way, the challenges
confronting it, and the danger that it may be knocked
off track at any moment. As the Secretary-General very
clearly indicates in his report, the parties to the conflict
and the international community must display
unshakeable will and steadfast resolve if we are to
bring the peace process in the southern Sudan to a
conclusion.

In order to thwart all those who would wish the
process to fail in pursuit of their objectives and to
avoid the various potential obstacles, significant
human, financial and material means must be
mobilized, keeping in mind the geographical, political,
social and economic constraints. Such are the
challenges to the implementation of the agreement
protocols already concluded and of an eventual
comprehensive agreement. At this critical phase,
therefore, my delegation would call for a mobilization
of resources and a focusing of energy to accompany the
peace process in the southern Sudan so as to avert any
possibility of failure.

Without denying the importance of challenges in
other regions in the immense territory of the Sudan,
which also deserve a comparable mobilization effort
and the full attention of the international community
and of the Sudanese parties involved, my delegation
should have liked the resolution to guarantee ongoing
international mobilization to accompany the peace
process under way in the southern Sudan.

In that spirit, my delegation fully endorses the
Secretary-General's recommendations, particularly
those pertaining to the deployment of an advance team,
with the prospect of establishing a United Nations
operation after the conclusion of a comprehensive
peace agreement in the southern Sudan.
