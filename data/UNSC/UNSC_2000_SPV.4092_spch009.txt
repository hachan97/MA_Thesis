The President: I thank the President of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo for his very important
statement, and I appreciate very much his coming to the
United States for this discussion about his country. I also
thank him very much for his kind words addressed to the
American presidency.

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Jose
Eduardo dos Santos, President of the Republic of Angola.
