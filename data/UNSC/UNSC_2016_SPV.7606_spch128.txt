Ms. Shilo (Israel): During the past four months,
Israelis have been stabbed in their homes, shot at in the
streets and run over by terrorists using cars as weapons.
Over the course of that wave of violence, 29 people were
killed and hundreds were injured. One would expect that
the Palestinian Authority would condemn the terrorist
activities by Hamas and others and stop the increasing
incitement. Instead of condemnation - instead of
taking responsibility - the Palestinian leadership,
unfortunately, has once again preferred to attack Israel.
Since it is the easiest way to get attention, I would like
to be clear.

Israel's commitment to the protection of civilians
knows no colour, no ethnicity and no borders, and will
always remain absolute. The Palestinian observer spoke
here today about a resolution from 30 years ago. Instead
of searching the United Nations archives for solutions
and resolutions, I would like to remind him that, only a
year and a half ago, the Palestinians refused to accept a
Security Council resolution that would have improved
the lives of their people and enabled the Palestinian
Authority to go back to Gaza.

It seems that the Palestinian people do need
protection - protection from the choices of their
leadership, protection from their lack of foresight
and from their refusal to go back to negotiations.
Unfortunately, rather than restoring the rule of law and
improving the lives of the people of Gaza and the West
Bank, the Palestinian Authority choses to side with
terror. It is so sad, so counter-productive.
