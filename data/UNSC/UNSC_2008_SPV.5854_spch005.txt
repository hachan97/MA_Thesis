The President (spoke in Russian): I thank the
representative of Myanmar for his statement.

There are no other speakers on my list. In
accordance with the understanding reached in the
Council's prior consultations, I should now like to
invite Council members to informal consultations to
continue our discussions on the subject.

The meeting rose at 5.45 p.m.
