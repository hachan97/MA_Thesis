Ms. Tshabalala (South Africa): We supported the
request for this meeting on the basis of consistency,
having acceded to requests from other delegations
for briefings on matters that they regard as urgent
and important. We also support the meeting based on
the fact that Ukraine is on the agenda of the Security
Council and on rule 2 of the provisional rules of
procedure, which provides for such a meeting.

With regard to the matter brought to our attention
today, South Africa continues to encourage all the
parties to strengthen all their diplomatic efforts to avert
an escalation of tensions and work for an inclusive,
sustainable and peaceful solution based on cooperation
and dialogue. We want to encourage all the parties
to approach their dialogue in a spirit of compromise,
in order to move the process forward. My delegation
would like to reiterate that a failure to implement
the existing agreements will unfortunately lead to
unintended consequences. In this regard, we emphasize
the obligations of all the parties to fully implement their
respective commitments under the Minsk agreements,
which provide the most promising road map for the
peaceful settlement of the current hostilities, including
in eastern Ukraine, and to advance the cause of peace
and stability in the border region.
