Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
Allow me at the outset to join previous speakers in
expressing my deep condolences to the Governments of
Afghanistan and Pakistan over the tragedy that has
struck them.

China listened carefully to the statements made
by this morning's three briefers. They were extremely
detailed and very helpful to our understanding of the
situation in Afghanistan. Many of our colleagues have
already raised a number of questions, some of which
were similar to those I had in mind. I will therefore not
repeat them.

I want to ask only two questions. My first
question is for Mr. Guehenno. In his briefing, he
referred to the repeated attacks against United Nations
and other international personnel. One agency has
suffered two grenade attacks; fortunately, there were no
casualties. Have any specific measures been envisioned
to reduce the incidence of such attacks?

My second question is for Mr. Braun, who
mentioned in his briefing that Afghanistan is already a
member of the International Criminal Police
Organization (INTERPOL). Does Mr. Braun have any
specific plan to take full advantage of INTERPOL in
building the police force in Afghanistan?
