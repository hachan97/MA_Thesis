Ms. Citaku: I will try to be very brief.

First, many members of the Security Council raised
the issue of the murder of Mr. Oliver Ivanovie. On
behalf of the Kosovo Government, I want to reiterate
that we will leave no stone unturned until we find the
perpetrators of that terrible crime. Mr. Ivanovic' was a
citizen of Kosovo. He was among the few local Serbian
leaders who spoke openly about Pristina as the capital
of the Serbs living in Kosovo. He spoke openly against
intimidation and the threat to which local Serbs were
subjected by the authorities in Belgrade. We ask for the
cooperation of all the parties. I hope that I will soon
come to the Council with results.

Secondly, I need to reiterate that Kosovo's
independence is not the product of a secessionist
movement. Kosovo's independence is the product of
the non-consensual dissolution of Yugoslavia - a
union that no longer exists. I urge whoever has any
doubts about the legality of Kosovo's independence to
read the advisory opinion of the International Court
of Justice (sec A/64/881). The opinion was clear and
unambiguous. It is true that Kosovo is a very young
State, but we are also a very old nation. We can point to
any given date in history. We have always existed. We
are Europeans and we are proud ofthe friendships and

alliances that we have with all members. I hope that
Kosovo will soon establish diplomatic relations also
with Serbia.

The meeting rose at 12.45 p.m.
