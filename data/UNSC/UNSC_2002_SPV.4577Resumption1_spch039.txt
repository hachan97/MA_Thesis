The President: On that last point, I know that the
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is
beginning to distribute the report of the Inter-Agency
Standing Committee Task Force on Protection from
Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in Humanitarian Crises,
which is something - in terms of its peace and
security aspects - which the Council may want to
come back to, for instance, in our debate on conflict
and gender on 25 July.
