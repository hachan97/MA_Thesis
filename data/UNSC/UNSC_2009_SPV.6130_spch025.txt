Mr. Inzko: I wish to cordially thank you, Sir, and
everybody for their support and for all of their input,
ideas, suggestions, analysis and kind words of
welcome to me in my new function. I also thank
Council members for their offers to continuously
cooperate with me and with my Office.

I also thank the Council for its support on the
ground in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the Peace
Implementation Council, the Contact Group, the
European Union military mission, the police mission and
other configurations, including past European Union
presidencies, the current Czech Presidency and the fiiture
22
presidencies of Sweden and Spain. I also thank all
neighbouring States for their support.

As far as the statement of Prime Minister Spirie
is concerned, two sentences caught my attention. First,
Mr. Spiric' said that imposing a system of governance
by international organizations would not be legally
valid. Secondly, he said that democracy and the rule of
law cannot develop if principles of democracy and the
rule of law are not observed by the international
community.

Those are quite serious allegations, but believe
me, I do not take it personally because I have been in
Bosnia for only two months. But I must protect my
predecessors - Carl Bildt, Carlos Westendorp, Wolfgang
Petritsch, Lord Ashdown, Christian Schwarz-Schilling
and Miroslav Lajcak - who did an excellent job based
on the Dayton Peace Agreement and on the decisions of
the Security Council, which gave full support to the
implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement. In that
respect, I will not accept any challenges to the Dayton
Agreement and I think this should stop. It is exactly such
rhetoric and such allegations that have delayed the closure
of the Office of the High Representative.

In any case, I am still optimistic and I think that
based on the next meetings of the Peace Implementation
Council at the end of June and in October, we will be able
to report further progress.
