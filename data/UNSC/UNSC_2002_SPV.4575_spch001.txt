The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Kenzo Oshima, Under-Secretary-
General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency
Relief Coordinator.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Oshima to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

At this meeting the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Kenzo Oshima, Under-Secretary-
General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency
Relief Coordinator.

May I remind the Council that the background to
this meeting is that the Council continues to await with
great interest the report by the Secretary-General
following the recent inter-agency mission to Angola.
Since that report has been held up, the Council recently
agreed with the Secretary-General's recommendation
that the mandate of the United Nations Office in
Angola should be rolled over for one month upon its
expiry on 15 July. We expect that a full discussion of
Angola will be arranged by the United States
presidency in August in good time for the new mandate
renewal date.

But given the urgency of the humanitarian
situation, Council members felt that it would be useful
to have a briefing from Mr. Oshima, who has also
visited Angola recently, without waiting for the fuller
discussion next month. Mr. Oshima has kindly found
time in a very busy schedule. We will not be able to
detain him more than about an hour, but I hope that
following his initial presentation, there will be time for
a brief question-and-answer session. Those Council
members who wish to take the floor in that sense
should so indicate to the Secretariat from now on.
I give the floor to Mr. Oshima.
