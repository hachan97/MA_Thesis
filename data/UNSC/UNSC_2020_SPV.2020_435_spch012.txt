Venezuela is in the midst of a tense political standoff and socioeconomic collapse, which risks being highly exacerbated by the devastating impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on the population. We regret to note that the polarization in Venezuela has continued to deepen and to abort attempts of reaching a negotiated solution between the main political actors. We are concerned also to note that the current stand-off and the absence of any space for serious negotiations between the parties is potentially undermining the stability of the region, where tension is looming as well. This is the third time in less than a month that the situation in Venezuela is on our agenda, but we regret to note that the Council, despite the good intentions of its members, is not speaking with the same voice on this issue. The divisions in the Council will not help us walk Venezuela to stability. Tunisia remains convinced that a negotiated political solution through the efforts of Venezuelans and their political leaders is the only way forward. This is even more important in the context of the COVID-19-pandemic. We stand ready to support any initiative of the Security Council in this regard, as well as any good offices of the Secretary-General, should they be requested. We call on all the main actors to put aside mistrust and animosities and to work on durable solutions that would strengthen democratic governance and meet the aspirations of all Venezuelans to peace and welfare.
