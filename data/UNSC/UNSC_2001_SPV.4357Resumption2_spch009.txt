The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank Mr.
Hajihosseini for his kind words addressed to me.

Before calling on the next speaker, I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Mexico in which she requests to
be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council' s provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Ms. Lajous
(Mexico) took the seat reservedfor her at the side
ofthe Council Chamber

The President (spoke in Spanish): The next
speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of
Namibia. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table
and to make his statement.
