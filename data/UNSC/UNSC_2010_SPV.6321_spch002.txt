Mr. Mayr-Harting (Austria): Austria voted in
favour of the resolution although we would have
preferred a more gradual approach to be taken in the
drawdown of the United Nations Mission in the Central
African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT), as well as
the continuation of a protection of civilians mandate
for the Mission. At the same time, we note and
underscore that MINURCAT has at least been
authorized to respond to imminent threats of violence
to civilians in its immediate vicinity.

We respect the decision of the Government of
Chad to assume full responsibility of the security and
stability of the civilian population in eastern Chad,
including refugees, internally displaced persons,
returnees and host communities. We appreciate the
efforts undertaken by the Chadian authorities to provide
the Security Council with a better understanding of
their plans and capabilities in this field. We trust that
the Government of Chad will do its utmost to fulfil its
responsibilities and use all available capabilities for the
protection of the population in Eastern Chad.

At the same time, it is of the greatest importance
that the joint Government of Chad/United Nations
high-level working group assume the key role provided
for in the resolution and regularly assess the situation
on the ground with respect to the protection of civilians
and humanitarian access. We call upon the Government
of Chad and the Secretariat to cooperate as closely as
possible within the working group.

There is a continued need for the Council to
follow developments closely and to be regularly
informed about the situation on the ground. Austria
believes that the possibility of a further international
10-37507
engagement in eastern Chad should not be excluded if
deemed necessary for humanitarian reasons.
