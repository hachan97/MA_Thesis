Mr. Quinlan (Australia): Like all of us, Australia
has watched the events in eastern Ukraine with
mounting concern. What we have seen unfold is a
coordinated operation where well-trained and well-
armed paramilitary units have moved quickly to lay
siege to, occupy and control key institutions in five
or six towns in Donetsk province. The violence in
Sloviansk has led to one death and nine wounded. The
stakes are obviously dangerously high. This has not
been a spontaneous, grassroots, broad-based protest
movement by local inhabitants; rather it is a pattern
of highly orchestrated destabilization by pro-Russian
groups. Those groups have included units of highly
trained armed men with Russian military equipment,
operating without identifying insignia. Those units
have used force to storm and besiege local Government
buildings and institutions.

If all that sounds familiar, it is because we have
seen the playbook used by Russia in Crimea. In that
case, it became clear that the militias were in fact
Russian forces. We condemn any use ofproxy forces. A
State cannot seek to avoid responsibility for its actions
by attempting to cloak the identity of those working on
its behalf. The principles of State responsibility make it
very clear that a State bears international responsibility
for acts undertaken by informal actors whom it engages
on its behalf.

We have heard Russia's statement about the crisis
taking place in eastern Ukraine, but what we are
actually witnessing is Violence and destabilization in an
effort to manufacture a sense of crisis and separatism.
Ukraine's response to those provocations has been one
of restraint under intolerable threats to its stability and
independence. There is no evidence of actions directed
at Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine that could
possibly justify an intervention by Russia. Nor is there
the generalized anarchy claimed. The ongoing work of
the special mission of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe is all the more important
for providing an objective account of the situation in
eastern Ukraine, and we welcome the information that
the number of monitors will be significantly increased
in coming days.
International condemnation of Russia's actions
against Ukraine in the past six weeks has been
resounding. General Assembly resolution 68/262
unambiguously condemned the threat and use of force
in this manner as contrary to the Charter of the United
Nations and to Russia's specific treaty obligations to
Ukraine. Many countries, including my own, have
imposed unilateral sanctions to register the depth of
their concern. Repeated calls for de-escalation have
been ignored.

Russia's major military build-up along Ukraine's
eastern border has been a significant and deliberation
provocation that only further escalates tensions and
the likelihood of conflict. It deepens Russia's own
isolation and also, of course, strengthens the resolve of
the international community to stand with and support
Ukraine as it seeks to maintain its sovereignty and
territorial integrity. The only way forward, as we all
know, is de-escalation, dialogue and the free elections
that are planned for 25 May. And Ukraine must be
allowed to prepare for those elections without the
interference and coercion we are witnessing.

But talks can take place only with genuine
commitment and good faith on all sides. The talks
between Russia, Ukraine, the European Union and
the United States planned for 17 April are an essential
step in that direction, but can take place successfully
only on that basis. Attempts to change the facts
on the ground are completely contrary to dialogue
and peaceful resolution. We call on Russia to work
immediately to reduce tensions, stop its destabilization
and withdraw its forces from the provocative posture
they have assumed on Ukraine's border. We have heard
assurances in the past that Russia will take such action.
It now really is imperative that it do so.
