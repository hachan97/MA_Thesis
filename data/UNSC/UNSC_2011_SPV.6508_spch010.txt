Mr. Parham (United Kingdom): This unanimous
resolution sends an important message about the firm
resolve of the international community to see a swift
resolution to the political crisis in Cote d'Ivoire. It
responds to an urgent situation. Events are moving fast
on the ground. The security situation continues to
deteriorate. And the position of civilians is of
increasing concern. I would like to highlight four main
points in the resolution.

First, it condemns the violence in Cote d'Ivoire
and calls for the implementation of a political solution.

Secondly, it explicitly calls for Mr. Gbagbo to
step aside to enable such a solution and calls for all
Ivorian State institutions, including the Defence and
Security Forces of Cote d'Ivoire, to yield to the
authority vested by the Ivorian people in President
Ouattara.

Thirdly, it specifically targets Mr. Gbagbo and
those close to him for financial sanctions and travel
bans. Such measures are in support of the African
Union's efforts to find a political solution, and respond
to the calls made to the Security Council by the
Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) in its communique of 24 March. The
United Kingdom supports the continued efforts of the
African Union and ECOWAS to implement a peaceful
transfer of power and to avoid violence.

Fourthly, the resolution also reinforces action to
protect civilians. It does not alter the robust mandate of
the United Nations Operation in Cote d'Ivoire
(UNOCI), under which the Operation is already
authorized to use all necessary means to protect
civilians, but it does reaffirm UNOCI's role in
protecting civilians and preventing the use of heavy
weapons against civilians. It also underlines the
importance of the protection of civilians by all parties.
