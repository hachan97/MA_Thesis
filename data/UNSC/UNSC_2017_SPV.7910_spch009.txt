Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We join others in conveying our condolences
and sympathies following the deaths of the two
young and courageous experts, Michael Sharp and
Zaida Catalan.

Russia voted in favour of resolution 2348
(2017), extending the mandate of the United Nations
Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO). We believe that,
during this difficult time in the country's political
history, it is important for the Mission to continue to
carry out its work in stabilizing the eastern areas of
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and facilitating
the implementation of the political agreement of
31 December 2016. We believe that all of that will
be carried out by the Mission in full respect for
Congolese sovereignty.

At the same time, we are not pleased with the
approach taken in deciding to reduce the size of
MONUSCO. In that regard, the Russian delegation
initially proposed identifying tasks that could be
discontinued without prejudice to the performance of
the mandate or that could be delegated to the country
team, only thereafter reducing the number of Blue
Helmets deployed. We regret that financial and sheerly
numerical considerations prevailed.

We are also concerned about the plan to have two
parallel cycles of reporting to the Security Council on
the activities of a single peacekeeping operation, as
set out in the resolution. We believe that the solution
that was forced through by the informal leads on that
issue could negatively affect the implementation of
peacekeepers' mandate and result in problems with
regard to the organization of the Security Council's
work. We trust that our colleagues will follow their own
stated understanding whereby the Secretary-General's
submission of updates on the implementation of the
internal Congolese agreement will not automatically
mean holding Security Council consultations.
