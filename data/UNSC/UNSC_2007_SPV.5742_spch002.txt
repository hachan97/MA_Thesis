Mr. Rogachev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation shares the
understanding reached in the Security Council on the
need to defer until the end of the present year the
consideration of the question of the appointment of a
new Prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal
for the former Yugoslavia. There were several possible
ways to resolve this generally technical issue.
However, the option introduced in the Security Council
seems to us to be the least successful one.

The Russian delegation has frequently expressed
doubts as to whether Ms. Del Ponte understands her
mandate properly. Instead of carrying out the
professional duties of a jurist employed by the
international community to support an impartial
prosecution in the Tribunal, the current Prosecutor's
priority has become assuming the functions of some
kind of quasi-political player having the audacity to
write a prescription in the area of international
relations. This has been significantly assisted by the
fact that, in our eyes, the Tribunal has increasingly
assumed features of a non-transparent, biased and
costly organ of international justice.

The situation regarding the International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia requires urgent
correction. We must pin our hopes on the new
Prosecutor of the Tribunal, who will assume the post in
three and a half months' time.
