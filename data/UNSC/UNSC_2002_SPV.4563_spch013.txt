Mr. Ryan (Ireland): Ireland supports absolutely
the extension of the mandate of the United Nations
Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the
authorization of the Stabilization Force. We therefore
voted in favour of the draft resolution. We understand
the concerns of the United States with regard to the
International Criminal Court, in particular its concerns
relating to United States personnel serving in United
Nations missions. However, we cannot agree with the
decisions at this point on the part of the United States
regarding these concerns. We have said all along that
we will work with others pragmatically to address
these concerns, and that remains our position. We
regret very much that this has not proved to be possible
today due to an absence of agreement in the Council.

Ireland has ratified the Rome Statute of the
International Criminal Court, and is therefore bound by
its provisions. Ireland amended its constitution so that
it could ratify the Rome Statute. We are also strongly
committed to the Common Position of the European
Union in relation to the International Criminal Court.
The implications of the vote that was taken earlier are
extremely serious - for the United Nations and this
Council; for United Nations peacekeeping; and for the
people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, we
welcome Ambassador Negroponte's reiteration today
of the United States commitment to peacekeeping in
the Balkans and elsewhere. We note carefully that
unambiguous commitment.

We, the members of the Council, in meeting the
situation that has now arisen, must seek to move
forward urgently as best we can. I convey my
Government's strongest support for the concerns
