Mr. Vassilakis (Greece): The Security Council
has just adopted resolution 1583 (2005), extending the
mandate of the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon for another six months. I would like to
emphasize the cooperative spirit that prevailed during
its preparation. The unanimous adoption proves the
Council's feeling that the situation that continues to
prevail on the ground is still threatening peace and
security in the area.

There is one element the resolution about which
we would like to express some thoughts. It is well
understood that the increased number of peacekeeping
operations worldwide, with an ever-expanding range of
activities to be carried out, has created an urgent need
to review the structures of current peacekeeping
operations so as to achieve greater operational
efficiency through the utilization of limited resources.
The review of peacekeeping operations should
nevertheless be carried out in accordance with
objective criteria and the existing conditions on the
ground and should be defined by factors of substance
after assessment of the risks involved in each specific
situation. Needless to say, the opinion and views of the
host country play an important role and should be
taken into consideration appropriately.
