Mr. Seifi Pargou (Islamic Republic of Iran): It
is not surprising that, once again, the Ambassador of
the child-killer regime, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,
has tried his best to divert the attention of the Council
from the realities on the ground in Syria and the region
in order to cover up its crimes against the peoples of
the region, particularly innocent children in Yemen.
Similarly, by accusing others, the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia desperately wants to divert attention from its
support of terrorism in the region and the world.

Saudi Arabia is the main ideological, financial
and logistical source of the most dangerous terrorist
groups in our region, namely, Al-Qaida, Da'esh and the
Al-Nusra Front. The chief example of this is its support
for those terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq. What it is
doing is in gross deviation from Islamic teachings and a
flagrant violation of international law, thereby flouting
its international responsibility. Accordingly, the Saudis
must be held to account for all their support of terrorism
and for all the other crimes they are committing in the
region, from Syria to Yemen. Instead oflying, spreading
misinformation and preaching to others, that abnormal
regime must stop supporting terrorists, killing innocent
children and destroying mosques, schools and hospitals
in Yemen and elsewhere in our region.
