The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as representative of Japan.

I would like to thank France for its leadership in
preparing resolution 2303 (2016). Japan welcomes its
adoption.

Yesterday, during the open debate on peacebuilding
in Africa (see S/PV.7550), we heard the representatives
of many Member States express their concerns over the
situation in Burundi. We must not allow Burundi's hard-
won progress to vanish after a decade of peacebuilding
efforts. It is time for the Council to take concrete
action. I believe that Council members are united in
their commitment to supporting the political process in
Burundi, in close cooperation with the African Union
and the East African Community, in order to halt the
violence and human rights violations and to prevent a
further deterioration of the situation.

Let me underscore one point. Japan believes that
the deployment of the United Nations police component
authorized under today's resolution will help not only
the Security Council to closely monitor the situation on
the ground and deter any degradation of the situation,
but also the Government of Burundi to rebuild mutual
trust with its international partners. In that regard,
Japan calls on all the Burundian parties to extend their
full cooperation to the United Nations, including the
United Nations police component.

Japan, as a long-term development partner of
Burundi, sincerely hopes that Burundi will find a
way forward out of the current crisis and chart a
renewed course towards stability and prosperity in the
near future.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

The representative of Egypt has asked to make a
further statement.
