Ms. Wronecka (Poland): Let me begin by thanking
His Excellency Mr. Aleksandar Vucie, President
of the Republic of Serbia, for his presence at the
Security Council today. I also welcome His Excellency
Mr. Hashim Thaci, President ofthe Republic of Kosovo.
I would also like to thank Under-Secretary-General
Lacroix for his briefing. I will now make the following
statement with regard to the issue at hand.

We recognize that the transition of the Kosovo
Security Force is in principle a matter for Kosovo
to decide. However, we stress that it is of the utmost
importance that the future armed forces of Kosovo be
formed through an inclusive and gradual process, while
respecting the relevant provisions of the Constitution.
Then and only then can they serve the security interests
of all communities.

In our assessment, recent developments do not in
and of themselves constitute a threat to international
peace. We trust that all political actors in the region
will act responsibly and refrain from any statements or
actions that may lead to escalation. We welcome the
restraint shown thus far.

We also reiterate our conviction that lasting stability
in the region can be achieved only through continued
dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina under the
auspices of the European Union, which should lead
to a legally binding agreement on the comprehensive
normalization of relations.
