Mr. Colak (spoke in Bosnian; interpretation provided by the delegation): I will be very brief. I
should like to thank all those speakers who expressed
their support and their belief, based on the report of the
High Representative and on my report, that Bosnia and
Herzegovina has taken positive steps on the path
towards European and Euro-Atlantic integration.

I agree that we still have two very important
obligations to fulfil: full cooperation with the
International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia, and police restructuring in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. Those tasks must be carried out in full,
because they are vital to our process of integrating into
European and Euro-Atlantic structures.

I want to make clear that, when I mentioned the
problem of the process of return, which has not yet
been resolved, I did not say that 10,000 Croats had not
yet returned to the area; I said that 10,000 Croats had
left the area since 1999 - that is, in the past five
years.

I believe that similar problems exist elsewhere,
but I chose to underline this as one of the more drastic
examples. When I spoke of the Court of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, my intention was not to make any
statement contrary to the truth - and I did not do so.
My goal is to ensure that my country - my
homeland - establishes the rule of law and adopts
European standards, and I am convinced that this will
happen.

I have no intention other than to state real facts.
My goal - and, I believe, that of the High
Representative - is the establishment of an
independent judiciary and the rule of law. I am
convinced that Bosnia and Herzegovina will soon
achieve that goal.
