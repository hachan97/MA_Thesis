Mr. Cheng Jingye (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
join other speakers in strongly condemning yesterday's
attack against the International Committee of the Red
Cross.

The Chinese delegation thanks Mr. Sevan for his
detailed and comprehensive briefing. We highly
appreciate the arduous work of the Office of the Iraq
Programme and all those involved in the phase-out of
the oil-for-food programme, under special, very
difficult circumstances. The successful phasing out of
the programme directly concerns the humanitarian
needs of the Iraqi people and the practical interests of
suppliers from various countries. We hope that the
parties concerned will work together to ensure an
orderly, transparent and comprehensive transfer of
responsibilities.

In this connection, I wish to emphasize two
points. First, we have taken note of the fact that
approximately 52.4 per cent of the contracts have been
amended. We believe that it is necessary to ensure that
the amendment of the remaining contracts is
completed. Secondly, we believe that it is necessary to
accelerate the authentication of goods. We also believe
that, after 21 November, the Coalition Provisional
Authority should take effective measures to ensure the
ongoing implementation of the authentication

procedure.
