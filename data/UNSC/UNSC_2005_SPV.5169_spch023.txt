Mr. Pahad: We want once again to take this
opportunity to thank the Council for its consistent
support for Africa's efforts to resolve the Cote d'Ivoire
crisis. I wish also to express our profound thanks to the

African Union Chairman, President Obasanjo, for his
consistent support for the mediation.

Again, I want to express our appreciation for the
positive and constructive statements that have been
made today. It is clear that, through our collective
efforts, progress has been made in Cote d'Ivoire, but
that, as has been said, many challenges remain. Africa
therefore looks forward to working with the Security
Council, the United Nations Operation in Cote d'Ivoire
and the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General, Mr. Schori, to ensure that we achieve a long-
lasting solution. That is very important because, as we
all know, cote d'Ivoire is very strategically situated,
and positive developments there will have a positive
impact on the whole region.

I also believe that, if we succeed in achieving
peace and stability in Cote d'Ivoire, it will also have a
positive impact on other countries that are emerging
from conflict and attempting to work towards creating
conditions for their elections. I refer here, inter alia, to
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and
the Sudan. I am confident that the Council, being
conscious of its responsibilities, will take the necessary
decisions to ensure that elections do take place in Cote
d'Ivoire by 31 October 2005.

We leave New York emboldened by the fact that
the Council has indicated its support for the peace
process in Cote d'Ivoire and that it will remain seized
by Africa's efforts to find a solution. We look forward
to a peaceful and stable Cote d'Ivoire because, as I
have said, it is in the interest of all of Africa and it will
have a massive positive impact on our efforts, as
Africans, to find African solutions to the conflicts in
Africa.
