Mr. Al-Tememy (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): At the
outset, I would like to address a message ofthanks to all
the members of the Security Council for the visit they
paid to Kuwait and Iraq. That visit was timely, as Iraq
needs the support of all the members of the international
community. The message is also addressed to the whole
world and all peoples: that Iraq has been able to get
back on the right track, overcome all the shocks of
the past and achieve a developed state of democracy
that has proved to the world the awareness of the Iraqi
people in this respect and the progress made in terms of
democratization according to international standards.

Iraq has proved to all the peoples of the world that
it is continuing to fight terrorism and that it has fought
it for five years now. We have fought a terrorist group
that controlled 30 to 40 per cent of Iraqi territories, and
through the blood of Iraqi martyrs we have been able to
prove to the world that Iraq remains a safety valve not
only for the region but also for the whole world.

Once again, I thank the Council for its visit, and we
look forward to cooperation in broader areas leading to
reconstruction, stability and security in the region.
