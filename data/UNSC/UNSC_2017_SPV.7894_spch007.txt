The President: I thank the Deputy Secretary-
General for her briefing.

Traditionally in these briefings on Security Council
missions it is just the co-leads who speak, but of course
all Security Council members are entitled to request
the floor. Several members have done so. Allow me to
encourage those who have done so to be brief, given the
agenda that we have ahead of us this morning.
