The President: I shall now make a brief statement in
my capacity as representative of the Netherlands.

As the former colonial power in the region, the
Netherlands has always been reluctant to criticize the
Government of Indonesia. It goes without saying that by
today's standards, our colonial history has seen its share of
human rights violations. But as a Member of the United
Nations, and of the Security Council in particular, we are
directly involved in the 5 May Agreement concluded by
Indonesia, Portugal and the United Nations.

We are shocked at the way Indonesia has failed to
fulfil its obligations under that Agreement. I refer, in
particular, to the obligation Indonesia has itself insisted
upon, that is, its obligation to maintain peace and security
in East Timor until it has taken the constitutional steps to
terminate its links with East Timor. In view of all the
looting, burning and killing, the focus of this Security
Council meeting has naturally been on Indonesia's failure
in the perseveration of security. This does not detract,
however, from our determination to ensure that the 5 May
Agreements are implemented in full. Indonesia must now
accept the offer of military assistance by the international
community.

I resume my function as President of the Council.
There are no further speakers on my list. The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council will continue its consideration of the item
following the return of the Council mission from
Indonesia.

The meeting rose at 6:20 pm.
