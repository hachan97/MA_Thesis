Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I apologize for
taking the floor once again, but I do not think that we
have heard an answer with regard to the hospitals. I
want to return to that. We are very clear. We do not
support terrorism or terrorist acts, and we agree with
the representative of Germany that the attacks on
Russian bases should be condemned. I also wanted to
say, however, that the Al-Assad regime is not leading
and has never led the fight against Da'esh. It is the
Global Coalition that cleared Da'esh from Raqqa.

The Syrian Ambassador also talked about the
Syrian regime only taking legal measures and having
responsibility for protecting civilians in Idlib. I
therefore ask once again: What is the answer concerning
the hospitals? If only Russia and Syria are flying
aeroplanes over Idlib, what is happening with regard
to the targeting of hospitals? I believe that we need
further information. We need to know if the hospitals
are being deliberately targeted, we need to know if the
deconfliction mechanism is not working, and we need
to know what is going to be done to stop the attacks on
the hospitals. Where are the assurances to halt attacks
on hospitals, health facilities and schools in areas in
which ordinary people, not terrorists, live? What is
being done to stop those attacks?
