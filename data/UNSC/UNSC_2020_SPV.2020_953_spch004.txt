It is great to be with the Security Council and discuss the post-coronavirus disease (COVID-19) governance in our global world. First of all, I would like to reiterate Estonia's support for Secretary-General Guterres's call for a global ceasefire and call on everybody to support it by the end of the year. COVID-19 has changed our world and, true to Estonian colours, I would like to point out that technological development is the area that helps us to maintain the coherence of our world and to continue to cooperate with each other. In addition, this pandemic has shown us that our world of work, education, communication and services has radically changed. What do we need to do now? We need to adapt our global governance model to what we are seeing in the real world. This is also true if we wish to make this global opportunity a golden opportunity potentially for those countries that are looking to leapfrog and for those people who have the skills to participate in the global services market, but who happen to come from the countries where it is difficult to offer their services to the rest of the world and for those in world, notably women and people with disabilities, who have found it very difficult to participate in the job market previously. Now, in this post-COVID world, it has been proven that you do not have to be where you are working. This is a golden opportunity for the weaker sectors of our society. We have to understand that we have to give our children and adolescents the opportunity to learn the skills necessary to participate in this new world of technology. Finally, we do not need national or regional governance structures, such as the European Union, but rather a global governance structure that will create a legally permissive environment for all these developments, including, of course, the necessary cyber security.
