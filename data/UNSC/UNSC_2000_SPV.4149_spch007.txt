Mr. Listre (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): The
Argentine Republic voted in favour of the resolution
extending the mandate of the United Nations Mission
for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) to
31 July 2000. However, it profoundly regrets the fact
that, despite the efforts that have been made, it was not
possible to achieve a consensus text. We feel that we
came very close. My delegation, along with others
seated around this table, made serious efforts to
achieve it. In this regard, I wish to pay particular
tribute to you, Mr. President, for your endeavours to
achieve this, demonstrating once again the skill and
intelligence with which you have conducted our work
throughout this month.

Argentina reaffirms its support for the settlement
plan. We believe that every effort should be made to
find a mutually acceptable arrangement within that
plan. In our view, significant progress has been made in
its implementation. We are aware of the difficulties
involved. At this stage, we feel that the most important
aspect relates to the issue of appeals, but we do not
believe it to be an insurmountable obstacle.

We therefore call on the Kingdom of Morocco
and the Frente POLISARIO to give their broadest
cooperation to Mr. James Baker, the Personal Envoy of
the Secretary-General, and to demonstrate a
constructive spirit of cooperation in order to find
mutually acceptable solutions within the settlement
plan. Argentina believes that other alternatives to the
settlement plan can be considered only once all the
possibilities for agreement within it have been
exhausted, ensuring that all parties consent to any
consideration of other negotiating approaches.
