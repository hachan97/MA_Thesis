Mr. Li Yongsheng (China) (spoke in Chinese):
With regard to the affairs of the international tribunals,
including the question of the International Residual
Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, China has always
been objective and fair, and has avoided involving its
self-interest.

Based on our support for the decision of the
Secretary-General, our expectations of fairness
and high efficiency in the functions of the Residual
Mechanism and its principals in accordance with the
law, considerations with regard to the continuity of
the Tribunals and the need for the Security Council to
complete the appointment of the Prosecutor in a timely
manner, China voted in favour of the resolution.

At the same time, China takes note of the concerns
of several countries with regard to the appointment
of the President of the Residual Mechanism and
the nomination of the Prosecutor. We hope that
those concerns will be duly considered and that the
appointment and nomination of the principals of the
Residual Mechanism will be more fair and transparent
in future. China also hopes that the Residual
Mechanism and its principals will strictly implement
the relevant Security Council resolutions and execute
their functions in a fair and efficient manner, so as to
earn the confidence of the international community.

The meeting rose at 3.30pm.
