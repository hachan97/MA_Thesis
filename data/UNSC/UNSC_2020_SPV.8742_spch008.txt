Mr. Singer Weisinger (Dominican Republic) (spoke in Spanish): The Dominican Republic welcomes the stated intent of all Afghan parties to work towards the success of an inclusive intra-Afghan political agreement and a definitive and comprehensive ceasefire within the framework of the signed Joint Declaration between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the United States of America for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan and the Agreement for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan between the United States of America and the Taliban. This historic agreement, signed by the United States of America and the Taliban, seeks to put an end to this protracted conflict. We therefore voted in favour of resolution 2513 (2020), which we have just adopted, because we believe that the text is balanced and marks the historic moment of the signing of the peace agreement. We also recognize the great deal of hard work done by the co-drafters on the resolution. The Dominican Republic deems crucial the effective and meaningful participation of women, young people and minorities. We urge the parties to ensure that any political agreement reached protects the rights of those groups. To conclude, we would like to commend the support shown by the delegations that are members of the Security Council with respect to the adoption of the resolution. By the same token, we believe that the cooperation of the United Nations will remain vital in the context of the various peace talks to help make the most of existing dialogues and to address issues relating to a reduction in violence and the promotion of a ceasefire. The Dominican Republic believes that the resolution contains the tools necessary for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, the Government and the international community to be able to continue to work to bring about lasting peace and stability in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.
