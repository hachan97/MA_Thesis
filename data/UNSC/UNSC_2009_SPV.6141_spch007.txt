Mr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): As a party to
all major multilateral treaties on nuclear disarmament,
including and especially the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, Viet Nam is
faithful to the objective of non-proliferation of nuclear

weapons, considering it to be not only an effective
platform for achieving the final goal of totally
eliminating nuclear weapons from the world but also
an indispensable tool for guaranteeing the existence of
an environment favourable to the promotion of the use
of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.

As a party to the Treaty on the South-East Asia
Nuclear Weapon Free Zone, Viet Nam is also a strong
advocate of the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free
zones in every part of the world, and, in that spirit, it
has strongly supported the efforts made to achieve the
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, which serves
the long-term interests of peace, security and stability,
not only of North-East Asia, but also of the wider
region.

Viet Nam shares others' concerns about the
nuclear test conducted by the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea on 25 May 2009 and joins the
Security Council consensus on measures to resolve the
Korean nuclear issue through peaceful negotiations,
especially through the Six-Party Talks. At the same
time, during the Council's deliberations on the issue,
Viet Nam has insisted that, while the Council intends
to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the
development of ballistic missile technologies in
accordance with resolution 1718 (2006), the measures
to be adopted by the Council must avoid adversely
affecting the normal livelihood of the people of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as well as the
humanitarian, development and other legitimate
economic activities of and in the country.

Having voted for resolution 1874 (2009), we wish
to emphasize that the resolution reaffirms the Council's
commitment to a peaceful, diplomatic and political
solution to the situation. We support every effort by
Member States to promote a comprehensive solution
through dialogue, including the Six-Party Talks, and to
refrain from actions that might aggravate tensions.
