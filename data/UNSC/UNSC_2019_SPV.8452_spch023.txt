Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Since the representative of Germany devoted
a major part of his statement to speaking specifically to
me, I would like to make a few comments.

The use of preventive diplomacy is excellent. It
is of course better to prevent a crisis than to resolve
it. However, putting forward an absurd eight-day
ultimatum is a very strange way of proposing how to
prevent the crisis. Some States did not even need eight
days to reject recognizing the legitimate authorities of
Venezuela. They completely disregard the sovereignty
of Venezuela, while imposing decisions on it that they
prefer. They have refused its people the right to resolve
their problems on their own. They are not calling on
the political forces in Venezuela to find common
understanding with a view to achieving internal peace
and stability. Rather, they are calling on the legitimate
authorities to simply acknowledge their defeat and
transfer power to the opposition. That is not called
prevention; it is known as incitement.

How would they feel if the Russian Federation
proposed discussing in the Security Council the issue
of the situation in France and the protests staged by
the gilets jaunes - approximately 22,000 people
took to the streets over the past weekend? Would that
be considered prevention? I would like to reassure
the representative of France that we do not intend to
propose such a discussion. Unlike France, however, we
are not trying to recognize or not recognize anyone.
Nonetheless, we recognize the legitimate authorities
of Venezuela. We call for, first, respect for legitimate
authority; secondly, non-interference in the domestic
affairs of the country; and, thirdly, the non-imposition
of outside solutions on Venezuela. Instead, we propose
that we help its people find a peaceful resolution to
their problems on their own.
