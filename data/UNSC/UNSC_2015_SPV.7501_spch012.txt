The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as representative of Nigeria.

Nigeria notes that the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) Fact-
Finding Mission mandated to establish the facts
surrounding the alleged use of chemical weapons in
Syria has concluded "with a high degree of confidence"
(S/2015/138, annex 2, para. 29) that toxic materials
have been used as a weapon in Syria. We also note that
the Fact-Finding Mission does not have the mandate
to attribute responsibility for those actions, which
constitute a gross violation of international law. That
lack of attribution has left a gap that must be filled in
order to determine those behind the use of chemical
weapons in Syria. Resolution 2235 (2015), which the
Security Council has just adopted unanimously, seeks
to fill that gap through an OPCW-United Nations Joint
Investigative Mechanism. That is why Nigeria voted in
favour of its adoption.

Wedeemitnecessarytoaffirmthat,whilewesupport
the establishment of a Joint Investigative Mechanism,
we have neither preconceptions nor prejudices
concerning who is behind the chemical weapons
attacks in Syria. We are confident that those facts can
be established by the Joint Investigative Mechanism.
Our wish is to see to it that the perpetrators are brought
to justice. We call on all parties in Syria - and, indeed,
on the international community - to cooperate with
the Joint Investigative Mechanism in the execution
of its mandate. We reaffirm our strong condemnation
of the use of chemical weapons by anyone under any
circumstances.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

I give the floor to the representative of the Syrian
Arab Republic.
