Mr. Tafrov (Bulgaria) (spoke in French):
Bulgaria welcomes the adoption of resolution 1483
(2003) because it will enable the Iraqi people to regain
full control of their future. The Bulgarian delegation
was very happy to participate in the discussions leading
to the adoption of the present resolution: a very
constructive spirit reigned during the discussions,
making possible a genuine dialogue among Council
members. The sponsors of the original draft resolution
listened to the concerns of other Council members,
who, in turn, were able to respond with a willingness to
compromise that ultimately proved very useful.

Bulgaria welcomes the adoption of the resolution
because the United Nations is to play a vital and
independent, even central role in resolving Iraq's
problems during the post-conflict period. Problems will
be resolved through a genuine partnership between the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General and
coalition forces. We have complete confidence in the
Secretary-General as he selects his Special
Representative, and we promise him my country's full
support in the Security Council and on the ground.

Beyond the question of Iraq, we must recognize
that in this period of globalization, the United Nations
has become an essential, indispensable organization. If
the United Nations did not exist, we would have to
invent it.
