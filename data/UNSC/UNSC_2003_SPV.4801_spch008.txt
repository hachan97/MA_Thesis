Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
The Chinese delegation has always believed that the
authority of the Security Council stems from its unity.
We are therefore pleased to note that, in the spirit of
compromise and cooperation, and after numerous
consultations, we have finally adopted the present
resolution on Western Sahara. That once again proves
that, with sufficient political will, consensus is always
attainable. We hope that the spirit of consensus will
continue to prevail in our work.

China has always been concerned about the issue
of Western Sahara. It has been our hope that this matter
could be resolved in a fair and equitable way, within
the framework of the United Nations.

China supports and appreciates the efforts made
by the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy,
Mr. James Baker. We also wish to thank all the parties
concerned for their tireless efforts to find a solution to
this problem. We hope that that the parties concerned
will continue to act in the spirit of pragmatism. We also
hope that this long-standing problem can be resolved as
soon as possible through dialogue and consultation, for
the sake of peace and development in the Maghreb
region.
