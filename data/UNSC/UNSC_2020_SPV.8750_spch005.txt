Mr. Bencosme Castafios (Dominican Republic) (spoke in Spanish): At the outset, we would like to congratulate France on its efforts to prepare and seek points of convergence among member States in order to reach consensus on the adoption of resolution 2536 (2020). The Dominican Republic voted in favour of the resolution primarily for the following reasons. First, the resolution maintains a balance by recognizing the efforts made by the authorities of the Central African Republic to achieve progress on the key benchmarks related to security sector reform, programmes for the disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and repatriation of ex-combatants, and the management of weapons and ammunition, which were established as a guide for the Security Council in reviewing, suspending or progressively lifting the arms embargo. The resolution also addresses the need for the authorities of the Central African Republic to be equipped in order to effectively combat the armed groups and maintain peace and stability in the country. Secondly, the 12-month extension of the sanctions regime and the mandate of the Panel of Experts, which standardizes the regime's cycle, will allow sufficient time for the authorities of the Central African Republic to fully implement the benchmarks, as well as for the Secretary-General and other actors on the ground to provide more comprehensive reports. Furthermore, it will prevent the renewal process from taking place in the middle of an electoral process, allowing the Central African Republic to focus its actions during the coming months on conducting peaceful presidential and legislative elections. Thirdly, the Dominican Republic also hopes that the embargo will maintain pressure on the armed groups, discouraging them from committing crimes and violating international humanitarian law and human rights law. Finally, the Dominican Republic calls on the authorities of the Central African Republic to continue to make progress on the benchmarks by effectively managing their weapons and ammunition, particularly rocket-propelled grenades, so as to prevent them from falling into the hands of armed groups and being used against civilians, complete the peace and reconciliation processes under way and lay the foundations for a possible eventual lifting of the embargo.
