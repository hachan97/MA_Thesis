The President: I should like to inform all
delegations concerned that, taking into account the
limited number of speakers remaining, thanks to the
efficient use of time so far, I will not suspend this open
debate for lunch as planned earlier. It is my intention to
continue until the last speaker.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Costa Rica.
