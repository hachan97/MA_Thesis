Mr. Tumysh (Kazakhstan): My delegation abstained
in the voting on resolution 2428 (2018) because it does
not reflect the positions and concerns of the countries
of the region and the relevant regional organizations,
the Intergovernmental Authority on Development
(IGAD) and the African Union, with regard to the
timing of these actions. We want to point out that on
30 June the IGAD Council of Ministers decided that
it was not helpful to pursue punitive measures at this
stage. We highly commend the concerted efforts of the
United Nations, the African Union and IGAD, as well
as the mediation efforts of the countries of the region
that helped to secure the Khartoum Declaration.

My delegation believes that despite today's adoption
of resolution 2428 (2018), it is critically important to
ensure that the Council remains united in its support
for the efforts of IGAD and the African Union to
achieve peace and stability in South Sudan. We must all
stand up for a greater role for regional organizations in
the Security Council's work and support them in their
efforts to achieve progress.

We also urge the Government and opposition in
South Sudan to work proactively and genuinely to
implement the agreement and continue their inclusive
and constructive peace talks to resolve the outstanding
issues relating to governance and security arrangements.
As an observer member of the African Union, we want
to express our solidarity with the position expressed by
the representatives of Ethiopia and Equatorial Guinea.

Lastly, we would also like to welcome the new
Permanent Representative of Cote d'Ivoire and to
cordially wish him every success in all his endeavours.
