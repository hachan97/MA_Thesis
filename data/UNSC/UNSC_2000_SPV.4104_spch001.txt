The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
and Portugal in which they request to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's
agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose,
with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Mwamba
Kapanga (Democratic Republic of the Congo) took a
seat at the Council table; Mr. Monteiro (Portugal)
took the seat reserved for him at the side of the
Council Chamber.

The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, contained in document S/2000/30.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2000/ 143, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of members of the
Council to the following documents: S/2000/67 and
S/2000/ 122, letters dated 28 January and 11 February 2000,
respectively, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo;
5/2000/73 and S/2000/89, letters dated 26 January and 3
