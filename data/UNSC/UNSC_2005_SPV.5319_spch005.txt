The President: May I, on behalf of the Council,
thank Mr. Forster and the ICRC for all the work that
they do.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I would urge all speakers to
limit their statements to no more than five minutes in
order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with longer statements are
kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing and to
deliver a condensed version when actually speaking in
the Chamber.

As agreed in prior consultations, I intend to
follow an alternating speaking arrangement, giving the
floor to groups of three Council members and then
alternating with the same number of non-Council-
members. Procedurally, I will not invite speakers
individually to take their seats at the Council table, nor
will I invite them to take their seats afterwards at the
side of the Council Chamber. While members of the
Council are speaking, the conference officer will seat
the next group of non-members at the Council table.
