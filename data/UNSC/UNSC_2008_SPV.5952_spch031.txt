Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Who would object to a ceasefire? Who would
object to peace? Of course, peace is better than war.
But unfortunately, in this kind of situation, you cannot
just get away with slogans. You need a serious political
analysis of the situation. You not only need an appeal
to cease combat; you need to state that agreements
have been violated, agreements that have maintained
the peace in that conflict area over the past 14 years.
You need demands to be met and the situation returned
to that which existed before the start of Tbilisi's
aggressive actions against South Ossetia. That would
be a serious political approach. But simply to present
fine slogans in these meetings and then do everything
you can to nod indulgently at Tbilisi is not the way that
will lead to a settlement of this very acute, very
dangerous conflict situation.
