The President: In accordance with rule 39 of
the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite
Mr. Nickolay Mladenov, Special Coordinator for the
Middle East Peace Process and Personal Representative
of the Secretary-General, to participate in this meeting.

Mr. Mladenov is joining today's meeting via video-
teleconference from Jerusalem.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

Recalling the Security Council's latest note 507 on
its working methods (S/2017/507), I wish to encourage
all participants, both members and non-members of the
Council, to deliver their statements in five minutes or
less. Note 507 also encourages briefers to be succinct and
to focus on key issues. Briefers are further encouraged
to limit initial remarks to agreed time limits.

I now give the floor to Mr. Mladenov.
