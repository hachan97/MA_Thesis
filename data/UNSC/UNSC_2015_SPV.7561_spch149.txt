Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I will be brief. I agree with my Ukrainian
colleague that the primary responsibility of the Security
Council is finding solutions to problems, however
complex they may seem.

As it happens, the Minsk agreements, as affirmed
in resolution 2202 (2015), do indeed represent a format
that provides for a solution. The main thing is to ensure
that they are implemented in their entirety, and not
selectively, without picking and choosing only those
provisions that are to the liking of one side alone.
