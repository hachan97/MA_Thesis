Mr. Touray (Sierra Leone): I have asked for the
floor to place on record my Government's profound
appreciation for the interest and efforts, as well as
the collective wisdom, of the Council in trying to
put my country on the right track. We thank the
members of the Council for the unanimity they
have again shown in the adoption of resolution 2097
(2013) a moment ago, and want to assure the Council
of my Government's cooperation and commitment
towards its full implementation. We look forward to a
seamless transition and transformation, structural and
functional, of the United Nations peacebuilding efforts
in the country.
