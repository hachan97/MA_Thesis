The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Australia, Brazil, Japan, Malaysia,
New Zealand, the Philippines, Portugal and Timor-
Leste in which they request to be invited to participate
in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda.
In conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with
the consent of the Council, to invite those

with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
