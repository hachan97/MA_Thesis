Mr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): The Ukrainian delegation
voted in favour of resolution 2336 (2016) today for
one reason, which is that it focuses on establishing a
ceasefire regime. While numerous questions linger
about the scope and substance of all the understandings
reached in Ankara on 29 December, we support all
efforts to put an end to the bloodshed and alleviate the
suffering of the Syrian people. In that regard, we would
like to stress that, in order to make the ceasefire work,
the necessary level of confidence and trust - which is
clearly missing after so many years of the conflict in
Syria - must be established among all the parties. The
latest reports of fighting in Wadi Barada testify to the
fragility of the situation.

Although it is a part of human nature to hope for the
best, given the track record ofbroken ceasefires and the
deficit of trust in one of the guarantors ofthe latest one,
at this point we would caution the Council to be prudent
and to keep a watchful eye on further developments as
we enter the new year.

As this is hopefully the last time we will meet under
the Spanish presidency, let me conclude by expressing
our sincere thanks and congratulations to the delegation
of Spain for its dedicated efforts and leadership during
this difficult month.
