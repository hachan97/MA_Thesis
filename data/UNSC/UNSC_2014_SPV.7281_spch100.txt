Mr. Nitzan (Israel): I will be very brief. We are
familiar with the Palestinian delegation's selective
descriptions of the reality on the ground. They are
probably the result of selective hearing. We said it
earlier today, we say it in each and every meeting, we
say it every day: this is our dream, we want peace.
Unilateral steps by the Palestinian delegation here or by
the Palestinian Authority, which are designed to incite
violence in Jerusalem, will not give us peace; it will
actually distance us from peace.
