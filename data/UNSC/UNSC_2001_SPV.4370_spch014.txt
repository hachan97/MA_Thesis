Mr. Kolby (Norway): On behalf of the
Norwegian people and Government, I would like to
express my deepest condolences to the President, the
Government and the people of the United States of
America. Many lives were lost in yesterday's senseless
and cowardly acts against innocent people. Our
thoughts and prayers are with all citizens of this
country, and I would like to assure the United States
that Norway stands ready, both as a member of the
community of nations and as a close friend and ally, to
assist you in every way possible.

Yesterday's attacks were not only directed against
targets in the United States, but against freedom and
democracy itself. The shameless terror was an effort to
undermine the values that constitute the very
foundations of the civilized world. The attacks were
therefore directed against all of us.

President Bush has made it clear that the United
States will ensure that the perpetrators of these horrific
attacks will be pursued and will face the full might of
the law.

It is important that a unified Security Council
now take appropriate steps. This Council was
established to defend these values and must show that
it is ready to support efforts to do just that.

11 September 2001 is a day that will live in
history - not because terrorists managed to shake the
foundations of democracy, but because it was once
again proved that democracy and freedom will prevail
against all evil. Countless people among the members
of the New York police and fire departments and rescue
workers here in the city and in Washington, DC. and
Pennsylvania proved themselves to be true heroes. We
are grateful to them all, and we all feel like true New
Yorkers today.
