The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, in which he
requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of
the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with
the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the
Council, to invite that representative to participate in
the discussion without the right to vote, in conformity
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Atoki Ileka
(Democratic Republic of the Congo) took a seat
at the Council table.

The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

I should like to draw attention to the letter dated
23 October 2003 from the Secretary-General addressed
to the President of the Security Council (8/2003/1027),
which contains the text of the final report of the Panel
of Experts on the Illegal Exploitation of Natural
Resources and Other Forms of Wealth of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.

After consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council takes note of the
final report (S/2003/ 1027) of the Panel of Experts
on the Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources
and Other Forms of Wealth of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (the Panel), which concludes
its work, and emphasizes the connection, in the
context of the continuing conflict, between the

illegal exploitation of natural resources and
trafficking in raw materials and arms and the
strategies of the belligerents, which the Panel has
highlighted;

"Condemns the continuing illegal exploitation
of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, especially in the eastern part of the
country, recalls that it has always categorically
condemned these activities, which are one of the
main elements perpetuating the conflict, and
reaffirms the importance of stopping them by
exerting, if need be, the necessary pressure on the
armed groups, traffickers and all other actors
involved;

"Urges all States concerned, especially
those in the region, to take the appropriate steps
to end these illegal activities, by proceeding with
their own investigations, on the basis, in
particular, of information and documentation
accumulated by the Panel during its work and
forwarded to Governments, including through
judicial means where possible, and, if necessary,
to report to the Council;

"Reaffirms its determination to closely
monitor compliance with the arms embargo
imposed in resolution 1493 (2003) of 28 July
2003 and expresses its intention to address the
problem posed by the illicit flow of weapons into
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including
by considering the possible establishment of a
monitoring mechanism;

"Emphasizes that the prompt re-establishment,
by the Government of National Unity and
Transition, of State authority throughout the
territory, and the establishment of competent
administrations to protect and control exploitation
activities will constitute decisive elements for
ending the plundering of natural resources in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo;

"Encourages the Government of National
Unity and Transition to implement the resolutions
adopted in Sun City in April 2002 within the
framework of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue;

"Encourages States, trade-sector organizations
and specialized bodies to monitor the trade in raw
materials from the region in order to put an end to
the plundering of natural resources in the

Democratic Republic of the Congo, particularly
within the framework of the Kimberley process;

"Encourages States, the international
financial community and the international
organizations concerned to provide the aid needed
to the Government of National Unity and
Transition and to cooperate closely with it in
order to support the establishment of national
institutions capable of ensuring that the natural
resources are exploited transparently to
effectively benefit the Congolese people;

"Expresses the wish that convening at an
appropriate time an international conference on
peace, security, democracy and development in
the Great Lakes region of Africa will encourage
the promotion of regional cooperation to the
benefit of all States concerned;

"Expresses its intention to continue
following closely this situation in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2003/21.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 12.35 p.m.
