Ms. Almasabi: I would like to say two things. First of all, I am grateful to the speaker who said the Council could do more and do better. We are waiting for the Council. What is it going to do for us as people with disabilities? Actually, people with disabilities are waiting for me. Hundreds of messages are coming into my WhatsApp asking what is next for us. I am waiting for the Council to tell me what is next. In real life, how can it support, assist and help people with disabilities and present their rights, needs and realities in its work and budget? I would like to answer them. I am waiting for the Council. What is it going to do for us?
