Mr. Monteiro (Portugal): On this occasion of
profound grief for the Chinese people, Portugal sincerely
regrets the death of China's Paramount Leader, Mr. Deng
Xiaoping, a central and historic figure in the construction
of modern China.

Mr. Deng Xiaoping was instrumental in the deepening
of relations between China and Portugal. It was under his
able leadership that China and Portugal initiated the
ongoing negotiations for the hand-over of the administration
of the Territory of Macao in 1999. His constructive and
cooperative spirit is clearly reflected in the smooth progress
of those negotiations.

The President of the Republic of Portugal, who is
currently in China on a state visit, was able to express
personally to China and its people the heartfelt condolences
of Portugal and its people on the passing of Mr. Deng
Xiaoping.
