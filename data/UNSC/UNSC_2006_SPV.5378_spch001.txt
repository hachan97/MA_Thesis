The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

After consultations among the members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council reiterates its full
support for the International Working Group
(IWG) and endorses its fourth final communique.
It commends Prime Minister Charles Konan
Banny for his efforts to implement the road map
established by the IWG in accordance with
resolution 1633 (2005). The Security Council
reiterates its full support for him. It also
welcomes the cooperation between the Prime
Minister and the President.

"The Security Council also endorses the
arbitration by the High Representative for
Elections according to which the election of the
Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) Bureau
is in compliance with the Pretoria Agreement. It
urges the Ivorian parties to ensure the effective
functioning of the IEC as soon as possible.

"The Security Council also underscores the
imperative to guarantee the independence and
neutrality of Radio Television Ivoirienne (RTI).

"The Security Council urges the Ivorian
State authorities to facilitate, notably in the west,
the return of humanitarian agencies and
organization.

"The Security Council will review at the
beginning of March the progress made in the
implementation of resolution 1633 (2005) and the
decisions of the IWG. It will pay special attention
to the functioning of the IEC, to the steps taken in
order to guarantee unhindered and equitable
access to RTI, and to the launch of disarmament
operations and the identification process."

This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2006/9.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
