Mr. Shen Bo (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 2314
(2016). China's position on chemical weapons is clear
and consistent. We are strongly opposed to the use of
chemical weapons by any State, organization or person
in any circumstances.

China is deeply concerned about the use of
chemicals as weapons in Syria against the civilian
population and strongly condemns such use. China
consistently advocates for the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint
Investigative Mechanism to perform its functions in
line with its mandate and in an objective, impartial and
professional manner. We hope that the Joint Investigative
Mechanism, while respecting the sovereignty of the
countries concerned, will fully investigate and establish
the facts regarding the use of chemicals as weapons.

China hopes that the Security Council will remain
united on the question of chemical weapons in Syria and
speak with one, positive voice so as to play a positive
role in the final destruction of chemical weapons in
Syria and the maintenance of peace and security in
the country.

Political settlement is the only realistic way
to resolve the Syrian question. The international
community should adhere to the general direction of
political settlement and comprehensively promote
efforts on the four parallel tracks of ceasefire, peace
talks, humanitarian relief and joint forces to combat
terrorism. Through a Syrian-owned and led political
process, it should facilitate the conclusion of an
arrangement that addresses the interests of all parties
concerned so as to reach a comprehensive, long-term
and appropriate settlement of the Syrian question at an
early date.
