Mr. Motoc (Romania): My delegation voted
confidently in favour of the draft resolution in the
belief that, without interfering in any way with the
sovereign decision of Greek Cypriots and Turkish
Cypriots, we should do our best to support the complex
efforts that have been made for so many years under
the auspices of this Council to achieve a just settlement
of the Cyprus issue, allowing a reunited island to join
the European Union when it embarks on a historic
enlargement of which Romania, too, is a part.

We appreciate the huge good-faith contribution of
the parties and the Secretary-General's team to get the
process to this point. Now, the Cypriot people will have
to make their decision on the plan. Romania, for its
part, will continue to spare no effort in fostering the
aims that stand as the basis of this most difficult, but
generous political undertaking on Cyprus, which we
believe are shared by all members of the Council.
