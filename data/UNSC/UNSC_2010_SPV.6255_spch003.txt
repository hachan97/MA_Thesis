The President (spoke in Chinese): I thank the
Secretary-General for his statement.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Kai Eide. On behalf of the Council, I
would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Eide, who is
today making his last appearance before the Council in
his capacity as Special Representative of the Secretary-
General for Afghanistan. We have appreciated
Mr. Eide's capable leadership of the United Nations
Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and his unwavering
approach to this challenging work since he assumed the
post in March 2008. We wish him success in all of his
future endeavours. I now give the floor to Mr. Eide.
