The President (spoke in F rench): I would like to
inform the Council that there are 17 speakers
remaining on my list. I intend, with the cooperation of
the participants, to exhaust the entire list this
afternoon.

The next speaker is the representative of Nepal. I
invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to
make his statement.
