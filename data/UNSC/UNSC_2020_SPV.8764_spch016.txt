Mr. Heusgen (Germany): I fully support what my British and French colleagues have just said. Since your proposal, Mr. President, was to say that there must be a majority voting against, may I remind you of the year 2018. At the time, the Netherlands presidency wanted to invite Mr. Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights at that time, to brief the Council at a meeting on Syria (see S/PV.8209). At the time, our Netherlands colleagues were required to have nine votes in favour of that, and the provisional agenda did not receive the nine votes in favour. That was a case where the appointed High Commissioner for Human Rights in office was certainly able to brief the Council about the situation in Syria and the dire human rights situation, which had consequences for the political situation. The failure to allow such a briefing to take place was a scandal. Now you are trying to turn that around. I think we should proceed as in 2018.
