The President (interpretation from Spanish): I shall
now make a statement in my capacity as representative of
Honduras.

The delegation of Honduras views with concern the
latest developments in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It
believes that the taking of Srebrenica by the Bosnian Serb
forces is a totally unacceptable act that contravenes the
relevant United Nations resolutions of 1993, which
conferred on Srebrenica the status of safe area. My
delegation also deplores the fact that the Bosnian Serb
forces, in advancing on Srebrenica, carried out attacks on
UNPROFOR personnel and detained some of them.

These are deplorable events which deserve
condemnation by the international community. For this
reason, my delegation urges the Bosnian Serb forces to
respect the status of Srebrenica as a safe area in
accordance with the Agreement of 18 April 1993, to
cease their offensive actions against the safe areas
immediately, and immediately and unconditionally to
release the UNPROFOR personnel currently detained. My
delegation also appeals to the parties to do their utmost to
rectify the critical situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina by
means of a comprehensive and peaceful settlement, and
urges them to cooperate with the Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and
other humanitarian organizations in order to relieve the
suffering of the affected civilian population.

I now resume my function as President of the
Council.

There are no further speakers. The Security Council
has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration

of the item on its agenda.

The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 2.30 p.m.
