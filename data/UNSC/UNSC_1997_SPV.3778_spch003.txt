The President: I thank Mr. Akashi for his kind words
addressed to me.

The next speaker is Mr. Soren Jessen-Petersen,
Director of the New York Liaison Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), to
whom the Council has extended an invitation under rule 39
of its provisional rules of procedure. I invite him to take a
seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
