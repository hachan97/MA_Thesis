The President: The first speaker on my list is the
Minister for Foreign Affairs of South Africa,
Her Excellency Ms. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. I invite her
to take a seat at the Council table and to make her
statement.

I welcome the Minister as the representative of the
great nation of South Africa and thank her for participating
in today's important meeting. I know that Secretary of State
Albright deeply regrets that we were unable to hear Ms.
Dlamini-Zuma's statement before lunch.
