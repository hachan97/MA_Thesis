The President (interpretation from French): I thank
the Chairman of the Committee on the Exercise of the
Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People for the very
kind words he addressed to me.

The next speaker is His Excellency Mr. Engin
Ansay, Permanent Observer of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference, to whom the Council has extended an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure. I now invite him to take a seat at the Council
table and to make his statement.
