The President: I thank Mr. Gambari, Under-
Secretary-General and Special Adviser on Africa, for
those remarks.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The presidency, on its own responsibility, will
summarize important and new suggestions presented
during this debate and will circulate them shortly.

This is the last formal meeting of the Pakistan
presidency of the Security Council. Pakistan inherited
the presidency in good shape from Mexico. We are
concluding our presidency with a sense of deep
satisfaction. During this month, building on previous
efforts, we saw the Council regain its unity of purpose
and move forward in a constructive spirit.

I should like to take this opportunity to express
our gratitude and appreciation to all members of the
Security Council, who have extended unfailing
cooperation to the Pakistani presidency and have
enabled us to discharge our responsibilities this month.
I should also like to express my delegation's deepest
appreciation to the Security Council secretariat for its
invaluable and unstinting support. We are also grateful
to the support staff of translators, interpreters and
security personnel for their characteristic hard work
and good humour during the entire month. I wish to
conclude by wishing every success to my successor,
Ambassador Lavrov of the Russian Federation, into
whose expert and experienced hands the Council
presidency will pass next month.

The meeting rose at 6.05 pm.
