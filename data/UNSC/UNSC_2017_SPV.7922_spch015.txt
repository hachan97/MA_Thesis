Mr. Umarov (Kazakhstan): We are confident
that there is no solution to the question of Syria
besides a political one. We should all make every
possible effort to ensure that we reach it. My country
is deeply concerned about and strongly condemns
the use of chemical weapons, which occurred in
Idlib province earlier in April. All interested parties,
including the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic,
should ensure secure and unimpeded access for the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-
United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism so that
it can carry out its investigation in a professional,
objective and fair manner, as outlined in its mandate in
resolution 2235 (2015).

We strongly believe that the Security Council, as the
single organ entrusted with maintaining international
peace and security, should preserve its unity at such a
critical stage. Elected members of the Security Council
worked hard to find a middle ground and ensure a
united, efficient approach to the issue. We express our
readiness to work further with Council members on
the compromised text. The world does not want to see
tensions and ineffectiveness characterize the Council.
Rather, it wants to see a unified and tangible approach
to carry forward the Astana and Geneva processes, all
in the interest of the Syrian people.

Finally, we call on all parties to exert greater political
will and unite through dialogue and compromise in
order to find a political solution to the crisis in Syria.
