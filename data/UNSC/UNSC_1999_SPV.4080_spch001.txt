The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General on the situation concerning
Western Sahara, document S/ 1999/ 1219.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/ 1999/ 1239, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by France, the Russian Federation, the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and
the United States of America.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless
I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the
vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the voting.
