The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them letters
dated 15 April and 29 May 1998 from the Secretary-
General addressed to the President of the Security Council,
contained in documents 8/1998/330 and S/1998/446,
respectively.

Members of the Council also have before them
document 8/1998/537, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by Costa Rica, Japan, Portugal,
Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to document S/l998/531, which contains the
text of a letter dated 18 June 1998 from the Permanent
Representative of Iraq to the United Nations addressed to
the President of the Security Council.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless I hear any
objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the voting.
