Mr. Ryan (Ireland): I am pleased to inform
members that, following your suggestion this morning,
Sir, and as a result of further consultations, we appear
to have resolved some expressed concerns surrounding
the draft resolution.

The draft reflecting the agreement is before
members for their consideration. I might perhaps read
out the revised text of the new draft fourth preambular
paragraph, as agreed:

"Recognizing the importance attached, inter
alia, to the monitoring, for as long as is necessary,
of the implementation of the provisions contained
in resolutions 864 (1993), 1127 (1997) and 1173
(1998);"

I hope that members will now be able to agree on
this revised text.
