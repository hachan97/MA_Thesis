The President: I would like once again to thank
the three briefers and the representative of Nigeria for
their participation in today's meeting. And, of course, I
thank the members of the Council for their statements
and, more important, their engagement on this issue.

We have noted and welcomed the progress made
by the Governments in the region to push back Boko
Haram and improve humanitarian access. That progress
must be consolidated, sustained and supported. I heard
support around the table for a reinforced humanitarian
engagement, working with the Governments of the
region to meet the growing humanitarian needs there.
In that regard, the conference in Oslo in February will
be an important milestone. I also heard support for more
long-term and sustained engagement from development
partners in the region, which would include addressing
the root causes of the problems and the underlying
needs. Finally, there were calls for more regular and
sustained engagement on the issue on the part of the
Council, and it was proposed that the Council visit the
region. Let us make every effort to ensure that 2017
does indeed become a turning point for the people of
the region of the Lake Chad basin.

The meeting rose at 5.15 pm.
