Mr. Deinde-Fernandez (Central African Republic):
This being the first time that I have had the opportunity to
speak before the Security Council since you, Sir, assumed
the presidency of the Council, permit me to take this
opportunity to extend to you my Government's
congratulations, while at the same time expressing our
appreciation for the great task performed so well by your
predecessor.

Today is a great day for us in the Central African
Republic. We are very cognizant of the fact that the
Council has not approved any peacekeeping operation
anywhere in the continent of Africa for some time now.

My Government would like to express our deep
gratitude to the international community for this great
moment. We would like to thank the Secretary-General
and all those in the Secretariat whose effort made this
possible. We would like to thank the Council for its
indulgence, patience and tolerance in giving us the time
to accomplish all that was necessary to make this
possible. We would like to openly express our gratitude
to the French Government for its continued support, a
support that is most vital for the success of this operation.

I should like to reiterate my Government's
determination to cooperate fully with the United Nations
Mission in the Central African Republic (MINURCA) in
every way possible to ensure the success of its mission
and to fulfil all our commitments according to the letters
of my President to the Secretary-General and to the
Security Council and our obligations under the agreement
of MISAB. My Government is fully determined that
peace, once established, will be monitored and the process
of free and fair elections will be safeguarded.

Members of the Council, my Government thanks
you, my people thank you, and I thank you.
