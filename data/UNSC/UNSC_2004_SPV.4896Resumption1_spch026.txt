Mr. Abe: I shall be very brief. I wish to thank
delegations for the expressions of appreciation and
encouragement they have given to the work of the
Secretariat concerning small arms. The Secretariat will
continue working on the question of small arms on the
basis of the discussions held in the Council today. The
Secretariat will stand ready to assist any further work
of the Security Council concerning small arms and
light weapons. Finally, the Secretariat will be reporting
to the Council as appropriate.
