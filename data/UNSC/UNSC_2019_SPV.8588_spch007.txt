Ms. Norman-Chalet (United States of America):
My remarks will also be brief as we look forward to
discussing these issues in consultations. But I wanted
to thank Special Representative Salame for his briefing
to the Security Council today and for the serious and
pressing issues that he has raised. We continue to support
his leadership as he works to create the conditions for
a resumption of the United Nations political process.

As he highlighted, continued fighting in Tripoli,

now in its fourth month, is creating opportunities for
terrorists to regroup, threatening the stability of Libya's
oil production and fuelling a worsening humanitarian
situation. We have called for a ceasefire and urged for
the prompt return to a United Nations-mediated political
process, and we call on all sides to work constructively
with the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General and UNSMIL to achieve a long-overdue
political solution to the conflict. As we have said
repeatedly in this Chamber, lasting peace and stability
in Libya will come only through a political solution.

Finally, we want to express our once thanks once
again for the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General Salame', Deputy Special Representative
Williams, who is joining us in New York today, and the
entire UNSMIL and country team on the ground for
their work.
