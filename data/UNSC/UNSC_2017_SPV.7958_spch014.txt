Mr. Ciss (Senegal) (spoke in French): The
Senegalese delegation voted in favour of resolution
2356 (2017), which strengthens the sanctions regime
on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in
accordance with my country's commitment to a world
free of nuclear weapons, but also to express Senegal's
position in favour ofa denuclearized Korean peninsula.
North Korea's launches of ballistic missiles, which my
country has strongly condemned every time, attest to
the country's determination to continue its nuclear and
ballistic-missile programmes.

The previous sanctions have not stopped North
Korea from gradually upgrading its nuclear capabilities
and ballistic missiles. It continues to flagrantly violate
the Council's resolutions and repeated requests to
discharge its international obligations in this area in a
clear, irreversible and verifiable manner. The actions
of North Korea are therefore not only a threat to the
people inhabiting the peninsula and the region, but they
also seriously undermine the non-proliferation regime
with the goal of developing nuclear-weapon delivery
systems, which greatly exacerbates tensions in the
region and beyond.

I take this opportunity to reaffirm Senegal's
support for rigorous compliance with the relevant
Council resolutions and to reiterate our hope for
a swift resumption of dialogue in order to reach a
comprehensive, peaceful, diplomatic and political
solution to the crisis.
