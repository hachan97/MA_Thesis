The President: I shall now make a statement in
my capacity as representative of Uganda.

I wish to salute the Secretary-General for his
briefing and to thank the Permanent Representative of
Myanmar for his statement.

As the Government of Myanmar pursues its
seven-stage road map to democracy, stage five -
which relates to next year's elections - is important,
as the elections will contribute significantly to the
democratization process in the country. We urge the
Government of Myanmar to ensure that the electoral
process is free, fair, transparent and inclusive and that
all sectors of Myanmar society fully participate.

We call on the Government and on all parties to
pursue dialogue and reconciliation. In that regard, we
call for the unconditional release of all political
prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi.
