Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Unfortunately, a number of members of the
Security Council have not heeded our call to reject
any politicizing of this discussion of the humanitarian
situation in the eastern part of Ukraine on the provision
of humanitarian assistance to the population in need.
Someone, as always, has protected the Kyivan authorities
by distorting the role of the Russian Federation, others
have repeated speeches that they have given previously
in Security Council meetings, and some have said that
the killing and wounding ofindividuals as a result ofthe
armed conflict in Ukraine is not worthy of a separate
discussion.

Such propaganda was repeated by the representative
of Ukraine as well. We are grateful to those members
of the Council who shared our concern and our alarm.
We would like to once again reaffirm our readiness to
closely cooperate with the humanitarian agencies and
all relevant organizations and institutions that not only
can but must play their role in providing assistance and
help to the people of eastern Ukraine.

We cherish the hope that today's Council meeting
will serve to promote the coordination of our common
efforts with them.
