Mr. De Mistura: Based on your authorization and
your request, Madam President, I have no problem in
doing so. In fact, all of our proposals are, and should
be, public. I will gladly present that information. I only
ask to truly be given a chance to do so. I would not
like to miss the chance to actually make a proposal and
then see whether anyone else has other proposals. I will
be happy as long as we do not simply stop at saying
that this is a horrible thing and that we hope it does
not happen.
