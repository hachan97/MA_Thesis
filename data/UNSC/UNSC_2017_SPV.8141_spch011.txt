Mr. Vitrenko (Ukraine): As we see from the
report of the Secretary-General (S/2017/1057), as from
previous ones, the key negative trends that characterize
the Syrian humanitarian track continue. Despite the
appearance of active political engagement, we have
not seen any steady progress in the area of sustainable
humanitarian access.

The situation with respect to the delivery of
humanitarian aid remains basically the same as last
year. There are still nearly 420,000 people trying to
survive in conditions of total siege. That is unacceptable.
Eastern Ghouta stands out particularly, with drastic
food shortages and a lack of basic services. That area
accounts for nearly 96 per cent of all the besieged
population of Syria. There needs to be an immediate
lifting of all sieges. Humanitarian access should never
be employed as a war tactic.

Against that backdrop, the preservation of the
mechanism of cross-border humanitarian assistance
delivery is a matter of life and death for thousands of
Syrians. In fact, as has already been pointed out here,
the mechanism constitutes a vital humanitarian lifeline
for 3 million people in Syria. In such circumstances,
Ukraine strongly supported and wholeheartedly
welcomes the adoption of resolution 2393 (2017) by
the vast majority of Council members. It also highly
appreciates the efforts invested in that endeavour by
the humanitarian penholders. Our sincerest hope is
that the cross-border assistance will continue to make a
life-saving difference on the ground.
