Mr. Kuzmin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I would just like to explain that the item
on our agenda, "The situation in the Middle East",
is an existing agenda item and that of course we are
not against it per se. What we are against is holding
today's meeting in the format that has been proposed.
Therefore, I would ask the President to formulate the
question to reflect the fact this is a procedural vote.
