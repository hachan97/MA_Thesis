Mr. Skracie (Croatia): My delegation would like
to join other delegations that have expressed their
grave concerns about the latest developments in
Georgia, especially with regard to the current
heightened tensions and the reported fighting and
exchange of heavy fire between Georgian armed forces
and the forces of the Georgian region of South Ossetia
near the area of Tskhinvali. We note that a number of
casualties have been reported on both sides. In that
regard, we welcome the call of Georgian President
Saakashvili for the bloodshed to end.

Croatia believes that the sides should promptly
invest credible efforts to reduce tensions, including
with an immediate ceasefire, so as to remove the
danger of further escalation. Croatia urges all sides to
refrain from any further acts of provocation and would
welcome an immediate resumption of negotiations. My
delegation is also concerned by reports of volunteers
coming from other conflict areas of Georgia, which
could have a destabilizing effect and could signal the
widening of the conflict.

Croatia would like to take this opportunity to
reiterate once again its support for the sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity of Georgia,
which were affirmed in the relevant Security Council
resolutions, including resolution 1808 (2008).

Finally, Croatia takes note of President
Saakashvili's repeated offer, contained in his letter of
7August 2008 circulated to the Security Council, in
support of his peace plan from three years ago that
contains almost unrestricted autonomy and local
governance for the region of South Ossetia, and would
welcome a return to peaceful negotiations within that
framework.
