Mr. Li Baodong (China) (spoke in Chinese):
Over the past few days, China has repeatedly
emphasized that, in addressing the Libyan issue, we
must adhere to the following four principles.

First, stability and order should be restored to the
country as soon as possible, in the interests of Libya
and the international community. Secondly, the
aspirations and choices of the Libyan people must be
respected. Libya's sovereignty, independence, unity
and territorial integrity must be genuinely respected.
The future and national affairs of the country should be
decided by the Libyans themselves. Thirdly, an
inclusive political process should be launched as soon
as possible. National reconciliation should be
promoted, enabling Libya to embark swiftly on the
path of national reconciliation and development.
Fourthly, in assisting Libya in its reconstruction, the
United Nations and the Security Council should play a
leading role in accordance with the purposes and
principles of the United Nations Charter.

On the basis of these four principles, China voted
in favour of resolution 2009 (2011), just adopted.
China will continue to support the Libyan people in
their efforts to safeguard national sovereignty, rebuild
their country and pursue development.
