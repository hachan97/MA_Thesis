The President (spoke in French): It is now
12.30 pm. and I have 10 speakers still inscribed on my
list. I intend to continue with the debate until we have
heard all speakers. I ask the remaining speakers to
make their remarks as succinct as possible.

I now give the floor to the representative of Costa
Rica.
