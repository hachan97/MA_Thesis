Mr. Llorentty Soliz (Plurinational State ofBolivia) (spoke in Spanish): I would like to begin by wishing
you, Sir, and your team every success in presiding over
the work of the Security Council during the month of
February. I would also like to echo your comments, Sir,
and of those who spoke before me, in congratulating
the Swedish presidency on its work during the month
of January.

The Plurinational State of Bolivia recognizes
and encourages the brave and determined work being
carried out by the Iraqi people and Government in the
fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Sham
and terrorism and underscores that the provision of
humanitarian assistance that the Iraqi Government
has ensured in all its military tasks is in accordance
with international humanitarian law. At the same
time, Bolivia reiterates its vigorous condemnation
of the terrorism and violence that have been wrought
upon women and children in Mosul. Similarly, the
Plurinational State of Bolivia recognizes the efforts
and will of the Iraqi people to reach a historic political
and social agreement by consensus and with mutual
respect among all parties involved that establishes and
strengthens peace, in accordance with respect for the
principles of sovereignty, independence and territorial
integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of
States.

We add our voice to the calls for support for the
rebuilding of hospitals, schools and State universities
destroyed during the conflict, as well as for the
requests for support to carry out electoral processes
in various regional Governments, in particular with
regard to the biometric voter registry. We believe that
the international community must recognize the efforts
carried out by the Iraqi Government and, in particular
the Iraqi people, in the common struggle against
terrorism.
