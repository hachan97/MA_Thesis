Mr. Rosselli (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish):
Uruguay voted in favour of resolution 2375 (2017) and
welcomes its unanimous adoption. In the 21 months
that we have been a member of the Security Council,
this is the fifth resolution we have adopted to impose
sanctions on North Korea. This is also the fifth time that
my delegation has stressed that the Security Council's
action and the unity of its members are crucial in order
to counter the grave threat to international peace and
security posed by the repeated violations by North
Korea of the Council's resolutions. As well, this is the
fifth time that my country maintains that nuclear tests
and ballistic missile launches exacerbate instability
on the Korean peninsula and tension in the region and
constitute ongoing provocations of the international
community. And, too, this is the fifth time that Uruguay
reiterates the urgent need that the Government of North
Korea respect the resolutions of the Security Council
and halt its nuclear and ballistic missiles programmes.
Uruguay once again urges that country, for the fifth
time, to wholly, verifiably and irreversibly abandon
its nuclear programme and immediately end all related
activities, including launches involving ballistic missile
technology, and other provocative acts.

Sanctions are simply a means of bringing the
Government of North Korea to the negotiating table.
It is necessary to work towards a sustainable, results-
focused dialogue as soon as possible. Resolving the
North Korean conflict will be made possible only
through dialogue and diplomacy and within the
framework of an international strategy that includes
a firm commitment by all countries to ensure the
appropriate and effective implementation of the
sanctions put in place by the Security Council.

Lastly, and again for the fifth time, we reaffirm our
unwavering commitment to continue working towards
a peaceful, diplomatic and political solution in order to
denuclearize the Korean peninsula.
