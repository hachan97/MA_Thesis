Mr. Alyas (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): I find
it strange that as we meet today to discuss the issue of
the Middle East and the question of Palestine, and the
representative of Israel has openly attacked countries
that have stood on the side of right and against his
country's aggressions, the delegation of Israel has
raised domestic issues that are none of its concern. That
is hardly surprising, considering that Israel is known
to misrepresent the truth and to violate the rights of
the Palestinian people and international law on a daily
basis.

I congratulate the representative of Israel for
returning, towards the end of his statement, to the topic
under discussion today. Unfortunately, he also mocked
those present here by claiming that Israel is committed
to the peace process.
