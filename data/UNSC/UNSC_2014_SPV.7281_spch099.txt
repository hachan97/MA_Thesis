The President (spoke in Spanish): The representative
of Israel has asked for the floor to make a further
statement. I would never stand in opposition to
constructive dialogue, for which reason I shall give him
the floor. Following his additional statement - he does
have the right - I think we will be able to conclude
the meeting. Again, as President of the Council and
in my national capacity, we can never, in any way, cut
off constructive statements. That is what I ask of his
statement.

I give the floor to the representative of Israel.
