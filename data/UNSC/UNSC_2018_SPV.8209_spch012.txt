Mr. Kuzmin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We propose voting on whether the meeting
should be held today or not. Obviously, we assume that
the issue that should be put to the vote is whether today's
meeting should be held in principle. We have not yet
adopted the agenda for today's meeting. If we had, the
meeting would take place. But that has not happened.
