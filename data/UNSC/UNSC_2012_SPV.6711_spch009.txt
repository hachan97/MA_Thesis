Mr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish):
Our position on the situation in Syria was fully
7

explained by our Minister for Foreign Affairs last
Tuesday in the Chamber (see S/PV.6710).

Our prime objective is to help to put an end to the
spiral of violence afflicting the Syrian population and
to find a political solution to the crisis experienced by
that country. We believe that the League of Arab States
has adopted an initiative that meets both goals (see S/2012/71, annex). We therefore voted in favour of the
draft resolution just put before us (S/2012/77).

We regret that our vote was in vain owing to the
very particular voting system that governs our
decision-making process. That adds to the ranks of
those affected by this matter - not only the victims of
the violence, whom, I underscore, are our prime
concern, but also the effectiveness of the Security
Council in adequately responding to the challenges
facing it.

In conclusion, our delegation deeply regrets that
we have failed to meet the request made of us by the
League of Arab States. We urge its member countries
to persevere in its initiatives, including that of
22 January.
