Mr. Allen (United Kingdom): Let me say simply
that we very much welcome the Council's decision to
renew the authorization for Member States and regional
organizations to inspect and seize vessels involved
in people smuggling and human trafficking off the
coast of Libya. We remain deeply concerned about the
ongoing conflict in Libya and the impact it is having on
civilians, including vulnerable migrants, refugees and
internally displaced people. The Council condemns all
acts of migrant smuggling and human trafficking in
Libya and off the coast of Libya.

The United Kingdom is clear that there can be
no military solution in Libya. The only way to bring
stability to the country is through a ceasefire and a
negotiated political settlement. We remain steadfast in
our support for Special Representative Ghassan Salame
and his leadership of the political process.
