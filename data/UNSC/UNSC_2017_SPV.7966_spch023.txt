Mr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): I will be very brief. He
who lives in a glass house should not throw stones. It is
appalling that the Russian Federation, which supplies
separatists in the Donbas with all kinds of ordnance,
ammunition and mines, has the nerve to lecture about
mine awareness and demining.

The meeting rose at noon.
