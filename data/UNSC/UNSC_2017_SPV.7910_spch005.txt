Mr. Bessho (Japan): At the outset, let me join
previous speakers in expressing condolences to the
families of the two brave and dedicated members of
the Group of Experts - Michael Sharp and Zaida
Catalan - killed in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo. The parties responsible for their deaths must be
held accountable.

Japan welcomes the unanimous adoption of
resolution 2348 (2017). I would like to thank France for
taking the lead in preparing the resolution. Japanese is
pleased to have co-sponsored it. Our common goal is
to stabilize the situation in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo and achieve a progressive exit of the United
Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO). Let
me underscore two points in that regard.

First, through this resolution the security Council
reaffirms its strong support for the implementation of
the 31st December 2016 political agreement, mediated
by by the Conference episcopale nationale du Congo.
Japan calls on President Kabila and all Congolese
political actors to swiftly implement the agreement
and accelerate preparations for elections, to be held
by the end of this year. That is the only viable way
to consolidate and sustain peace and stability in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Secondly, Japan values the fact that the Security
Council has reaffirmed its commitment to making
the Mission more efficient by authorizing a clearer
and more prioritized mandate for MONUSCO in line
with the Secretary-General's efforts. Japan reaffirms
its full support for MONUSCO and for the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Maman
Sidikou.
