Mr. Tanin (Afghanistan): I want to sincerely
thank everyone who has spoken today for their support
for Afghanistan, the Afghan people and the
stabilization process. I have taken note of all the views,
suggestions and concerns that have been presented
today. The enduring partnership between the
international community and Afghanistan is key to
success in the country.

I am particularly grateful to you, Sir, for
organizing this debate on your last day as President of
the Council and at the United Nations. You have been a
well-known and well-respected diplomat at the United
Nations, and particularly in our region for your work
there earlier in your career. In Afghanistan, you are
known to be a distinguished diplomat of a country,
Turkey, that has cordial relations with mine. In the
name of the Afghan people, I would like to pay tribute
to your work and your efforts on behalf of Afghanistan.
We take note and will certainly remember that the
convening of this debate was among your last official
acts.
