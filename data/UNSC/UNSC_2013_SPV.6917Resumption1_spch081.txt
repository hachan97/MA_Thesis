The President: The time is now nine minutes past
eight and we have about 15 more speakers. I would
therefore like once again to request that all speakers
limit their statements to no more than four minutes.
Delegations with longer statements are kindly requested
to circulate their texts in writing and to deliver a
condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.

I now give the floor to the Permanent Representative
of Benin.
