Ms. Lee (Singapore): I, too, would like to thank
Deputy President Zuma for his very interesting and
useful briefing today. We were already viewing the 2
December agreement as a significant step forward, and
Deputy President Zuma's detailed briefing has
confirmed our optimism about the developments of the
situation in Burundi.

I have just one question to ask, and it is very
similar to the question already asked by the
representative of China. I wanted to ask what more the
Security Council could do to help; that just goes to
show that Security Council members are of a similar
mind with regard to our commitment to try to do our
best to help Burundi. I will still ask my question,
because it is focused on the issue of the transfer of the
presidency, which is less than six months away. Deputy
President Zuma mentioned that the United Nations, and
in particular the Security Council, needs to continue to
play a role in Burundi. I would like to ask whether he
has any specific suggestions about how the Security
Council can help to bring about the transfer
successfully and on schedule.
