The President: Mr. Minister, thank you for your
participation, in fulfilment of a pledge your President
made when I visited him last month in Bamako. We are
delighted that you have joined us today. I thank you also
for your very important remarks and for your leadership
role in these problems.

It is now my very great honour to welcome and call
on the Foreign Minister of Canada, The Honourable
Lloyd Axworthy. We are delighted that he has made the
long, difficult trip from Canada to New York.
