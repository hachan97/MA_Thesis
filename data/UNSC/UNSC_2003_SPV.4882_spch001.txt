1265 (1999) of 17 September 1999 and 1296
(2000) of 19 April 2000 on the protection of
civilians in armed conflict, as well as the
statements by its President of 12 February 1999
(S/PRST/1999/6), of 15 March 2002

the protection of civilians in armed conflict as an
important item on the Council's agenda.

concern at the suffering inflicted upon, and
hardships borne by, civilians during armed
conflict, and recognizes the consequent impact
that this has on durable peace, reconciliation and
development. The Security Council strongly

against civilians or other protected persons under
international law, in particular international
humanitarian law in situations of armed conflict,
including such attacks and acts of Violence
against women, children, refugees, internally
displaced persons and other vulnerable groups;
reaffirms the need for parties to armed conflict to
take all possible measures to ensure the safety,
security and freedom of movement of United
Nations and associated personnel as well as
personnel of international humanitarian
organizations in accordance with applicable
international law; and recognizes that secure
humanitarian access and the swift re-
establishment of the rule of law, justice and
reconciliation are essential components for an
effective transition from conflict to peace. The

Security Council reiterates its call to all parties to
armed conflict to comply fully with the
provisions of the Charter of the United Nations
and with the rules and principles of international
law, in particular international humanitarian,
human rights and refugee law, and to implement
fully the relevant decisions of the Security
Council. The Security Council recalls the
obligations of States to respect and to ensure
respect for international humanitarian law,
including the four Geneva conventions, and
emphasizes the responsibility of States to end
impunity and to prosecute those responsible for
genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity
and serious Violations of humanitarian law. The
Security Council also notes with interest the
proposal presented by the Under-Secretary-
General for Humanitarian Affairs at the 9
December open meeting of the Security Council
for a '10-point action plan' on the protection of
civilians in armed conflict, and looks forward to
further discussions and consultations on this
issue.

"Recalling that on 15 March 2002 the
Security Council adopted the Aide Memoire
annexed to the statement by its President
(S/PRST/2002/6) as a means to facilitate its
consideration of issues pertaining to protection of
civilians, and recalling further that in the
statement by its President of 20 December 2002
(S/PRST/2002/41) the Security Council expressed
its willingness to update annually the Aide
Memoire in order to reflect emerging trends in
the protection of civilians in armed conflict, the
Security Council adopts the updated Aide
Memoire contained in the annex to this
presidential statement. The Security Council
reiterates the importance of the Aide Memoire as
a practical tool that provides a basis for improved
analysis and diagnosis of key protection issues
during deliberations on peacekeeping mandates,
and stresses the need to implement the
approaches set out therein on a more regular and
consistent basis, taking into account the particular
circumstances of each conflict situation, and
undertakes to remain actively seized of the
