The President: As I said at the outset, the Council
is meeting today in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations, which, as the Permanent
Representative of Burundi was generous enough to point
out earlier on, included consultations with him. I think
that at this stage the Council is fully conversant with the
view on this matter expressed again today by the
Permanent Representative of Burundi. In the light of that,
it is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is do decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements before the voting.
