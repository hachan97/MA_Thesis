Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I apologize for taking
the floor again, but I cannot allow those allegations
against the Bank of England to go unaddressed.

I reject completely the allegations made by the
Venezuelan Ambassador. He has made them before. I
wrote to the then President ofthe Security Council - the
Permanent Representative of Equatorial Guinea - on
21 February, rejecting the allegations (S/2019/176). I
will have that letter circulated again and we will put
it on our website. But for the benefit of the record,
the Bank of England's reputation is world-renowned.
It operates to the highest standards. It has operational
independence from the British Government.
