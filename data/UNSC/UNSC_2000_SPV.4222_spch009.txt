Mr. Angel] (Canada): I wish to thank Under-
Secretary-General Guehenno for his very thorough
briefing.

We join other members of the Council in
expressing our pleasure at the positive showing of the
non-nationalist, multi-ethnic Social Democratic Party
(SDP), which received the greatest support within the
Federation. We are concerned, however, at the
continuing strength of the nationalist parties of each
community and at the effect that this continuing
strength may have on the implementation ofthe Dayton
Peace Agreement.

I have two questions for Mr. Guehenno, and
recognize that it may not yet be possible to answer
either of them. First, we listened very carefully to Mr.
Guehenno's comments about Mr. Jelovie and are
wondering whether Mr. Guehenno has a sense of
whether the international community present in Bosnia
and Herzegovina, including the United Nations
Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, will respond in
any way to the extreme views that were expressed by
Mr. Jelovie. Secondly, we would ask whether Mr.
Guehenno has any more detailed sense of the likely
timing ofthe presidential elections.
