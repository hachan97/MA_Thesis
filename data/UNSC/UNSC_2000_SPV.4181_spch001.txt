The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on Ethiopia and Eritrea,
document S/2000/643.

Members of the Council also have before them

18 July 2000, respectively, from Ethiopia.

It is my understanding that the Security Council
