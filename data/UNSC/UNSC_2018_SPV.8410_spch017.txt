The President (spoke in Chinese): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of China.

First of all, I would like to thank Under-Secretary-
General for Political Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo for
her briefing.

China has noted the altercations between Russian
and Ukrainian naval ships in the waters near the Kerch
Strait. We are concerned over the tensions arising
therefrom. China calls for the relevantparties to exercise
restraint, and hopes that they will, in order to prevent
any further escalation of tension and properly resolve
the relevant issues through dialogue and concertation.
China has consistently maintained its objectivity and
impartiality with regard to the crisis in Ukraine. China
respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all
countries, including Ukraine, and opposes interference
in Ukraine's internal affairs by any external forces.
We are always of the view that military solutions will
get nowhere. The only way to resolve crises is through
dialogue and negotiations.

The international community must stay the course
with its diplomatic efforts to push for a political
settlement of the Ukrainian crisis. Discussions in the
Council should contribute to achieving a genuine easing
of tensions in the affected regions of Ukraine and play
a constructive role in facilitating a political solution.
China believes that all the relevant parties should
earnestly implement the new Minsk agreements and
stay the course of political settlement through dialogue
and concertation in seeking a comprehensive solution
to the Ukrainian issue. That will enable Ukraine to
achieve peace, stability and development, enabling
all ethnic groups to live in peace within Ukraine, and
Ukraine to live in peace with all the countries of the
region. China is ready to continue playing its positive
role in the political settlement of the crisis.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Ukraine.
