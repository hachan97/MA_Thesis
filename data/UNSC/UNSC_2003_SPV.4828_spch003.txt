Mr. Tafrov (Bulgaria) (spoke in French):
Bulgaria abstained in the voting on the draft resolution,
as it does whenever there is no unanimity on the
Council or, worse yet - like today, regrettably - there
is an impasse.

Given the extremely grave situation in the Middle
East, the Council should have made an extra effort to
find consensus. Bulgaria appeals yet again to the
Palestinian Authority to do all it is called upon to do in
the Quartet's road map in order to stop the suicide
attacks and all acts of terrorism against Israeli
civilians. We also call on the Government of Israel to
halt the extrajudicial killings and to renounce its
intention to expel President Yasser Arafat, as called for
by the Quartet's road map.
