The Secretary-General: Thank you very much,
Mr. President, for those kind words. I am honoured to
be here, and I thank the President of the Security
Council, His Excellency Ambassador Churkin, for this
opportunity to meet with the members of the Council
in this historic Chamber.

As this is my first meeting with you, let me pay
tribute to all Council members and extend, in this new
year, my best wishes to all of you for a most successful
2007. In particular, let me acknowledge the presence of
the new members, namely, Belgium, Indonesia, Italy,
Panama and South Africa, which joined the Council at
the same time as I joined the Organization. We have
much to learn together.

Allow me to assure all of you of my deep sense
of mission, duty and dedication as I assume this high
office. You know, perhaps better than anyone else, that
I do so at a daunting time in world affairs. The
international community faces a range of challenges,
from Darfur to the Middle East, and other crises that
trouble our world, from defending human rights to the
need to move forward in achieving the Millennium
Development Goals.

I look forward to working closely with the
Security Council to ensure that the Organization lives
up to the considerable expectations that the
international community places on us. As the Council
considers the perspectives of the Member States on
threats to international peace and security, I am here to
listen to all of you.
