Mr. Laro (Nigeria): I also thank Under-Secretary-
General Feltman for his briefing.

Since the Council's meeting last week on the
situation in Ukraine (see S/PV.7365), the conflict in the
country has intensified, and civilians continue to suffer
the consequences. The rocket attacks on Mariupol,
which left 30 people dead and more than 100 injured,
including women and children, serve to illustrate
this point. Nigeria condemns in the strongest terms
indiscriminate attacks on residential areas. They serve
no military purpose, they violate international law and
they are unacceptable.

We call on both sides to immediately de-escalate
the fighting and respect the terms of the ceasefire
agreement reached at the Minsk peace talks. We stress
that there can be no military solution to the conflict
in Ukraine. The parties should seek a political solution
through dialogue. It is important that the concerns of
the separatists be addressed within the framework of
a negotiated political settlement. That should be done
without compromising the sovereignty, independence
and territorial integrity of Ukraine.
