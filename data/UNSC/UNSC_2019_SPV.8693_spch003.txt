Mr. Djani (Indonesia): Indonesia welcomes
the unanimous adoption of resolution 2503 (2019),
which renews the mandate of the United Nations
Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) for a
period of six months. We thank the co-penholders for
their positive role in facilitating the discussion on the
resolution and constructively addressing the proposals
of Security Council members, including those
of Indonesia.

My delegation wishes to highlight the importance
of the safety and security of UNDOF peacekeepers.
UNDOF remains an impartial entity. It is important
for all parties to halt all activities that endanger United
Nations peacekeepers on the ground and to accord
United Nations personnel the freedom to carry out their
mandates safely and securely.

We strongly support UNDOF's liaison functions
with the parties concerned, in particular its key role
in preventing any escalation of the situation across the
ceasefire line. We urge all the relevant parties to fully
respect the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement
and exercise maximum restraint.
In conclusion, my delegation would like once
again to put on the record that Indonesia recognizes
the Golan - occupied by Israel since 1967 - as an
inalienable part of the territory of the Syrian Arab
Republic, and strongly rejects the recognition of the
Golan Heights as part of Israel. This position is in
accordance with the principles of sovereignty and
territorial integrity as enshrined in the Charter of the
United Nations, as well as the relevant Security Council
resolutions. We urge all parties to maintain their
commitment in respecting international law and the
Charter and to work together to create an environment
conducive for the ongoing peace process in the region.
