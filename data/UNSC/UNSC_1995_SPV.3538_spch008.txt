Mr. Fulci (Italy): Together with the other European
Union countries present on the Council, Italy has proposed
some amendments to the original text of the draft resolution
in order to achieve a more balanced resolution that we think
will not hinder, but rather, stimulate progress in the peace
process in the Middle East, one of the most important
acquis which must absolutely be preserved.

The amendments proposed by the European countries
were incorporated into the text, and Italy therefore will vote
in favour of the draft resolution.

In this respect, I should like to reiterate the
principles emphasized in the statement made by the
Representative of France on behalf of the European Union
during the formal meeting of the Security Council last
Friday - in particular, that the expropriation of land in
East Jerusalem is contrary to the spirit of the Declaration
of Principles as well as to international law and the
relevant resolutions of the Security Council. We sincerely
hope, therefore, that the orders will be rescinded. In our
opinion, the spirit of the Declaration of Principles with
regard to Jerusalem is to keep the city in its present state
until the end of the negotiations. Italy hopes that the
intention of the Israeli Government not to carry out any
additional expropriation of land in Jerusalem for housing
purposes will be equally and concretely pursued as a real
step on the road to significant progress in the peace
process, which the European Union is following with the
utmost attention and supporting with substantial financial
resources.

We should also like to appeal to the Palestinians to
continue in their ongoing commitment to peace, also
taking into account the results of the Security Council's
formal meeting on this issue that ended yesterday. Indeed,
the international community has made clear yet one more
time its willingness to support the peace process along the
lines of the Declaration of Principles, in the interests of
the Israeli and the Palestinian peoples, of stability in the
Middle East region, and of peace in the world.
