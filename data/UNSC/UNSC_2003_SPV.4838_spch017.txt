Mr. Mahmood (Pakistan): We too are grateful for
the comprehensive briefings of the Presidents and
Prosecutors of the International Criminal Tribunal for
the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). Pakistan fully
supports the work of the two Tribunals and attaches
great importance to the timely realization of their
respective completion strategies.

We have noted the statement about the level of
cooperation afforded to the ICTY in certain instances.
We cannot express enough how important it is for the
Tribunal to have full cooperation from all concerned in
the prosecution and ultimate conviction of the
perpetrators of some of the worst war crimes
committed in recent memory.

Through resolution 1503 (2003), the Security
Council called on States to cooperate with the two
Tribunals. We believe the Council must send a signal
that it remains serious about ending impunity for war
crimes, and that it will be watching closely as the
Tribunals proceed further with their work, which has
important applications for justice and the rule of law
and respect for international humanitarian law.

To conclude with a question, we would like to ask
what additional steps can be taken to elicit greater
cooperation for the prosecutorial work of the two
Tribunals.
