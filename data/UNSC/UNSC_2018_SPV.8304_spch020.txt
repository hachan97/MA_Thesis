Mr. Zouev (spoke in Spanish): We have taken
detailed notes on the important comments and
recommendations that Council members have made
today, and we will be implementing them in our mine
action efforts in future. We will also definitely take
note of the President's recommendation to use more of
the official languages of the United Nations, and more
than the three that I have used in my briefing today.
In that regard I would like to point out that last June,
during Bolivia's presidency, when I had the honour of
representing the Secretary-General at the meeting (see S/PV.7992) at which the Council adopted its historic
resolution 2365 (2017), I used four of the official
languages, including Spanish, which, unfortunately, is
not my best.
