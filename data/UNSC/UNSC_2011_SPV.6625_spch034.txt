Mr. De Mistura: If Minister Rassoul will allow
me, I will say that both Afghanistan and the United
Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA)
feel highly hopeful, from what I have been hearing in
this meeting. This body is providing support for the
future of Afghanistan - in spite of the tragic events
that have occurred - and for the work of UNAMA, as
well as for continuing cooperation between the Mission
and the country. That support is going to help both of
us when we return to Kabul, as I will tomorrow. That
would be my only comment.

I would like to say a word about Lebanon, for
which I have great affection as I myself was posted
there. As have many other speakers, I wish to say how
pleased I am to see Lebanon holding the presidency of
this body.

Thank you, Mr. President. I wish you every success
and may God bless you and grant you health and
serenity.
