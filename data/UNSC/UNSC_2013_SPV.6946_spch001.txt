The President: I wish to warmly welcome the
Secretary-General and the representatives present in
the Chamber. Their participation is an affirmation of
the importance of the subject matter under discussion.

Under rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure, I invite His Excellency Mr. Tekeda Alemu,
Permanent Representative of Ethiopia to the United
Nations, representing the Chairperson of the African
Union, to participate in this meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of the members of the
Council to document S/2013/204, which contains a letter
dated 2 April 2013 from the Permanent Representative
of Rwanda to the United Nations addressed to the
Secretary-General transmitting a concept paper on the
item under consideration.

AS the President ofthe Security Council, I hope that
this important meeting on the item entitled "Prevention
of conflicts in Africa: addressing the root causes" will
be an occasion for the Council to revisit the concept and
practice of conflict prevention as currently understood
within the United Nations system. Recalling the
theme, today's briefing aims at examining how we can
move from a day-to-day management of conflicts and
develop a culture of conflict prevention through skills,
mechanisms and institutions that address the root
causes of conflicts in Africa.

The African Union has identified various factors
and root causes of conflict on the continent, and it has
established institutions and mechanisms to address
them. We believe that it is the right time for the Security
Council to strengthen its cooperation with the African
Union and its subregional organizations in order to
achieve better results in conflict prevention.
I now give the floor to the Secretary-General.
