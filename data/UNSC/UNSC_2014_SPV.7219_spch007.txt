Mr. Baublys (Lithuania): We are deeply shocked
by yesterday's downing of a Malaysia Airlines Boeing
777 in eastern Ukraine. We express our sincere
condolences to Malaysia, the Netherlands, Australia,
Indonesia, the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium,
the Philippines, Canada and the other nations whose
citizens were among the 298 people who perished. Our
deepest sympathies go to the families of the victims.

The circumstances ofthe downing mustbe established
by an independent, international investigaton, in
accordance with international civil aviation guidelines.
The perpetrators cannot escape responsibility.
Investigators must immediately be granted access to the
crash site and the black boxes must be handed over to
independent authorities in order to prevent the evidence
being tampered with.

The circumstances are impossible to ignore. They
all point in one direction, namely, that this horrible
crime was committed as part of the armed aggression
against Ukraine. The responsibility for that terror act
lies with those who are aggressively preventing Ukraine
from effectively exercising its sovereign rights over
its territory and airspace. It would not have happened
had Russia not armed and instigated the presence of
separatist groups in Donetsk and Luhansk provinces.
The international community cannot stand by in the
face of such aggression. The country has become a
threat to international peace and security. We have said
that all along since the occupation of Crimea.

The debris of the Malaysian plane lies in an area
controlled by pro-Russian separatists. This week alone,
a Ukrainian AN-26 cargo plane and an Su-25 fighter
jet were shot down by pro-Russian separatists from
a high altitude. The third - a Malaysian passenger
plane - was deliberately shot down. An Il-76 transport
plane and half a dozen helicopters were brought down
by pro-Russian separatists at Luhansk airport and
elsewhere. In June, separatists boasted of possessing
an SA-11 Buk missile system. They claimed to have
used the system to shoot down the An-26 cargo plane
at high altitude. Separatist commander Igor Strelkov
claimed to the media to have shot down another aircraft
at the same time as the Malaysian Airlines flight was
overflying the area.

We are truly shocked by the number of victims
among the civilian population in eastern Ukraine.
Armed separatists, terrorists and foreign fighters and
their supporters bear the responsibility for the deaths
and injuries among the civilian population, including
children, women and the elderly. The carnage must end.
President Poroshenko proposed a peace plan. Ukraine
declared a unilateral ceasefire. The agreement in Berlin
on 2 July provided a vehicle for talks. Yet separatists
and terrorists in the eastern part of Ukraine continued
to sow terror, loot, rob banks, racketeer, kidnap people
and traffic in human beings.

The massive and continuous influx of foreign
fighters from across the Russian border into the
neighbouring Luhansk and Donetsk regions has gone
unabated. That influx has been accompanied by T-65
tanks, Grad multiple rocket launchers, anti-aircraft
guns, towed anti-tank guns, BTR armoured personnel
carriers, man-portable air defence systems and small
arms. In fact, the terrorists in Donbas hardly bothered
to remove the markings of Russian military units from
their heavy weapons. Russian military helicopters and
drones violate Ukrainian airspace, while 40,000 troops
are encamped within minutes of the Ukrainian border,
in addition to the 20,000 troops stationed in occupied
Crimea. Russian citizens, many of whom are veterans
of the conflicts in Chechnya and Transdnistria, lead
many of the terrorist groups.

The Russian media channels are putting out
ongoing anti-Ukrainian propaganda. The mouthpiece of
the separatists, Life News, boasts of the agility of rebels
to shoot down any plane in sight. The terrorists and
separatists continue to take hostages. The abducted and
hooded Ukrainian pilot Nadia Savchenko was trafficked
by separatists from Ukraine straight to the Russian
Voronezh pretrial detention centre. We condemn the
unlawful detention of Ukrainian citizens in Russia.
Russia must respect the norms of international law and
release Savchenko immediately. We remain appalled by
the deteriorating human rights situation in Crimea.

Lithuania urges the holding of a full, thorough
and independent investigation into the downing of
the Malaysian Airlines flight, as agreed today by the
Council. Lithuania urges Russia to unequivocally
distance itself from any kind of direct or indirect
support for terrorists, separatists and foreign fighters.
The insurgents must lay down their weapons. Lithuania
calls on Russia to cooperate with Ukraine in order to
ensure the security of the borders and to prevent weapons
and armed terrorists from entering the territory of
Ukraine. We call on Russia to constructively cooperate
on the implementation of the peace plan put forward
by President Petro Poroshenko. A diplomatic solution
is possible. Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity within its internationally recognized
borders, including Crimea, are non-negotiable and must
be respected by all.
