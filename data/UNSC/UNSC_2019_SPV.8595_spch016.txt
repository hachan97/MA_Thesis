Mr. Talavera (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): We
appreciate the timely convening of this emergency
meeting and the informative briefing delivered by
Assistant Secretary-General Bintou Keita. Peru
categorically condemns the horrendous attacks that
occurred today in Benghazi. We join other delegations
in expressing our profound condolences over the
loss of civilian civilians and those of United Nations
staff members.

In that regard, we reaffirm our support to Special
Representative of the Secretary-General Salame' and
his entire team, who are working tirelessly in very
difficult conditions. As Ms. Keita said, the ongoing
conflict is leaving behind voids that are being filled
by unscrupulous terrorist groups, which spread only
death and destruction. Peru reiterates its support for the
three-point plan presented by Special Representative
Salame in July (see S/PV.8588). We hope that the
truce that was announced will be strictly upheld
by both parties and that it will be followed by high-
level meetings with the parties concerned, leading
to a Libyan-owned, Libyan-led and Libyan-owned
national dialogue. Peru urges the parties to return to the
negotiating table, with renewed mediation efforts, so as
to find a peaceful solution in an environment where a
military solution will lead only to more death.

Lastly, we urge countries able to influence the
parties to do so immediately and effectively to bring
them together and once and for all overcome all
economic and strategic considerations so as to allow
them to immediately ensure unconditional respect for
international humanitarian law and human rights
