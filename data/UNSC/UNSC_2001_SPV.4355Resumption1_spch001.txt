The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Thailand and Nigeria, in which
they request to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the discussion, without the right to
vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Singhara
Na Ayudhaya (Thailand) and Mr. Mbanefo
(Nigeria) took the seats reserved for them at the
side ofthe Council Chamber

The President (spoke in Spanish): I would also
like to ask representatives, as far as possible, given that
we have 25 speakers on the list, to ensure that speeches
are to the point.

The next speaker is the representative of Mexico.
I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to
make his statement.
