The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in the course of its prior consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to the following documents: S/ 1996/ 182, letter
dated 9 March 1996 from the Executive Chairman of the
Special Commission established by the Secretary-General
pursuant to paragraph 9 (b) (i) of Security Council
resolution 687 (1991) addressed to the President of the
Security Council; S/1996/183, letter dated 12 March 1996
from the President of the Security Council addressed to the
Executive Chairman of the Special Commission established
by the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 9 (b) (i) of
Security Council resolution 687 (1991); and S/1996/204,
letter dated 17 March 1996 from the Permanent
Representative of Iraq to the United Nations addressed to
the President of the Security Council, transmitting the text
of a letter dated the same date from the Deputy Prime
Minister of Iraq addressed to the President of the Security
Council.

Following consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council has noted with growing
concern that the incident described in the letter of 9
March 1996 from the Executive Chairman of the
Special Commission to the President of the Security
Council (S/ 1996/ 182) and the further incident on 11
March 1996 in which an inspection team was again
not allowed immediate and unconditional access to a
site designated by the Commission under its resolution
687 (1991) were followed by further such incidents on
14 and 15 March 1996. In all of these cases access
was subsequently granted only after unacceptable
delays.

"The Security Council reiterates its full support
for the Special Commission in the conduct of its
inspections and the other tasks entrusted to it by the
Council.
"The Security Council notes the letter of 17
March 1996 to its President from the Deputy Prime
Minister of Iraq (S/1996/204). It recalls that, under
paragraph 9 (b) (i) of section C of Security Council
resolution 687 (1991), Iraq is required to permit
'immediate on-site inspection of Iraq's biological,
chemical and missile capabilities, based on Iraq's
declarations and the designation of any additional
locations by the Special Commission itself'. By its
resolution 707 (1991), the Council also expressly
demanded that Iraq 'allow the Special Commission,
the International Atomic Energy Agency and their
inspection teams immediate, unconditional and
unrestricted access to any and all areas, facilities,
equipment, records and means of transportation
which they wish to inspect'. The obligation was
furthermore confirmed in the Commission's plan for
ongoing monitoring and verification which was
approved by the Security Council in resolution 715
(1991); in this context the Council recalls the notes
from the Secretary-General of 21 July 1993
(S/26127) and 1 December 1993 (S/26825).

"The Security Council considers that Iraq's
delays in permitting the inspection team recently in
Iraq access to the sites concerned constitute clear
violations by Iraq of the provisions of resolutions
687 (1991), 707 (1991) and 715 (1991). The Council
demands that the Government of Iraq allow the
Special Commission inspection teams immediate,
unconditional and unrestricted access to all sites
designated by the Commission for inspection in
accordance with the relevant resolutions of the
Council."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/1996/11.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 1.35 pm.
