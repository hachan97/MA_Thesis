The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
operation in Cyprus contained in document S/2004/756.
Members also have document 5/2004/829, which
contains the text of a draft resolution submitted by the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.

I should like to inform the Council that, in my
capacity as President of the Council, I met this
morning with the representatives of the parties, who
confirmed to me that maintain their well-known
positions vis-a-vis the item on the Council's agenda.
On the basis of those meetings, as President and with
the consent of the members of the Council, I draw the
conclusion that the Council can proceed to take a
decision on the draft resolution before it.

If I hear no objection, I shall now put the draft
resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by Show of hands.

In favour:
Algeria, Angola, Benin, Brazil, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Pakistan, Philippines, Romania,
Russian Federation, Spain, United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States
of America

The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1568 (2004).

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
