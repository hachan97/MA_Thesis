Mr. Jallow: I thank the members of the Council
for their supportive comments and suggestions.

I have some brief remarks to make in relation to
an issue raised by the Ambassador of the Republic of
Rwanda, which relates to the two cases that have been
referred to France by the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR).

Those are the only cases that the ICTR has so far
succeeded in referring to a national jurisdiction. I
simply wish to assure him that there are very effective
arrangements in place for monitoring the progress of
those two cases in France. My Office has retained the
services of two private law firms in France, whose
responsibility it is to undertake that task on our behalf.
They send regular reports to my Office, which we in
turn transmit to the Trial or the Referral Chamber for
their attention. The cases, after some preliminary work,
have been carried out by the French authorities
following the referral and are both now before an
investigating judge. The monitoring arrangements will
continue to provide us with the information as to their
status.

Allow me, if I may, to add, as the representative
of France indicated, that I was on mission in France
two months ago. One of the issues we discussed was
related to those two trials. I have received assurances
from various French authorities of their continued
commitment to managing those cases and ensuring that
they are dealt with expeditiously within the legal
system. So we do have effective arrangements in place
for monitoring and reporting on the status of the trials.
