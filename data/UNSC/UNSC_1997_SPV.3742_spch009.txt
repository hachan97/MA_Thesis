Mr. Ladsous (France) (interpretation from French):
We learned with great sorrow of the death of Mr. Deng
Xiaoping. He will remain in all of our memories as a
great figure in the history of China. I recall that France
welcomed him on its soil, along with other future leaders
of China, in the early 1920s. He will go down in history
as the major craftsman of the changes that the People's
Republic of China has experienced over the past 20 years.

I should like to convey our sincere condolences to
his famin and to the leadership of the People's Republic
of China, as well as to the Permanent Representative of
China to the United Nations.
