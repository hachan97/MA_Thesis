Mr. Delattre (France) (spoke in French): France
deeply regrets the inability of the Security Council to
adopt draft resolution S/2017/ 172 in spite of the support
of the majority of members. The draft resolution
was subject to far-reaching discussions in good faith
with our partners. Thanks to the Organization for
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations
Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), we had enough
information to take the necessary measures. We had
everything necessary to shoulder our responsibility,
to which we were unanimously committed. We are
therefore disappointed by the voting, of course, but
certainly not discouraged. We do not have the right to
be discouraged. We do not have the right to turn our
backs and give up. We do not have the right to resign
ourselves to the unthinkable - accepting the use of
weapons of mass destruction without reacting with the
necessary firmness.

That is why France, as underscored by Minister of
Foreign Affairs Jean-Marc Ayrault, will not give up.
The work of the JIM. will continue. Other cases will
be transferred to it and we will once again be required
to take a position. Sooner or later, the perpetrators
will be held to account. My country will remain fully
mobilized with its partners. France is therefore more
determined than ever to break the stalemate by drawing
upon all appropriate international institutions to ensure
these crimes are punished. I hope that when the time
comes we will be able to come together. Our most
fundamental values, as is our security and that of our
children, are at stake. And all these things are simply
far too important.
