Mr. Zhang Jun (China) (spoke in Chinese): In
my earlier remarks, I set out China's position on
draft resolution S/2019/961, concerning the Syrian
humanitarian issue. I would like to underscore that
China firmly rejects the groundless accusations
levelled against it by the United States of America and
other countries. As is well known, China has always
been constructive and responsible in dialogue and
consultations. We have been calling on the parties
concerned to take proactive steps to build consensus.
Our concerns are entirely justified and legitimate.
Like the positions of any other country, our position
is indisputable. Our independent voting decisions are
made on the basis of our principled positions and are
not subject to accusations by any party.

The current situation in Syria is exactly the result
of erroneous action by certain countries. Therefore, it
is they who really should be reflecting on their own
actions and who should be called on to answer all the
questions before us. If they are genuinely concerned
about the Syrian people amd the humanitarian situation
in Syria, why did they not vote in favour of the draft
resolution submitted by Russia? They have had every
opportunity to demonstrate and fulfil their commitment
to the Syrian people. That shows once again that they
are hypocritical in expressing their care or attention.
They are practicing typical double standards, which is
a concrete example of politicizing humanitarian issues.
