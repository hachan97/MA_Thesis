The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank
the representative of El Salvador for his kind words
addressed to me.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. If I

hear no objection I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
I shall first call on those members of the Council who
wish to make statements before the voting.
