The President (spoke in Spanish): We have heard
the last speaker in the debate. As President, having
convened this debate, I would like to express our
gratitude for the presence of so many countries making
so many statements. I am also grateful for the presence
of Mr. Mochochoko, representing the Prosecutor of
the International Criminal Court, and Judge Sang-
Hyun Song, President of the Court. We believe that our
expecations for this debate have indeed been fulfilled.
We hope that this will be the first step in an ongoing
examination of what is potentially an extremely rich
relationship between the Security Council and the
International Criminal Court.

The meeting rose at 6.35 pm.
