Mr. Al-Kidwa (Palestine) (spoke in Arabic): We
would like to reiterate our thanks to the members of the
Security Council for their prompt response to our
invitation and the invitation of the Arab Group to
consider the seriously deteriorating situation in the
occupied Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem.
We would also like to reiterate our thanks to the
Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his important
and useful contributions to the work of the Security
Council all day today. We would also like to express
our appreciation for the seriousness with which the
members of the Council considered the Arab draft that
was submitted to the Council during the consultations
on the various texts.

We believe that Council resolution 1402 (2002)
represents an important step that could make a positive
contribution to halting the deterioration of the situation
and bringing about the desired objectives, particularly
the Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian cities, including
Ramallah. We had hoped for a stronger text than the
one that has been adopted today. We had also hoped, of
course, that events would take a different course.
Nevertheless, the Palestinian side will abide by the
provisions of the resolution, and calls upon Israel to
declare a similar position, with a view to immediately
implementing the provisions of the resolution.
Regrettably, we have just listened to a negative
position, although it is not new on the part of Israel. It
is a position that constitutes a new challenge by the
forces of occupation to your Council. I am afraid this
position will impose on you additional measures if the
Council is to perform its duty in accordance with the
Charter of the United Nations. At this moment,
however, we will remain optimistic in the hope that the
serious deterioration will come to an end and that we
will truly see the implementation of the provisions of
this resolution.
