The President: I thank Ambassador Kumalo for
his very interesting and very crisp briefing. I think that
the political substance of what he has told us, as well
as what we have read in the press about how he was
received and the importance that the Timorese gave to
the mission, confirms how appropriate and wise was
the decision of the Council to send the mission to
Timor-Leste. I think it is also a lesson learned for the
future, when we will consider how to plan that sort of
mission. It will not be in a lS-member composition,
but I am convinced - of course, I am talking in my
national capacity - that more and more such missions,
which show the flag of the United Nations and that the
United Nations is near the countries involved, are
needed.

On behalf of all the Council, I should like to
express gratitude and very strong appreciation to all of
the members of the Security Council mission, so ably
led by Ambassador Kumalo, for the manner in which
they discharged their important responsibility on behalf
of the Council. I would also like to join my voice to
Ambassador Kumalo's in thanking the Secretariat for
all the invaluable assistance it has provided for the
success of the mission.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Timor-Leste.
