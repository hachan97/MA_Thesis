Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Pascoe
for his briefing.

The Libyan conflict has had a serious impact on
the political, security, economic and humanitarian
situation in the Sahel region. The large-scale return of
foreign nationals has created heavy economic and
social burdens for the countries in the region. The
proliferation of weapons has further encouraged cross-
border organized crime and terrorism in the region. The
negative impact of the Libyan situation will continue to
grow, posing a sustained threat to peace and stability in
the region. China expresses its grave concern in this
regard.

In order to eliminate those negative impacts, the
countries of the region have made positive efforts to
assist their own nationals to return and integrate into
local communities, and have worked to strengthen
border control and cooperation in justice and law
enforcement. The Economic Community of West
African States and other subregional organizations
have made full use of existing mechanisms in
coordinating the relevant efforts of the countries in the
region. Chine expresses its appreciation in this regard.

In the process of addressing the Libyan issue, the
concerns of Africans should receive due attention.
Africa's views should be duly respected. The negative
impact of the Libyan conflict should not be shouldered
by Africa alone. The international community should
provide active assistance to the countries and
organizations of the region, seriously consider and
effectively implement the relevant recommendations of
the report of the assessment mission (see S/2012/42),
and in that process enhance communication with the
countries and regional organizations. Relevant United
Nations agencies should give full play to their
respective expertise to gain more international support
for the region.
