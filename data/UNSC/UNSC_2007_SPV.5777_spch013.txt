Mr. Arias (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): At the
outset, allow me to thank Mr. Gambari for his work
during his most recent visit to Myanmar and above all
for the way in which he has performed his tasks.

Panama welcomes the presence at this meeting of
the representative of Myanmar and is pleased that we
also shall be hearing from the representative of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations. We would
have preferred, however, that both delegations had
made their statements prior to the members of the
Security Council.

Panama notes enthusiastically the successes
registered by Mr. Gambari during his most recent visit
to Myanmar. We also note in a particularly positive
vein the invitation extended to the Special Rapporteur
on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Mr.
Pinheiro, to visit that country. We trust that the Human
Rights Council will welcome his report upon his
return.

We also note with concern the lack of progress in
certain aspects of the Myanmar dialogue. In that
regard, we feel that the failure to free political
prisoners and the ongoing detainment of Aung San Suu
Kyi are serious obstacles in the way of political
progress in Myanmar.

Finally, we urge all nations -particularly those
that, because of their geographic or cultural links, are
closer and have better access to Myanmar - to leave
no stone unturned in their efforts to pursue a
satisfactory outcome in the political process under way.
It would be most unfortunate if the protection of
human rights in Myanmar, rather than move forward,
were to regress to its previous status.
