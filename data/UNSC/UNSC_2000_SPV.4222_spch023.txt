Mr. Guehenno: There were two questions from
the Canadian representative, one on President Jelovie's
remarks. It is, I think, the understanding of the
international organization present in Bosnia and
Herzegovina that those remarks should not go
unanswered. At the moment there is discussion with
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe on what the appropriate answer
is, and that has not been finalized yet.

On the second question, the timing of presidential
elections, this is indeed a very political issue, and we
do not have information at this stage as to when they
could take place.
