The President: I thank the representative of
Mozambique for the kind words he addressed to me.

Let me say, simply to draw it to everybody's attention,
that we have heard five speakers in the past 50 minutes,
which by my arithmetic averages out to 10 minutes per
speaker. At that pace we will not hear all speakers by the
time I intend to adjourn the meeting, at 5.30 pm.

The next speaker is the representative of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo. I invite him to take a
seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
