The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the
representative of Mexico for his kind words addressed
to me.

The next speaker is the representative of
Argentina. I invite him to take a seat at the Council
table.

Before giving the floor to the representative of
Argentina, I wish to express to the Mission of
Argentina the sorrow of the presidency concerning the
death a few days ago of Ana Maria Moglia, who was a
member of the Argentine delegation in the Council and
an outstanding colleague of many of those present here.
May our condolences be conveyed to her family in
Buenos Aires.

I now invite the representative of Argentina to
make his statement.
