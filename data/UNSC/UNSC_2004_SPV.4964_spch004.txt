Mr. Cunningham (United States of America): I
want to thank Mr. Passy for joining us today and for
giving us that overview of the activities of the
Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE). I want to commend him also for his effective
and active chairmanship of that important, if not
widely understood, organization, an organization that I
spent some part of my career working with.

I am glad to note in his statement the references
to strong United Nations-OSCE cooperation. We think
that is very important and welcome. In particular, of
the items that he raised, I think the OSCE conference
on anti-Semitism that was just held and the intention to
nominate a representative for trafficking in persons are
very welcome initiatives.

Mr. Passy spoke about developing an OSCE
border management and security strategy and about a
meeting that the OSCE is organizing in Vienna in
September on that subject. I understand that the United
Nations will be involved in the event as well, as will
other organizations. What sort of outcome is Mr. Passy
hoping for or anticipating from that session, and what
will future activities be?
