The President: As far as I know, this issue was
discussed by the political coordinators on the
understanding that, concerning the date in the draft
resolution, the language of paragraph 1 - "decides to
withdraw UNMIS effective 10 July 2011" - would be
replaced with "decides to withdraw UNMIS". I hope
that this will respond to the points raised by the
representative of the Russian Federation. I take it that
this is the case and we can now proceed to the vote on
the draft resolution before us.
