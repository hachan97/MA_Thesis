Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): I wish to
thank Mr. Ging of the Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs for his briefing.

Recently, the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine
has continued to escalate, causing increasing civilian
casualties and a dire humanitarian situation, which
continues to deteriorate. China is deeply worried about
the situation. We hope that the international community
will play a constructive role in easing the humanitarian
situation in eastern Ukraine and that United Nations
humanitarian agencies will strictly abide by the
principle of neutrality and objectivity.

We now face the urgent task of engaging in political
consultations with a view to achieving a ceasefire
as soon as possible and engaging in comprehensive
dialogue, which is the only way out of the Ukrainian
crisis. The parties concerned should remain calm and
maintain restraint, respect the Charter of the United
Nations, work on the basis of the various initiatives,
including the Geneva agreement, step up dialogue and
consultation, meet each other half way, respect the role
of current dialogue and liaison mechanisms and seek a
comprehensive settlement through peaceful means.

A political settlement to the Ukrainian crisis should
include the legitimate claims of various areas and
ethnic groups and realize a balance of interests. The
international community should do more to promote
peace and dialogue and should create favourable
conditions for the parties concerned to maintain
dialogue and engagement and make a constructive
effort to achieve political progress in the Ukrainian
cr1s1s.

China supports all efforts aimed at easing the
tension, resolving the crisis and achieving the proposed
political settlement, and will continue to play a
constructive role.
