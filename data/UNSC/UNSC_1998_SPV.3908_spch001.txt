The President (interpretation from Russian): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them document

1998 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President
of the Security Council regarding the nominations which
have been received for judges to the Trial Chambers of the
International Tribunal for Rwanda. In this connection, the
members of the Council will note the information
contained in the Secretary-General's letter and the
proposal which the Secretary-General makes therein that
the Council extend the deadline for nominations for
judges to the Trial Chambers of the International Tribunal
for Rwanda until 4 August 1998.

Members of the Council also have before them the
draft of a letter which I, as President of the Security
Council, would propose to send to the Secretary-General
in reply to the aforementioned letter. In the absence of
objection, I shall assume that the Security Council
endorses the proposal of the Secretary-General and agrees
that I should send the letter as drafted to the Secretary-
General.

It is so decided.

The reply will be issued as a document of the
Council under the symbol S/ 1998/646.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of the item on its agenda. The Council remains
seized of the item.
The meeting rose at 1.20 pm.
