The President: I should now like to put a question
to President Chiluba in my capacity as representative of
the Netherlands.

Some members of the Council have referred to the
distinction between the African and the non-African role.
It is clear that some tasks are better tackled by Africa
itself, whereas other duties may be in better hands with
outside actors. I should like to ask a question that
concerns this distinction.

Based on our experience with the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), we have somehow grown
accustomed to thinking in terms of African peacekeepers
partly financed by non-African donor countries. My
question is whether this is the only conceivable division
of work. If we look at the composition of the
multinational force which is now being prepared for duty
in East Timor, we see a rather different picture. The
emphasis there is on the region, to be sure, but the
multinational force for East Timor will, in the end, be a
truly intercontinental operation.

 

Would President Chiluba care to comment on that? He
has called for additional resources, but he has not
mentioned personnel. Do the African countries in general,
and the signatories of the Lusaka Agreement in particular,
envisage a peacekeeping force consisting of African troops,
or is the composition of the force an open question?

I now resume my function as President of the Security
Council.

I call on the representative of the Republic of Zambia
to respond to the comments and questions.
