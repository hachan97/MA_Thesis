The President: I thank Ms. Graga Machel for her
statement and the kind words she addressed to me. I
would also like to thank her for the tremendous work
that she has done in this field.

Before giving the floor to the next speaker, I
should also like to acknowledge and welcome the
presence of Mrs. Mariama Aribot, the Minister for
Social Affairs of Guinea.

I now give the floor to Ms. Carol Bellamy, the
Executive Director of the United Nations Children's
Fund.
