Mr. Gillerman (Israel): I would like to reply to
Mr. Mitri's, I believe, genuinely expressed pain about
Tyre. We share that pain; we share that pain very much.
We grieve for the destruction of Tyre. But I listened
very, very carefully to the statement made by the
Lebanese representative, and there is one word which
was curiously missing from that statement. That word
is "Hizbollah". We did not hear that word once, as if
Tyre were just a quiet peaceful town and not a hub of
terrorism from which rockets and missiles have been
fired at Haifa and other Israeli cities - as if there were
no Hizbollah, as if this all came out of nowhere. I think
that there should be at least some mention of the true
root cause of this horrible conflict, which is the fact
8
that Hizbollah has taken Lebanon, including Tyre,
hostage.

It is actually the Ambassador of Lebanon, who is
sitting behind Mr. Mitri, who said on United States
television that in Lebanon you cannot distinguish
between the Lebanese and Hizbollah. In his words,
Hizbollah is everywhere in Lebanon. Hizbollah has
infiltrated every fibre of Lebanon and, in his words,
become part of Lebanese society. To address this
painful problem, including the pain of Tyre, without
mentioning Hizbollah borders on - I will not use the
word that I wanted to use.
