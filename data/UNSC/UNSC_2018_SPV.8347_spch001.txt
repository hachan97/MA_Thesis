The President: I shall now make a statement in my
national capacity.

We sit here today on ll September. Seventeen years
after the attacks of ll September 2001, it hurts us as
much today is it did on the day it happened. I was at
the 9/11 memorial ceremony this morning. They started
reading the names. As we start this Security Council
meeting, they are still reading the names of those who
were lost. We lost thousands of people on that day. We
lost mothers and fathers. We lost sisters and brothers.
We lost sons and daughters. We lost friends. We saw
heroism at its best. We saw friends helping friends. We
saw those helping the disabled. We saw first responders
go back into burning buildings, knowing that they
might not come back out. It was the true testament of
courage, sacrifice and patriotism.

But that day taught us a lot of lessons. It taught
us the lesson that we can never let our guard down. It
taught us the lesson that evil exists. And it taught us
the lesson that we should never stop trying for peace
and security in this world. And so, when we look at
Americans and we see the United States of America
that stands today, we see that we fight harder, we defend
more passionately and we love more strongly because
we know what pain and sacrifice are. But we also know
that we will never forget.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

I ask members of the Council to stand and observe
a minute of silence.

The members of the Security Council observed a
