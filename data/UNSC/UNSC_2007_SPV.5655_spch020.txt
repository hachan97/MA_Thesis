The President: I would like to thank the Under-
Secretary-General for his briefing and for the visit he
made on this trip and for the visits he plans to make in
the future. I think it is clear from the discussion today
that there is concern in the Council at the deteriorating
humanitarian situation, particularly in the Sudan, but
increasingly in Chad and the Central African Republic
too. I think we all have conveyed today that we see a
pressing need for a political solution, both within and
between the countries we have heard about. Those
countries will naturally remain high on the Council's
agenda.

Perhaps I could, on behalf of the Council, pass on
to the Under-Secretary-General the Council's
admiration, recognition and gratitude for the
courageous, difficult and essential work done every
day by the United Nations and by other humanitarian
agencies and actors in the region we have discussed
today, and around the world. They really do deserve
our praise, thanks and support. Perhaps I could ask the
Under-Secretary-General to pass that on to his team.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
