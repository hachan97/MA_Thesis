The President: Thank you very much indeed. While
I invite the representative of South Africa to take a seat at
the Council table, I hope the Security Council will forgive
me if I say how especially delighted I am in doing so. If
anybody had suggested during those long bitter years of
struggle that either Ambassador Kumalo would be speaking
for his country at the United Nations or that I would be
representing, at a ministerial level, the British Government,
I think they would have been described as either dreamers
or mad. But here we are, and I am delighted to give the
floor to the Ambassador from South Africa.
