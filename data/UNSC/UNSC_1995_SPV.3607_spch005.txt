The President (interpretation from Russian): I thank
the representative of Croatia for his statement on the item
on the Council's agenda, as well as for his remarks on the
item to be considered next week. I also thank him for his
kind words addressed to me.

In accordance with the decision taken earlier in the
meeting, I now call upon Mr. Vladislav Jovanovic.
