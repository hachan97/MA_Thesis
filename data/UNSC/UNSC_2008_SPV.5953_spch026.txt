Mr. Khalilzad (United States of America): I am
taking the floor to respond to what Ambassador
Churkin said in his earlier statement. We heard
Ambassador Churkin's polemics, which did not
respond to the call we have made for an immediate
cessation of hostilities and a return to the status quo
ante. He has acknowledged his Government's refusal to
deal with the democratically elected President of
Georgia. He has acknowledged that this situation is no
longer about South Ossetia. He has attacked the United
Nations Secretariat. He has made specious comparisons
to other conflicts.

I want to focus, however, on one point that
Ambassador Churkin made. Ambassador Churkin
referred to his Minister's phone conversation with
Secretary of State Rice this morning. That conversation
raises serious questions about Russia's objectives in
this conflict. In that conversation, Foreign Minister
Lavrov told United States Secretary of State Rice that
the democratically elected President of Georgia - and
I quote - "must go". I quote again: "Saakashvili must
go". This is completely unacceptable and crosses the
line.

I want to ask Ambassador Churkin: is your
Government's objective regime change in Georgia, the
overthrow of the democratically elected Government of
Georgia?

Russia must affirm that its aim is not to change
the democratically elected Government of Georgia and
that it accepts the territorial integrity and sovereignty
of Georgia.

Russia is threatening the territorial integrity of
Georgia, and this Council must act decisively to
reaffirm the territorial integrity and sovereignty of
Georgia.
