Mr. Mehdiyev (Azerbaijan): I would first like
to thank Ambassador Nestor Osorio for his work as
Chairman of the Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1737 (2006) and for his comprehensive
briefing on the Committee's activities.

We note the work done so far by the Panel of
Experts created pursuant to paragraph 29 of resolution
1929 (2010) under the direction of the Committee, and
welcome the extension of its mandate until 9 July 2013.
It is essential that the Panel of Experts continue its
outreach activities, which play a key role in increasing
the number of national implementation reports from
Member States. We commend the efforts made by
the Committee to enhance the implementation of the
sanctions measures. Azerbaijan welcomes the initial
draft of the Panel's final report (S/2012/395) and stands
ready to engage in fruitful discussion in that regard.

It is of the utmost importance to the Republic of
Azerbaijan that it prevent the use of its territory as a
transit route for illicit trafficking of items and materials
related to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and
weapons technology. In our View, preventing the spread
of nuclear weapons is the most important security
challenge currently confronting the international
community. But in pursuing those goals, we cannot
deny any country's right to develop its nuclear industry
for exclusively peaceful purposes under international
supervision.
