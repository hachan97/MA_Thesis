Mr. Vilovic' (Croatia): Croatia too would like to
join other Council members in welcoming the
President of Djibouti, His Excellency Mr. Ismail Omar
Guelleh, as well as his delegation, including the
Minister for Foreign Affairs, and thanking him for the
timely and comprehensive briefing he has provided us.
We also welcome the participation of the
representatives of Eritrea at today's meeting.

We take note of the relative calm on the ground in
the region at this time, but at the same time, we are
cognizant of the overall fragility of the situation and its
potential for further flare-ups in an already volatile
region.

In that connection, we would like to recall the
Presidential statement of 12 June this year
(S/PRST/2008/20), in which all parties, but in
particular Eritrea, were called on to exercise restraint,
to withdraw their forces to the status quo ante and to
resolve the dispute through dialogue and peaceful
means, including through third-party mediation. The
proposals of the fact-finding mission are a step in that
direction. At the same time, however, the refusal of
Eritrea to accept the Secretary-General's good offices
is regrettable.

That being said, we welcome all efforts by the
United Nations and by regional organizations, in
particular the African Union and the League of Arab
States, to try to help the parties de-escalate tensions
and move towards a peaceful solution to the crisis. We
sincerely hope that those efforts will be honestly and
wholeheartedly accepted by all parties.
