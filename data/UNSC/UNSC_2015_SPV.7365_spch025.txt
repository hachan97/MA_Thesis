Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I understand that Ms. Power decided that
she had not been eloquent enough in setting out the
American position, and that her Deputy needed to
repeat some portions of her statement. I regret that
Ambassador Power has decided not to continue this
principled discussion with us on matters of international

policy.
