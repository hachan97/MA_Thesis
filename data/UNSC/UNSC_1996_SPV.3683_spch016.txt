Mr. Wlosowicz (Poland): On 27 February 1996, the
Security Council in its presidential statement requested
the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to
investigate the tragic incident of the shooting down by the
Cuban Air Force of two civil aircraft on
24 February 1996.

We have before us the resolution of the Council of
ICAO and the report of the Secretary General of that

 

organization. Our delegation welcomes both with a great
deal of appreciation. These documents confirm our strong
belief that States must refrain from resorting to the use of
weapons against civil aircraft in flight. This principle,
although codified in article 3 bis of the Chicago
Convention, is indeed very well based in customary
international law. But do we really need to quote rules of
international law to prove that unarmed civil aircraft must
not be shot down? After all, the resolution adopted by the
ICAO Council on 27 June 1996 expressly recognizes that
the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight is
incompatible with elementary considerations of humanity.
Today, we are going to condemn such acts in the Security
Council's draft resolution, hoping they will never happen
again.

The draft resolution before us reaffirms the principle
that each State shall take appropriate measures to prohibit
the deliberate use of its aircraft for purposes inconsistent
with the aims of the Chicago Convention. We value this
principle.

Before concluding, let me take this opportunity to
express my delegation's deepest sympathy to the families
of the victims of the tragic incident of 24 February 1996.
We sincerely hope that today's debate and the draft
resolution, in favour of which Poland is going to vote, will
prevent such incidents in the future.
