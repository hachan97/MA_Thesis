Mr. Lucas (Angola): We thank you, Madam, for
scheduling this meeting on such a momentous question
in international life, and to the Congolese people in
particular. We thank Under-Secretary-General
Guehenno and Deputy High Commissioner for Human
Rights Ramcharan for their briefings.

We shall comply with your request, Madam, and
not deliver a statement. We shall reserve that for the
occasion of the open debate on 18 July. However,
before addressing a question to Mr. Ramcharan, we
would like to make a brief comment.

The reports submitted to the Council on the
events that took place in Mambasa and Drodro are very
disturbing indeed. We cannot let this occasion pass
without expressing our outrage at and strongest
condemnation of such coarse violations of human
rights. We convey our deepest-felt solidarity to the
long-suffering people of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, victims of such indescribable acts of
cowardice, and we strongly assert that the authors and
instigators of these acts should by no means be allowed
to go unpunished.

The question we would like to address to Mr.
Ramcharan is the following: In the quest for peace in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where in
similar circumstances of civil strife elsewhere
reconciliation and pardon have played an important
political and psychological role - even leading
sometimes to general amnesties - is it not possible
that such crimes, such violations of human rights, will
be forgotten and that justice may be sacrificed to
superior political interests and die a widow, as has
happened so often? What is the general position of the
High Commissioner for Human Rights in such cases?
What is the High Commissioner likely to do if such a
trend emerges in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo?
