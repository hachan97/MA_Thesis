The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Mr. Koenigs for his clarifications and comments. I also
thank him once again for being with us. We hope to see
him soon, once we adopt the resolution extending the
mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in
Afghanistan, at the end of March.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 1.55 p.m.
