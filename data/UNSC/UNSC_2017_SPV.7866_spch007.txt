Mr. Wilson (United Kingdom): I join others in
welcoming the unanimous adoption of resolution 2337
(2017). I commend Senegal for its swift and decisive action
in presenting the text of resolution 2337 (2017) today.

But in truth, the Council should not have to do this.
The people of The Gambia spoke clearly at the elections
in December. They chose Adama Barrow to be their
President. Their voice now needs to be heard, and their
will needs to be heeded by just one man.

Resolution 2237 (2017) is clear: former President
Jammeh must respect the decision of the Gambian
people and immediately hand over power. His failure
to do so up until this point is only bringing uncertainty
to the people of The Gambia. Despite this setback, the
Gambian people have shown admirable restraint and
stoicism by remaining calm in the face of uncertainty.
They have given former President Jammeh time to
consider the many options that are open to him. We look
to all parties in The Gambia, particularly the security
forces, to continue to act with restraint and to maintain
that calm.

We welcome the work of the Economic Community
of West African States to resolve this. At a time of
unease in The Gambia, it is reassuring to see effective
regional leadership on display. Mr. Jammeh has been
given many opportunities by his neighbours and
partners and, most important, by the Gambian people
themselves. It is now time for him to do the right thing.
