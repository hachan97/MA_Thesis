The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

In a letter dated 5 June 2006 addressed to the
Secretary-General, the President of the Republic of
Montenegro submitted the application of his country
for membership in the United Nations. That letter has
been circulated in document S/2006/409.
Under the provisions of rule 59 of the provisional
rules of procedure of the Security Council, unless the
Council decides otherwise, an application for
membership shall be referred by the President of the
Council to the Committee on the Admission of New
Members. Accordingly, unless I hear a proposal to the
contrary, I shall refer the application of the Republic of
Montenegro to the Committee on the Admission of
New Members for examination and report.

As I hear no objection, it is so decided.

I would propose that the Committee on the
Admission of New Members meet at 3 pm. this
afternoon, in Conference Room 7, to consider the
application of the Republic of Montenegro for
membership in the United Nations.

The meeting rose at 10.10 am.
