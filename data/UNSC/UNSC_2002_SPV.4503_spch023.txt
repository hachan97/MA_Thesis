Mr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): Let me
start by saying how pleased we are, Sir, to see you
presiding over the Security Council, and to convey to
you the satisfaction I am sure I share with all other
Member States at the uniformly praiseworthy manner
in which you have conducted the work of the Council
this month.
Our gratitude goes also to the representative of
Mexico, who presided over the Council last month with
great talent and effectiveness.

The very day after the Beirut summit, at which
Arab leaders offered Israel recognition and security in
exchange for its withdrawal from the Arab territories
occupied in 1967 and the establishment of a Palestinian
State with its capital at Al-Quds - a bold and
important gesture in every respect, which was rightly
hailed by the whole international community because it
could restore just and lasting peace to that tormented
part of the world - Israel responded in the only
language it knows and that it speaks in total scorn for
international opinion: that of blind, brutal,
disproportionate and unbridled violence.

As the Security Council is holding an emergency
meeting at the request of Arab and Islamic States,
dozens of tanks and thousands of Israeli soldiers are
trooping through Ramallah - which is now besieged,
cordoned off, cut off from the world and occupied -
bringing death and destruction. The very headquarters
of the Palestinian Authority, until now safe from the
destructive madness of the Israeli forces, is now in
ruins: tanks have penetrated to the very heart of
Chairman Arafat's residence; Israeli forces have killed
several of his aides and wounding dozens of others,
and have arrested an unknown number of people.

The life of Chairman Arafat - the uncontested
leader of the Palestinian people, the democratically
elected President of the Palestinian Authority and the
interlocutor who is essential to any negotiation - is
now under grave threat; his freedom of movement has
been reduced to the bare minimum. But his prestige
and his moral authority among his people, who are
rallying around him in this moment of adversity, are
great than ever. Even as his offices are in flames, his
infrastructure destroyed, his police force crushed, his
communications cut, he is being required to curb the
rage of a people living daily under occupation,
repression and humiliation, and to control the
legitimate uprising that is constantly fuelled by the
unheard-of violence and the ever increasing repression.

The fact is that this new Israeli aggression is
aimed at smashing the peace process set in motion at
the Beirut summit on the false pretext of responding to
acts caused by the acute frustration of a people that has
lived under occupation for generations, at damaging
the credibility of the Palestinian Authority, at breaking
down its machinery and at making it unable to meet its
obligations while continually demanding that it take
drastic action against isolated acts of violence that
nothing can either prevent or control with the few
resources the Authority possesses and given the chaos,
confusion and terror that prevail in the Palestinian
territories.

Israel's scorched-earth policy aims ultimately at
discrediting and disqualifying the very concept of a
viable and responsible Palestinian State - which is the
final goal of the peace process and which has been
recognized and enshrined by the Security Council. The
result of this negative policy is that today the Middle
East is closer than ever to the brink of widespread
confrontation. In view of this situation it is imperative
for the international community to stop being a passive
observer of the Middle East, which is awash in
violence, and to shoulder its responsibility with
courage and determination before the region lapses into
total war with tragic consequences for all.

Here, the Security Council, given its special
responsibility for the maintenance of international
peace and security, must become directly involved by
calling for an immediate cessation of the present Israeli
aggression; by calling for the withdrawal of Israeli
security forces from Ramallah and all other occupied
Palestinian areas; by demanding the immediate lifting
of the restrictions imposed on Chairman Arafat; by
taking a decision on ways to provide the Palestinian
people with the protection it is entitled to expect of the
international community, including by deploying
international observers; by urging Israel to respect the
provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to
the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of
12 August 1949; and by calling for the complete
implementation, as a matter of urgency, of the
recommendations of the Mitchell report and the Tenet
plan.

More than ever, Algeria is convinced that peace is
a strategic choice and that there is no alternative to
returning to the negotiating table; we remain strongly
committed to a peaceful, just, lasting and
comprehensive settlement, as formally proposed at the
Arab summit just held at Beirut: a settlement based on
international law as embodied in Security Council
resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and on Israel's
respect for its commitments under the peace process, in
particular the principle of land for peace, agreed upon
at Madrid, which would make possible the
establishment of a Palestinian State with Al-Quds as its
capital.
