Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Unfortunately, our discussion today did not
reach the requisite level of objective analysis with
respect to the implementation of the Minsk agreements
and resolution 2202 (2015). The pervasive lies in the
statement of the representative of the United States of
America prove that throughout the crisis in Ukraine,
from its inception right to today, Washington, DC, by
supporting its Kyiv partners, is playing a destructive
role that departs from the context of the Normandy
format. That is certainly one of the reasons that work on
a political settlement is not so simple. Frankly speaking,
there was no greater objectivity in the statement by
the Ukrainian Minister for Foreign Affairs. Most
important, he did not say that the Ukrainian leadership
understood its responsibility for implementing the
Minsk agreements of 12 February and resolution
2202 (2015), which made that into a legally binding
document. The Kyiv authorities did the opposite - and

not just once - they undermined the opportunity for a
political settlement to the crisis in Ukraine.

Under both the Normandy format and in the
Tripartite Contact Group, Russia is carrying out its
responsibilities. It will continue to do so. We hope that
the political will necessary for the implementation of
the Minsk agreements and resolution 2202 (2015) will
prevail in the end among the Ukrainian authorities as
well. Perhaps it really is time for a new approach.
