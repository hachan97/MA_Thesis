The President: I thank the representative of the
Republic of Korea for those provocative and valuable
suggestions, which I hope we will all consider.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of the Libyan Arab J amahiriya. I invite him
to take a seat at the Council table and to make his
statement.
