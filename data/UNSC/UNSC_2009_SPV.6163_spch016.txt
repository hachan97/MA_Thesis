Ms. Chen Peijie (China) (spoke in Chinese): At
the outset, I would like to thank President Winter and
Prosecutor Rapp of the Special Court for Sierra Leone
for their briefings. We also welcome the presence at
this meeting of the representative of Sierra Leone.

We have taken note of the fact that over the past
two years the Special Court has continued to make
progress in its work, including the finalization of two
trials. That means that only two trials remain to be
completed. We express our appreciation for that
progress. As the trials and appeals approach
completion, the goals set in the Special Court's
completion strategy are coming into sight. We are
pleased to note that the Special Court's judicial
activities could conclude in early 2011. We look
forward to that.

China has always supported the work of the
Special Court. We anticipate that the Court will
continue effectively its work on both trials and appeals,
that it will successfully address legacy issues in an
appropriate and effective manner and that it will
achieve the goals set out in its completion strategy in
an appropriate and timely way. We hope that countries
in a position to do so will continue to support the
Special Court in order to help it to overcome the
difficulties it faces and assist it to effectively carry out
its completion strategy.
