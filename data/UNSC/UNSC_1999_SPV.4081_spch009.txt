The President: I thank Ambassador Fowler for the
work he is doing on Angola. This is a critical time for
making sure that sanctions against UNITA are biting and
that they are effective.

Let me say also that I have just been passed a note
saying that Ambassador Holbrooke spoke for 4 minutes 57
seconds. Obviously, stopwatches are becoming just as
prevalent as mobile phones in the Security Council. The
discipline is admirable.
