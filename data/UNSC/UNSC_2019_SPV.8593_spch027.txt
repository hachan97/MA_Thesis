Mr. Falouh (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): In response to what the Permanent
Representative of the United Kingdom has said today,
which is similar to what she has said in previous
meetings in which the situation in Syria has been
discussed, I would like to reaffirm yet again that asking
questions is the right of all parties concerned as long as
the sole purpose is to reach serious solutions based on
the Charter of the United Nations and the resolutions of
the Security Council, all of which have stipulated the
need to respect the sovereignty, independence, unity
and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic as
well as the need to eradicate terrorism, putting an end
to it in all its forms, including the support for it.

I would therefore like to ask the Permanent
Representative of the United Kingdom, as well as the
representatives of Governments that have an illegal
military presence in my country, Syria, to inform the
Security Council of the date when they will end their
aggressive and illegal military presence and activities
on Syrian soil. I would also ask that they inform the
Council when they intend to put an end to the unilateral
coercive economic measures imposed on the Syrian
people through which they are seeking to undermine
the reconstruction process and the return of refugees
and internally displaced persons to their homes. I would
also like them to inform the Council ofwhen they intend
to put an end to their interference in a political process
that is supposed to be Syrian-led and Syrian-owned,
without any foreign interference whatsoever. Most
importantly, I would ask that these countries inform
the Security Council of their position with respect to
the terrorist activities of Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham and
the Al-Nusra Front in Idlib and other areas in north-
western Syria. Together with other terrorist groups,
comprised in part of thousands of foreign terrorist
fighters, the Al-Nusra Front is using crossing points
along the border with Turkey to smuggle terrorists and
weapons and funds into Syria.
