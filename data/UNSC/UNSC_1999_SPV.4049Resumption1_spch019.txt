The President: I thank the Minister for Foreign
Affairs of Ukraine for his kind words addressed to my
Government.

The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received letters from the representatives of the
Comoros and Ghana in which they request to be invited
to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice,
I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion, without the

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Abond

reserved for them at the side of the Council
Chamber.


The President: The next speaker is the Deputy
Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the
Republic of Yemen, His Excellency Mr. Abdul-Qader Ba-
J ammal. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table
and to make his statement now.
