Mr. ngowe (Botswana): During the meeting at
which resolution 1054 (1996) was adopted, on 26 April
1996, my delegation expressed the hope and the belief
that the Government of the Sudan would comply fully
with the demands of resolution 1044 (1996). We
expressed confidence in the ability of the Sudan to avoid
an escalation of the situation by facilitating the handover
of the three suspects to Ethiopia for prosecution.

Let me reiterate once again that, as an African
country, Botswana harbours no ill feelings or intentions
towards the brotherly people of the Sudan. Reason,
however, dictates that the suspects who made an attempt
on the life of President Mubarak of Egypt must be
brought to justice in accordance with the demands of
resolutions 1044 (1996) and 1054 (1996). We trust that
this time our brothers in the Sudan will fully comply with
those resolutions and thus avoid a situation in which the
Security Council might be pushed into taking certain
actions to ensure compliance with its resolutions. The
draft resolution before the Council specifies possible
measures that may be imposed against the Sudan in case
of continued lack of compliance with prior resolutions. It
definitely gives the Sudan ample time to implement the
resolutions of the Council. It would be most unfortunate
indeed if at the end of the 90-day grace period the
Council were to find itself with no option but to impose
the measures foreseen in the present draft resolution.

I wish to conclude by once again imploring the
Government of Sudan to comply fully with the demands
of resolutions 1044 (1996) and 1054 (1996). We hope the
Government of the Sudan will respond positively to the
demands of those resolutions and that the draft resolution
on which we are about to vote will be the last to be
adopted by the Council on this question.
