The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
 

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Observer

Members of the Council also have before them

resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations.

It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before
it. If I hear no objection, I shall now put the draft

The President: There were 15 votes in favour. The
draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1180 (1998).
The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda. The

Security Council will remain seized of the matter.
