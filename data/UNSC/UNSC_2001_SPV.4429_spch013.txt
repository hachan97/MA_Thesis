The President: As was agreed in our prior
consultations, the format for the remainder of this
meeting will take the form of an interactive dialogue.
As a result, no list of speakers for members of the
Council has been drawn up. Let me invite those
members who wish to make comments or address
questions to Judge Jorda, Judge Pillay and Ms. Del
Ponte to so indicate to the secretariat from now on.
