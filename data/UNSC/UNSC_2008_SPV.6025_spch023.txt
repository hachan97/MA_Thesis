Mr. Hyseni: I would like to give a very short
reaction to express my deep satisfaction with the very
clear support the Council gives to the deployment of
the European Union Rule of Law Mission (EULEX)
throughout Kosovo. I wish also to take this opportunity
to extend our thanks to Member States for their
contributions to the EULEX deployment and I want
once again to ensure all the nations that will participate
in EULEX that it will enjoy the full support and
cooperation of the institutions and people of Kosovo.

In conclusion, I should like, once again, to
emphasize clearly that it is critical that EULEX deploy
throughout Kosovo and that all of Kosovo's citizens
benefit from the EULEX presence in our country. We
appreciate the mandate assigned to EULEX and we
have definitely enshrined the EULEX presence in our
constitution and all of our post-independence
documents, including in more than 40 pieces of
legislation passed in accordance with the
Comprehensive Status Settlement Proposal of Nobel
Peace Prize Laureate Martti Ahtisaari.
