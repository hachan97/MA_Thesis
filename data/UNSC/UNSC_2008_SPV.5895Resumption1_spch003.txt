The President: I thank the Chairman of the
Peacebuilding Commission for his statement and for
his comments in his capacity as representative of
Japan. I think we are all agreed as to the centrality and
importance of the Commission in this work.

I now have the pleasure of giving the floor to the
representative of Egypt.
