The President (interpretation from Arabic): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Canada and Haiti in which they
request to be invited to participate in the discussion of the
item on the Council's agenda. In accordance with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the discussion
without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Lelong (Haiti)
took a seat at the Council table; Mr. Fowler (Canada)
took the seat reserved for him at the side of the
Council Chamber.

The President (interpretation from Arabic): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Mission in
Haiti, document S/ 1996/416 and addendum 1/revision 1.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/ 1996/478, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to the following other documents: S/ 1996/431,
letter dated 10 June 1996 from the Secretary-General
addressed to the President of the Security Council; and
S/ 1996/432, letter dated 12 June 1996 from the Permanent
Representative of El Salvador to the United Nations
addressed to the Secretary-General.
