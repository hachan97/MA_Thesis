The President: I very much thank Mr. Brahimi
for having drawn on his experience so frankly to
challenge the Council to take seriously its words about
national ownership and local solutions.

Speakers have referred to the succinctness and
shortness of the United Kingdom's concept paper, and
it falls to me to ask that speakers be equally short and
succinct in their contributions to this debate. In
accordance with the understanding reached among
Council members, I must remind speakers that their
contributions to the debate should be no longer than
five minutes. Delegations with longer statements are
kindly requested to distribute the texts in writing and to
limit their spoken remarks to five minutes only. We
have 20 speakers to hear before lunch and an additional
35 speakers after lunch, so we need to make progress.

I now invite His Excellency Mr. Gordan
Jandrokovic', Minister for Foreign Affairs and
European Integration of Croatia, who has just arrived
from his country, to take the floor.
