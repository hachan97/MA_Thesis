The President: In light of the time, I would remind
members again that we are trying to operate under what I
would call the Greenstock rules of short, non-repetitive
speeches. A lot of issues have already been raised, and I
hope for a maximum exchange of views with Mrs. Ogata,
because our purpose here is to give her our points of view
and learn from her so we can factor it into the remainder
of the month and beyond.
