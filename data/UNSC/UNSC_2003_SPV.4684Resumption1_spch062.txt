Mr. Otunnu: I have taken very careful note of
the extremely important comments and critiques made
by members of the Security Council and other
Members of the United Nations. I shall be in
continuing dialogue with them, and I shall do
everything possible to act on the suggestions and
proposals which have been made. At this late hour, I do
not intend to respond or to elaborate on any specific
suggestion or proposal. Thank you very much, Sir, for
your interest and engagement and the commitment of
the Security Council.
