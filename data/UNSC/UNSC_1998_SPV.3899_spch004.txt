Mr. Van Dunem "Mbinda" (Angola): On behalf of
the Government of the Republic of Angola and on my own
behalf, I should like to express our deepest sorrow at the
unexpected death of the African fighter for just causes,
Maitre Alioune Blondin Beye, Special Representative of the
Secretary-General of the United Nations for the peace
process in Angola.

The death of Mr. Beye occurred in very sad
circumstances, and at a crucial phase of our peace process.
There is no doubt that it will prove an irreparable loss. His
dedication to the struggle for peace in Angola, once again
demonstrated during his mission to a number of African
countries in search of support for the effective conclusion
of the Lusaka Protocol, was a true testimony to his
humanism and an example of his sacrifice, which were
without precedent in the history of African diplomacy.

During his five years as head of the peace process in
Angola, Maitre Alioune Blondin Beye was a dedicated
friend to Angola and to the Angolans. That is why we are
saying here that his death is not only a loss for the peace
process in Angola but also for Africa and for all of
humanity. His sacrifice, his spirit of humanism and his total
dedication even at the most difficult moments - such as
this moment in the peace process in Angola - will stay
in the memory of the Angolan people. At this moment of
grief, on behalf of my Government, we would like to pay
our profound homage to him. To the grieving family, to
the friendly Government of Mali and to the entire United
Nations family, the Mission of Angola to the United
Nations, on behalf of the Angolan Government, transmits
its most profound condolences, which extend also to the
rest of the delegation with which Mr. Beye lost his life.

May his soul rest in peace.
