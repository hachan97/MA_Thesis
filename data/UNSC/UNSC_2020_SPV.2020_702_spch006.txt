Indonesia is delighted that the Council finally adopted resolution 2533 (2020), regarding the cross-border mechanism in Syria. We know that this resolution is not satisfactory to everyone. However, my delegation believes that the text submitted by the co-penholders is the result of a compromise among Council members, and it serves as the urgent formula for the Council to continue assisting the Syrian people. In that context, my delegation would like to thank the co-penholders, Belgium and Germany, for their tireless efforts and commitment in facilitating the entire process. Obviously, the issue of the humanitarian situation in Syria will not be fully resolved only with the authorization of this mechanism. We encourage all key parties to remain committed to their obligations to protect civilians under international law and international humanitarian law, particularly to ensure that humanitarian assistance reaches people in need throughout Syria without delay. My delegation wishes to once again emphasize the importance of increasing the cross-line deliveries, in close cooperation with the Syrian Government, the United Nations and key humanitarian partners. Indeed, a combination of cross-border and cross-line deliveries is required to sustain humanitarian assistance. The Council's responsibility does not end with this resolution. There are still many tasks for us to alleviate the impact of the conflict on the Syrian people.
