Mr. Abarry (Niger) (spoke in French): Through you, Mr. President, I would like to convey my thanks to Under-Secretary-General Lowcock for his briefing. How can we not be concerned about the continued fighting between Government troops and armed groups in Idlib province, which, unfortunately, continues to drive civilians from their homes in this very cold weather. The 20,000 people displaced in the past few days must draw our attention. We reiterate our appeal to the parties to the conflict to respect their obligations in terms of protection of civilians and to allow humanitarian workers access to those severely affected by the ongoing hostilities. The Niger commends the efforts of the humanitarian agencies in their daily work to provide assistance to those in need, which should be made possible throughout Syria; We urge all stakeholders to commit to a ceasefire to give the resumption of dialogue a chance in the context of the political process. The first stage of that must be an end to the violence.My delegation would like to reaffirm its support for the cross-border mechanism for the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Syria, whose mandate we renewed on 10 January (see S/PV.8700). That aid is not being fully delivered. We must recognize that, and further efforts must be made. Moreover, that is why we eagerly await the report of the Secretary-General on that issue. We must listen to the messages from the Under- Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs so as to respond in the best possible way to the calls for help from the thousands of women and children who are so badly in need of such assistance and are, I would say, in distress. In conclusion, as I have said in the past, a united Security Council, particularly with regard to humanitarian matters, is an effective Council, one whose decisions take into account what is the most important, that is, life and the survival of millions of Syrians who are counting on us.
