Mr. Heusgen (Germany): I will be brief. I am not
predisposed to get into discussions with our Russian
colleague, but I am predisposed to defend international
humanitarian law and human rights, and I am doing that
in implementation of the Charter of the United Nations
and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It may
not be for me to criticize Chinese positions, but it is
for me to uphold international law and international
humanitarian law, and the term "international
humanitarian law" was not mentioned in either the
Russian or the Chinese statement.
