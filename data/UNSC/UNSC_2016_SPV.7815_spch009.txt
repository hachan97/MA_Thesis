Mr. Akahori (Japan): Japan welcomes the
unanimous adoption of resolution 2319 (2016). The
resolution is particularly important given that, to our
deepest regret, additional allegations of chemical
weapons use in Syria have been continuously reported.
It is a grave challenge to the international norm of
prohibited chemical weapons. We need to firmly
uphold that norm. It is critically important in that
regard to uncover the whole picture of the alleged use of
chemical weapons in Syria and hold accountable those
who are responsible.
The Security Council is sending a strong and
clear message by renewing the mandate of the Joint
Investigative Mechanism to identify those who are
responsible for the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
Japan is ready to engage in a constructive manner to
enable the Mechanism to accomplish its work even
more effectively.
