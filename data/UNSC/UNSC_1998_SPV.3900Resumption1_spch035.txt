The President: I thank the representative of Cuba for
the kind words he addressed to me.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is Mr. Ali Al-
Salafi, Charge d'affaires ad interim of the Office of the
Permanent Observer for the League of Arab States to the
United Nations, to whom the Council has extended an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table
and to make his statement.
