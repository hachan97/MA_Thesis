Mrs. Albright (United States of America): Today
the Security Council sends a clear message to all the
people of Burundi: the violence must stop.

In a letter to the Burundian President, Sylvestre
Ntibantunganya, that I personally carried to Burundi for
President Clinton, the American President called on all
Burundians to reject extremism and resolve their
differences peacefully. The United States will not support,
recognize, or provide assistance to any government that
comes to power by force in Burundi. Indeed, the United
States would lead an effort to isolate such a regime.
 

Escalating violence in Burundi has pitted the Tutsi
minority against the Hutu majority, resulting in widespread
human rights abuses. A wave of killings has claimed the
lives of hundreds of civilians each week, and the Tutsi-
dominated military and its auxiliary forces have driven
many Hutus out of the capital, Bujumbura. A rural Hutu
insurgency is fighting back, targeting both Tutsi civilians
and the military. According to the Special Rapporteur of the
United Nations Commission on Human Rights, a
smouldering civil war is spreading further and further in
Burundi, giving rise to an increasingly marked genocidal
trend.

Aid workers fear for their lives in Burundi. Security
for humanitarian workers must be increased or they will
have to leave the country. The United States calls on the
Government of Burundi to guarantee the safety of aid
workers.

The United States deplores the continuing instability
and violence in Burundi. The United States, along with
other donor countries, is seeking ways to defuse tensions in
that country. The United States urges the leaders of Burundi
to isolate the extremists and seek a lasting peace.
Ultimately, it is the people of Burundi who have it in their
hands to prevent their country from falling into an abyss. It
is up to the Burundians to ensure that Burundi does not
commit national suicide.
