Mr. Lucas (Angola): I am grateful to you for
convening this meeting, Mr. President, and would
like to thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for
his briefing on the outbreak of hostilities in eastern
Ukraine.

In our meeting on Wednesday, 21 January
(see S/PV. 7365), the Angolan delegation expressed its
position on the issue in the wake ofthe attack on a bus in
the Donetsk region that resulted in a number of civilian
casualties. We would like to take this opportunity to
reiterate our position, while condemning the recent
attack on Mariupol and the loss of life and extensive
destruction of property. I will be brief.

We regret the loss of lives in the recent outbreak
of hostilities in eastern Ukraine and emphasize the
urgent need to protect civilians. We condemn the
violations of the ceasefire and urge all the parties to
observe it. We believe that the Minsk accords constitute
a framework for a peaceful solution to the conflict,
and we urge all parties to abide by them. We stress the
importance of respect for the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Ukraine. Finally, we believe it is crucial
that humanitarian assistance be provided to the victims
of the conflict and that efforts stepped up to help the
thousands in need.
