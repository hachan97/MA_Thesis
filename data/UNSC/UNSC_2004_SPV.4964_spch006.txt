Mr. Konuzin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I too am glad to welcome Mr. Passy to this
Council meeting. In Russia we value highly the close
cooperation between the United Nations and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE). From the Council agenda alone, we could
refer to Tajikistan; Abkhazia, Georgia; Macedonia; and
Bosnia and Herzegovina. We especially note the OSCE
contribution to the implementation of Security Council
resolution 1244 (1999) on Kosovo, Serbia and
Montenegro. The OSCE mission in that province,
along with the United Nations Interim Administration
Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), is playing an important
role in preparing for local elections and in establishing
the multi-ethnic Kosovo Police Service, as well as in
the observance of human rights and the monitoring of
local media.

The OSCE has provided us with very good
reports, with preliminary analysis of the activities of
the Kosovo print and electronic mass media during the
broad-based, ethnically motivated violence that took
place in Kosovo between 17 and 20 March. It is well
known that, as many local mass media took a very
negative stance, propaganda was broadcast. Anti-
Serbian views were propagated and highly tendentious
and inflammatory materials were distributed, which did
not promote tolerance, but rather encouraged ethnic
cleansing in the province.

In that connection, I would like to hear what steps
Mr. Passy intends to take within the OSCE Mission in
Kosovo to prevent future repetition of extremist
manifestations in the local media of Kosovo.
