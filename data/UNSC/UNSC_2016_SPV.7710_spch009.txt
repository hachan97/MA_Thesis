Mr. Gimolieca (Angola): We thank the Prosecutor
of the International Criminal Court, Ms. Fatou
Bensouda, for her briefing on the current judicial
activities of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and
on the situation in Darfur, as set out in the twenty-third
report submitted to the Security Council pursuant to
resolution 1593 (2005).

As a member of the African Union, the Republic
of Angola reiterates the African position regarding the
activities of the International Criminal Court vis-a-vis
sitting African Presidents. It should be recalled that, at
the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the
African Union held in in January and June 2015, in Addis
Ababa and in Johannesburg, respectively, the African
Union requested the suspension of the proceedings of
the ICC against the President of the Sudan, Mr. Omar
Al-Bashir, and urged the Security Council to withdraw
its referral of the case.

In a letter dated 8 February 2016 addressed to the
President ofthe Security Council, the Chairperson ofthe
African Union Commission communicated the African
Union's resolve to send to New York a ministerial
committee of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs on the
issue of the ICC to discuss with the Security Council
the African Union's concerns in its relationship with
the ICC. We look forward to that visit and expect that
a more constructive relationship between the African
Union and the Security Council with regard to the ICC
will emerge from that interaction.

Angola upholds the African Union position on these
issues while advocating for dialogue as the sole solution
to address and settle the political dispute in Darfur.
