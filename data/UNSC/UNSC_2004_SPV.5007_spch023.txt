The President: Recent discussions of the
Security Council have confirmed that cooperation
between the United Nations and regional organizations
and arrangements is based upon the United Nations
Charter, including when it comes to peacekeeping and
stabilization processes. This practice and some of
Ambassador Konuzin's suggestions should be
attentively considered in the future as well.

I now give the floor to Mr. Alounkeo Kittikhoun,
Chairperson of the Standing Committee of the
Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN).
