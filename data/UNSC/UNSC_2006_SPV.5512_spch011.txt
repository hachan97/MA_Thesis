Mr. Duclos (France) (spoke in French): France
aligns itself with the statement that will be made by
Finland on behalf of the European Union.

France would like to express its appreciation for
the report of the Secretary-General and to thank
Mr. Ian Martin, his Special Envoy, for the excellent
work he has carried out on behalf of the United
Nations.

Timor-Leste experienced violent security
disturbances immediately following the withdrawal of
the United Nations presence from its territory. Those
disturbances led to the complete disintegration of the
police force in Dili. Mr. Ian Martin has also informed
us that the Timorese police has also been much
weakened in the provinces and that Timorese society is
more divided now than it was following independence.

That bitter assessment leads us to the conclusion
that there is a need for a long-term recommitment by
the United Nations in Timor-Leste. In that respect,
France supports the recommendation made by the
Secretary-General in his report, which we believe to be
consistent with what is needed in terms of the mandate
and the composition of the mission, as well as with the
requests that have been made by the Timorese Prime
Minister, Mr. Ramos-Horta, in his letter dated
4 August.

We are, of course, now prepared to draft and
adopt a resolution. As the Ambassador of Japan pointed
out, there are still some outstanding questions with
regard to the form that an international military
presence should take in Timor-Leste. I would like from
the outset to express our gratitude for the action led by
Portugal, Malaysia, New Zealand and Australia on the
ground.

We will adapt our proposal essentially in the light
of the expectations of the Government of Timor-Leste
itself. In that regard, I would like to say that we will
not establish our final position until we have heard the
Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Timor-
Leste, Mr. Jose Luis Guterres, whose presence we
welcome here.
