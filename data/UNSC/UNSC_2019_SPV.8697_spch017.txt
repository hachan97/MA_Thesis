Mr. Van Shalkwyk (South Africa): South
Africa is extremely disappointed that the mandate
of the Syrian cross-border humanitarian assistance
mechanism could not be renewed today. During the
course of the negotiations, South Africa's position
was and remains that we must ensure the renewal of
that lifesaving humanitarian assistance programme.
South Africa voted in favour of both draft resolutions
(S/20l9/961 and S/2019/962) in an effort to accomplish
that goal, as lifesaving assistance to the people of Syria
remains critical.

Today's unfortunate outcome, or rather
non-outcome, is an indictment of our failure to carry
out our responsibility as the Security Council. It once
again underscores the need for us to evaluate the
decision-making processes of the Council, particularly
the need for concurring votes of the permanent
members. We urge all parties to continue efforts and
consultations to ensure that the cross-border assistance
mandate is renewed before 10 January 2020.
