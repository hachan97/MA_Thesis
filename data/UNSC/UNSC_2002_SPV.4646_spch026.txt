The President (spoke in Chinese): I thank the
representative of Denmark for her kind words
addressed to me.

There are eight speakers remaining on my list,
and Mr. Sharma would also like to respond to the
questions raised during the debate. However, as time is
running out for this morning's meeting, I will give the
floor to one more speaker before suspending the
meeting.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Indonesia. I invite him to take a seat
at the Council table and to make his statement.
