The President: (spoke in French): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Benin, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In accordance with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Zinsou
(Benin) took the seat reservedfor him at the side
ofthe Council Chamber

(spoke in English)

I now give the floor to the representative of
Norway.
