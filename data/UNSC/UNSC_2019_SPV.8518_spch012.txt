Mr. Trullols Yabra (Dominican Republic) (spoke in Spanish): We would like to express our satisfaction
for the adoption of resolution 2468 (2019), which
renews the mandate of the United Nations Mission
for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO),
thanking the United States for the work done in drafting
a resolution that we consider balanced. The Dominican
Republic voted in favour of the resolution because we
consider it necessary to support the political process to
resolve the situation in Western Sahara, emphasizing
the importance of the role of MINURSO.

We understand that a l2-month renewal would
allow more certainty in the management and planning
of MINURSO's resources, so we hope that the next
negotiation can embark on a discussion that will
highlight the benefits ofa longer period. The Dominican
Republic considers that the autonomy plan presented
by Morocco represents a serious and credible basis for
a negotiated solution.

Finally, the Dominican Republic reiterates its
support for the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General
for Western Sahara and urges all actors present in the
negotiation process to continue to work constructively,
always maintaining the spirit of compromise that
must prevail in this process. We are convinced that
it is possible to achieve a just, lasting and mutually
acceptable solution in Western Sahara in accordance
with Security Council resolutions.
