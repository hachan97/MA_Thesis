The President (interpretation from Russian): As this
is the first meeting of the Security Council for the month
of June, I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute,
on behalf of the Council, to His Excellency Mr. Park Soo
Gil, Permanent Representative of the Republic of Korea to
the United Nations, for his service as President of the
Security Council for the month of May 1997, and to his
entire delegation for their outstanding work. I am sure I
speak for all members of the Security Council in expressing
deep appreciation to Ambassador Park for the great
diplomatic skill and unfailing courtesy with which he
conducted the Council's business last month.
