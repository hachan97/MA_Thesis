Mr. Li Baodong (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
thank Under-Secretary-General Lynn Pascoe for his
briefing.

China is closely following the unfolding situation
in Syria. Syria is an important country in the Middle
East. We hope that the various parties there will resolve
their differences through political dialogue and address
the current crisis in an appropriate manner, so as to
maintain stability and order in the country.

We welcome the fact that the Government of
Syria recently lifted the state of emergency and
announced political reforms and the launch of national
dialogue. It has also decided to investigate all recent
incidents. We hope that these measures will help to
promote the achievement of the aforementioned
objectives.

The turbulence in some countries in the Middle
East and North Africa is a matter of deep concern. It
has not only had a negative impact on peace and
stability in these countries, but has also significantly
undermined stability of the region. How to address

these issues is a common challenge that we all face. It
is also a common task, because if these issues are not
addressed appropriately, they will threaten peace and
stability in other regions and have a significant
negative impact on the recovery of the world economy.

Therefore, with regard to the events that have
taken place in these countries, we hope that the
international community will offer constructive help in
line with the purposes and principles of the United
Nations Charter.
