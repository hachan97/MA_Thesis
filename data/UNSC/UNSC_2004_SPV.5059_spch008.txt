Mr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese):
I should like first of all to thank the Chairman of the
Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), Ambassador
Denisov, and the Executive Director of the Counter-
Terrorism Executive Directorate (CTED), Ambassador
Ruperez, for their briefings. I would like to express our
appreciation to Ambassador Denisov for the effective
work of the CTC under his leadership. We welcome the
13th 90-day work programme of the CTC.

I would like to make three brief comments. First,
we support the efforts to reform and revitalize the
CTC. We believe that it strengthens the central role of
the Security Council in international cooperation to
combat terrorism. We welcome resolution 1566 (2004),
which the Council recently adopted. We also hope that
the organizational plan of the CTED will be put into
operation as soon as possible.

Secondly, China appreciates the fact that the CTC
has done a great deal of work in evaluating Member
States' assistance needs in combating terrorism. We
welcome the fact that the CTC sent missions to visit
the States concerned so as to learn on the ground about
the situation of those States with regard to the
implementation of resolution 1373 (2001). China has
already submitted its report to the CTC concerning our
assistance needs and has provided information about
the assistance that we are able to provide to others in
the fight against terrorism. China would like to engage
in cooperation with all other parties in that respect.

Thirdly, China appreciates the fact that the CTC
is continuing to adhere to the operational principle of
openness and transparency. We welcome the fact that
the CTC has strengthened its cooperation with the
relevant international, regional and subregional
organizations and United Nations agencies. We also
hope that the CTC will coordinate and communicate
with the working group to be established by the
Security Council pursuant to resolution 1566 (2004).
