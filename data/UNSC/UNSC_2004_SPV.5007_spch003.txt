The President: I thank the Secretary-General for
his statement and for his kind words addressed to me.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers
to limit their statements to no more than five minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate their texts in writing and
to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.

As another measure to optimize the use of our
time in order to allow as many delegations as possible
to take the floor, I will not individually invite speakers
to take seats at the table or invite them to resume their
seats at the side of the Council Chamber. When a
speaker is taking the floor, the conference officer will
seat the next speaker on the list at the table.

I give the floor to Mr. Luis Ernesto Derbez,
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Mexico.
