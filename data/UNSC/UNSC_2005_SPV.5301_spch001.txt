The President (spoke in Russian): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
photocopies of a letter dated 2 November 2005 from
the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the
Security Council concerning the status of funds in the
escrow account attributable to the United Nations
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission
established by resolution 1284 (1999). This letter will
be issued as a document of the Council under the
symbol S/2005/702.

Members of the Council also have before them
the draft of a letter that I, as President of the Security
Council, propose to send to the Secretary-General in
reply to his letter, approving the proposal contained in
the Secretary-General's letter that $2,182,168 plus
â‚¬226,493 be transferred from the aforementioned
escrow account to be credited against assessments
issued in respect of the obligations of the Government
of Iraq for the budget of the International Atomic
Energy Agency.

In the absence of objection, I shall consider that
the Security Council endorses the proposal of the
Secretary-General and agrees that I should send the
letter as drafted to the Secretary-General.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The reply will be issued as a document of the
Council under the symbol 8/2005/703.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 12.20 p.m.
