Mr. Gata Mavita wa Lufuta (Democratic Republic of Congo) (spoke in French): I appreciate the
rectification that the representative of Rwanda has
just made. It is a commemoration in which we will all
participate, because what his country experienced was
sad and we cannot accept it.

I would also like to take this opportunity to say we
do not have a culture of impunity in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo. I think that what we say at this
tabledeserves a minimum of respect because it is said
in the name of the authorities of our countries. I had
already said it last time - the Ambassador of Rwanda
should learn to respect other countries, to respect us, to
respect the authorities of my country.

We will therefore no longer accept that type of
language. As Ijust said, as a member of the Security
Council, he should not say or do certain things. He has
no right to that. In response to everything he just said,
which offends my country, I invite him to have respect
for my country and for the authorities of my country.
