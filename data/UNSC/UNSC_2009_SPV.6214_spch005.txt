The President: I thank the Permanent
Representative of Nepal for his kind words addressed
to the Council, to me personally and to the members of
the Council.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. In accordance with the understanding reached in
the Council's prior consultations, I now invite Council
members to informal consultations to continue our
discussion on the subject.
