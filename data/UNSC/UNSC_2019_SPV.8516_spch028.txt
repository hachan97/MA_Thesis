The President: In addition to the questions asked
of the briefers, in my national capacity I would like to
add one further question for Mr. Apakan with regard to
his work and that of the monitors of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Can he tell
from the statistics where access for the OSCE Special
Monitoring Mission to Ukraine is most impeded? Is it
more in the Ukrainian Government-controlled area or
in the area that is not controlled by the Government?

I now give the floor to Assistant Secretary-General
Mueller to respond to comments and questions raised.
