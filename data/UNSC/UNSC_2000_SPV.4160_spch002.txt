Mr. Eldon (United Kingdom): Every delegation
has the right to ask for a break in the meeting, as you
know, Sir, and we would not object if the
representative of Russia wished to do that. I would
simply point out, though, that the matter that we are
currently considering is urgent and that we have
already spent a long time considering it. As far as my
delegation is concerned, we hope very much that the
break will be brief and that we will be able to resume
this formal meeting extremely quickly.
