The President: Members of the Council have before
them document S/1999/904, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations.

It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/1999/904) before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall
put the draft resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Argentina, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, China, France,
Gabon, Gambia, Malaysia, Namibia, Netherlands,
Russian Federation, Slovenia, United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of
America

The President: There were 15 votes in favour. The
draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1262 (1999).

Following consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"On the eve of the ballot, the members of the
Security Council wish me to affirm their View, set
out in document S/PRST/ 1999/20, that the popular
consultation of the East Timorese people on 30
August represents a historic opportunity to resolve
the question of East Timor peacefully. The people of
East Timor have a unique opportunity to decide their
own future. Whatever the outcome of the
consultation, members of the Security Council
strongly hope that the people of East Timor will
respect that decision and work together to build a
peaceful and prosperous future. In adopting the
resolution mandating the United Nations presence
until 30 November 1999, the Council is
demonstrating its readiness to continue to support
them after they have made their decision."

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 11.25 am.
