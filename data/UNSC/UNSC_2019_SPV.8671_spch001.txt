I wish to draw the attention of Council members to
document S/2019/884, which contains the report of the

I also draw colleagues' attention to the fact that
we have a lot to get through this morning and that we
also have consultations, so it would be a courtesy if
delegations and briefers kept to the allotted time.

I now give the floor to Mr. Swan.
