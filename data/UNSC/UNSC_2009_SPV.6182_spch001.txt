The President: Before we start, I should just like
to recall that many of us were present at this morning's
commemoration of the sixth anniversary of the Canal
Hotel bombing in Baghdad, in which Special
Representative Sergio Vieira de Mello and 21 other
colleagues of ours from the United Nations were killed.
I believe it is appropriate that we bear in mind this
sombre anniversary as a backdrop for our important
work today.

Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.

The situation in the Middle East, including the
Palestinian question

The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council

provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Oscar Fernandez-
Taranco, Assistant Secretary-General for Political
Affairs.

It is so decided.

consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Oscar Fernandez-Taranco, Assistant
