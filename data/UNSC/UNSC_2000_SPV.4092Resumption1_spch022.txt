The President: I thank the representative of
Argentina, and we look forward to turning the gavel over
to him a week from tomorrow - I need some rest.

Several of the speakers inscribed on the list have
already notified us that they would like the presidency of
the Security Council to circulate their statements in
writing. This includes both members of the Security
Council and non-members; we will do so as requested.
We will meet in informal session tomorrow morning to
discuss the presidential statement in draft, at 9 am. Our
goal will be to move as quickly as possible on it. We
welcome the views of all members of the Security
Council and other concerned parties through procedures
that have already been established for individual input.

This has been, obviously, a remarkable day and a
promising day - as the Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity said, a momentous day -
but the proof of the pudding will be in what we can
produce in the way of a presidential statement and,
ultimately, a Security Council resolution to respond to the
statements made and desires expressed so eloquently by
the heads of delegations and Presidents who assembled
here today.

I apologize to those who have not had a chance to
talk today. We will look forward to learning their views
in other forums as quickly as possible, and, if necessary,
we will reconvene.

The meeting was suspended at 5.20 p.m.
