The President (spoke in Chinese): I would like to
inform the Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Belgium and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia in which they request to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation ofthe President, Mr. Mladenovic'
(Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) took a seat at
the Council table; Mr. de Ruyt (Belgium) took the
seat reserved for him at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The President (spoke in Chinese): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

In accordance with the understanding reached in
the Council's prior consultations and in the absence of
objection, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Jean-Marie
Guehenno, Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping
Operations.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Guehenno to take a seat at the
Council table.

The Security Council will hear a briefing by Mr.
Guehenno at this meeting. I understand that he is also
prepared to answer questions or provide clarifications
if need be. At the end of the briefing I will give the
floor to Council members who wish to make comments
or ask questions. I would like to invite members to
raise their hands if they wish to take the floor.

I now give the floor to Mr. Guehenno.
