The President: I thank all the participants for
their contribution to this meeting. My thanks go
particularly to my fellow Vice President, the Secretary-
General, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq and
other representatives.

I would like to close by saying a few final
remarks in my national capacity.

Today was an important milestone for the
Government of Iraq and the people of Iraq in their
ongoing effort to leave behind their troubled past and
embrace a much brighter future. The three resolutions
we adopted bring an end to the burdensome remnants
of the dark era of Saddam Hussein, lifting restrictions
relating to weapons of mass destruction and civilian
nuclear activities and terminating both the oil-for-food
programme and the Development Fund for Iraq.

It is a rare honour, I say to my colleagues, to be
able to preside over this gathering. I thank them all
once more for their efforts in support of this process.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

The meeting rose at 1.35 p.m.
