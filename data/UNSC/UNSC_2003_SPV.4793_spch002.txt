Sir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): I
thank you, Mr. President, for those words. I thank you
for the expression in them of the Council's friendship
with me over five years, and I thank all members for
their part in that. You are all aware - because you are
around this table - what a privilege it is to sit at it.
The United Kingdom sits here more consistently than
the majority, but it is our view that we have to earn that
position of permanence on the Council. My delegation
and I have tried to work with you to demonstrate that,
in its search for results and improvements with regard
to the world's peace and security, we are there to help
you achieve those results, and I hope that I have played
a small part in demonstrating that.

We in the Council - being only 15 among
191 - have to remember that we represent the whole
of the United Nations. The other organs of this great
body expect that of us, and sometimes we respond to
that. But I believe that we can work in this body with
greater responsiveness and transparency to serve the
interest of all Members. I hope that, there again, I have
tried to show that that is an important feature of our
work, because I believe that we are still
underestimating the degree to which we can all serve
our national interests, without exception, around this
table, in the long term, by investing in the collective
potential more consistently on specific issues. As
I move into other business - to which you,
Mr. President, have referred - I shall try to remember
that the strength of this body lies in its collective input
into the international effort to bring peace and security
more consistently to the world.

I thank you all for your friendship and
cooperation over the years, and will remain in touch
with you.
