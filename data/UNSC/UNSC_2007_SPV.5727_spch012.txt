Mr. Kleib (Indonesia): Upon the unanimous
adoption of resolution 1769 (2007), we would like to
express our appreciation for the constructive approach
taken by all delegations in the Security Council,
particularly the sponsors, in addressing our previous
reservations and for the positive approach shown to the
concerns of the delegation of the Sudan in the
formulation of this unprecedented resolution, which,
we believe, has laid the foundation necessary for a
successful outcome.

This resolution is a direct result of the
conclusions reached among the African Union, the
United Nations and the Sudanese Government at the
meeting held in Addis Ababa on 16 November last
year. They agreed that the efforts to help the Sudan and
Darfur would move along three broad fronts: re-
energizing the political process, establishing a
strengthened ceasefire and defining a way forward for
peacekeeping. Therefore, while we have now adopted
this resolution on the hybrid operation, the Security
Council should continue to strongly support the
political process under the stewardship of Special
Envoys Jan Eliasson and Salim Ahmed Salim.
Moreover, efforts should now also be made to
strengthen the ceasefire.

To ensure the successful implementation of this
hybrid operation, it is essential that the African Union
Mission in the Sudan receive all possible support from
the international community - including financial
support and accelerated deployment of the light and
heavy support package - in its implementation of its
mandate.

Finally, the implementation of the resolution that
we have just adopted should be based on a tripartite
partnership among the United Nations, the African
Union and the Sudanese Government. We strongly
believe that it is only through such a partnership that
the endeavours reflected in this resolution can succeed
and ultimately help the people of Darfur.
