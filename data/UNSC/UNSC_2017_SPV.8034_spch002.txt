Mrs. Haley (United States of America): We
called for this meeting tonight knowing that we had
to come away unified. I personally appreciate your
commitment and willingness, Sir, to move quickly.
Once again, all 15 members of the Security Council
have spoken in unison. All of us - the United States,
Japan, China, Russia, Europeans, Africans and South
Americans - we are all together.

And what are we saying? We are all denouncing
North Korea's outrageous act against another United
Nations Member State, Japan. We are all demanding
that North Korea stop any future missile launches.
We are all demanding that North Korea abandon its
nuclear weapons. North Korea has violated every
single Security Council resolution, and it has violated
international law. We are all calling on every nation to
strictly, fully and immediately implement all Security
Council sanctions on North Korea.

The world is united against North Korea. There
is no doubt about that. It is time for the North Korean
regime to recognize the danger it is putting itself in.
The United States will not allow its lawlessness to
continue, and the rest of the world is with us.
