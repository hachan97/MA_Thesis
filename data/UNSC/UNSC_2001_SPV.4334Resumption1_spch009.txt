The President: I thank the representative of
Costa Rica for his kind words addressed to me, to my

Permanent Observer of Palestine to the United Nations,
which will be issued as document S/2001/616, and
which reads as follows:

"I have the honour to request that, in
accordance with its previous practice, the

conflicts .

I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite the Permanent Observer of Palestine to participate
