Mr. Wang Yingfan (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
Chinese delegation would like to thank Assistant Secretary-
General Annabi for his briefing.

There have been some recent positive developments in
East Timor. The transition from the International Force in
East T imor (INTERFET) to the United Nations Transitional
Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) has been smooth.
At the end of last month, President Wahid paid a visit to
East Timor. Progress has been made in the relations
between East Timor and Indonesia as well as other
countries of the region. It should be noted that the situation
in East T imor as a whole remains stable and that
reconstruction, in all its varied aspects, has begun.

We would like also to take this opportunity to express
our appreciation to the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General, Mr. Vieira de Mello, and to all of the
staff of UNTAET for their effective work.

Difficulties persist with respect to reconstruction and
to the maintenance of the current stable situation. Problems
include sabotage activities, the resettlement of returning
refugees, the rehabilitation of the infrastructure, the
restoration of the rule of law and the lack of resources.

It is our hope that all of the parties in East Timor will
maintain a spirit of cooperation and reconciliation so as to
build on the good start they have made with respect to
preserving stability in East Timor. We hope that, with the
support and the assistance of the international community,
the people of East Timor will be able to overcome their
difficulties and reconstruct their homeland. It is also our
hope that all of the parties in East Timor will enhance their
close cooperation with the United Nations so as to ensure
the success of the United Nations peacekeeping operations
there.
