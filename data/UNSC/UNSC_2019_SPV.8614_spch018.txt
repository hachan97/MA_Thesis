Ms. French (United States of America): We would
like to thank Assistant Secretary-General Keita for
her briefing today, and Ambassador Vieira for all
his important work in chairing the Guinea-Bissau
configuration of the Peacebuilding Commission.

The United States is pleased that Guinea-Bissau's
leadership, with the able assistance of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), was
able to agree on a timeline for elections in 2019, and
we welcome the legislative elections that took place in
March. As the focus shifts to the presidential elections
scheduled for 24 November, we must remain faithful
to the consensus agreements that helped create the
country's hard-won, although tenuous, stability. We
look forward to free, fair and transparent elections on
24 November. We welcome the generous contributions
that ECOWAS has made in both financial support and
equipment. We encourage Guinea-Bissau's regional
neighbours and the international community to help
support the Government's efforts to prepare for and
carry out those important elections.

Along with the Secretary-General, we remain
concerned about the continued threat that drug
trafficking and organized crime pose to Guinea-Bissau
and the broader subregion. We applaud the Bissau-
Guinean police's seizure and destruction of two tons
of cocaine in Guinea-Bissau in the past week, and
we welcome the creation of a dedicated unit in the
United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in
Guinea-Bissau for combating drug trafficking and
transnational organized crime. We urge continued
support for strengthening the presence of the United
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in Guinea-Bissau.
