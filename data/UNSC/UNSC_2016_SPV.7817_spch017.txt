Mr. Oyarzun Marchesi (Spain) (spoke in Spanish):
My thanks go, above all, to Stephen and to Elizabeth
for their respective briefings and for their excellent
work. I should like also to thank the Ambassador of
New Zealand, who described very clearly the joint
efforts that Egypt, New Zealand and Spain are making
to ensure the adoption of a series of measures aimed at
halting the fighting in Aleppo so that humanitarian aid
can be distributed inside the city.

Indeed, given the humanitarian disaster depicted
by Stephen O'Brien, no simple message in and of itself
can be enough. We have heard today about deliberate
attacks on doctors and hospitals such as the ones
reported by Me'decins Sans Frontieres this weekend,
which destroyed the last paediatric clinic in eastern
Aleppo. Violations of international humanitarian law
occur daily.

My delegation is not resigned to this situation. We
must do more than just condemn, though it certainly
seems difficult. We support the efforts of the Special
Envoy, who was in Damascus over the weekend seeking
a solution to the most pressing problems facing Syria.
We trust that the Geneva talks will bear fruit. However,
the Security Council must shoulder its responsibility to
halt the country's slide into violence and bring about
a new cessation of hostilities. It is also the Council's
responsibility, as has been said repeatedly, to make a
distinction between terrorists and the opposition.

We are at a turning point in the war in Syria. We
can try to protect the population of Aleppo and restore
the cessation of hostilities across the country, or we can
let the conflict descend into a spiral of violence with
the attendant unpredictable consequences. Spain firmly
supports the first option. As I noted at the outset, we will
continue to work with Egypt and with New Zealand, in
a few minutes' time in the Consultations Room, and
with our other partners in the Security Council to try to
achieve that outcome.
