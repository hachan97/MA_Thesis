Mr. van Walsum (Netherlands): The Amorim panel
issued its report on 30 March, and soon after that my
delegation, together with that of the United Kingdom,
introduced a draft resolution on this matter. Since then,
counter-proposals have been made.

We have been too intimately involved in the process
for us to underestimate the difficulties, but we cannot
conceal the fact that my delegation is far from happy with
the way the Iraq file is being handled in the Security
Council today. While the permanent five have been
struggling with this issue for almost six months, we, the
non-permanent members, have had no more than
approximately one progress report per month, courtesy of
the United Kingdom delegation. It is possible that this
way of functioning, and this speed, are acceptable to the
permanent five, but we, the elected members, simply
cannot go on telling the other United Nations Members,
which elected us, that we are content to sit and wait for
white smoke to emerge from the "H-5" chambers. I use
the expression "H-5" because in my delegation we have
started to call the permanent five "the hereditary five",
which makes a better contrast with the elected ten.

We have been happy to go along with the roll-over
for two weeks, but for two weeks only, because we hope
that this will be a way to keep the pressure on the
permanent five to complete their work on an omnibus
draft resolution on Iraq within that period.
