Mr. Gusmao: On behalf of the people of East
Timor, we would like to thank the members for their
advice, recommendations and words of congratulations
offered in their interventions.

I repeat to the members that our success is, and
will be, their success. We will continue to rely heavily
on the Council's support, and we assure it that in
everything we are committed to doing our best in
building the democratic State of East Timor. I thank the
members of the Council very much for their support
and kind words. Again, we will work together.
