The President: I thank the Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity for the kind words he
addressed to my Government.

The next speaker is the representative of Algeria, who
wishes to make a statement on behalf of the current
Chairman of the Organization of African Unity. I invite him
to take a seat at the Council table and to make his
statement.
