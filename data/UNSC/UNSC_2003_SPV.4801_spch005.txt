Mr. Khalid (Pakistan): Our position on the
question of Western Sahara is well known. Pakistan
attaches great importance to this issue and its early
resolution, involving, as it does, countries with which
Pakistan enjoys traditionally close and fraternal
relations.

The Western Sahara issue has long been on the
agenda of the Security Council and hinges on the
principle of self-determination, which is an integral
part of the Charter of the United Nations. Pakistan
appreciates the continued engagement of the Secretary-
General and the significant role played by his Envoy,
Mr. James Baker, in pursuit of a political solution to
the dispute over Western Sahara which provides for the
realization of the right to self-determination.

The peace plan could provide a basis to facilitate
the early solution of this issue on the basis of
agreement between the two parties. Pakistan supports a
negotiated peaceful settlement, in accordance with the
relevant Security Council resolutions. Pakistan has
consistently held that all resolutions of the Security
Council, whether under Chapter VI or Chapter VII,
should be implemented.

Pakistan has all along supported the efforts aimed
at finding a common ground, with a View to bringing
the parties closer to a solution. We therefore appreciate
the constructive efforts made by the members of the
Council to evolve an acceptable text. We are glad that
the Council has been able to move forward in a unified
way.

Pakistan has joined this consensus in the hope
that this resolution represents a step forward in the
direction of a peaceful settlement of this longstanding
dispute.
