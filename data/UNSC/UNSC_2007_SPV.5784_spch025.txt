Mr. Guehenno: There was only one real question
that was raised, which was on the delays in the
deployment of the heavy support package. The delays
in the heavy support package are quite revealing of the
broader issues that we face in the overall deployment
of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation
in Darfur (UNAMID), of which, in a way, the heavy
support package is just one early phase. There is not
one single explanation for those delays; there is a
combination of explanations.

First, in some cases, capacities that were
announced by troop contributors, upon verification by
the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, were
actually not available or were not the ones that had
been requested.

A second aspect is the hesitation sometimes of
troop contributors themselves, as they delay the load
list, as we call it, that is, a document that we need to
organize logistics. They sometimes seem to hesitate
about when to deploy.

A third set of issues has been the kind of issues
that have been mentioned with regard to UNAMID in
terms of cooperation with the Government of the
07-61468

Sudan, which sometimes has been there and sometimes
has not. I am thinking of delays in giving visas for
reconnaissance missions that need to happen, delays in
providing the land for the units to deploy.

It is all of those factors that end up delaying
significantly the deployment of the heavy support
package. Our concern is that the repetition of such
problems and then their amplification, as described in
the briefing today, could seriously delay or hamper the
UNAMID mission itself.
