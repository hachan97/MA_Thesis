The President: I thank the Prime Minister of the
Republic of Haiti for his important statement. I take
this opportunity to express, on behalf of the Security
Council, our appreciation to the Prime Minister of the
Republic of Haiti for coming to address the Council.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. In accordance with the understanding reached
earlier, I should now like to invite Council members to
informal consultations following the adjournment of
this meeting.

The meeting rose at 3.45 p.m.
