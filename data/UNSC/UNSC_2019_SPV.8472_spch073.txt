Mr. Arreaza (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): I apologize for taking the floor again.
All Venezuelans are dependent on the situation and
conditions in our country. Some 6 million Colombians
live in Venezuela. We welcome and appreciate them.
Last year, we received almost 100,000 Colombians,
who came because of the conditions in their country,
with which we are all familiar. We have Ecuadorians
and Peruvians in our country. There are almost a
million of them. They are welcome and we want them
in our country.

We have sent many diplomatic notes to the Foreign
Ministries of those countries that claim to be receiving
Venezuelans, asking them for precise information on
the numbers, because the figure of 3 million refugees
is absolutely absurd. It does not correspond to reality,
although there is heavy migration. How could there
not be emigration in a country that has been subject
over the past four years to an economic blockade that
is designed to make the people suffer? The United
States has admitted that its intention is to strangle the
Venezuelan people in order to spark regime change.

The Peruvian Government recently decided not to

recognize our diplomatic personnel, who are entrusted
with protecting the community of Venezuelans in Peru.
That decision seems to be contradictory, but I would
ask for a demonstration of good faith so that our Foreign
Ministry can work with Peru, Chile and Ecuador to
gather the information we need, including names and
locations, so that we can fully address the needs of the
Venezuelan groups that have left our country.
