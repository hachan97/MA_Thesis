Mr. Denisov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): At the outset, I wish to welcome President
Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the first woman in Liberia to
assume such a senior post following free and
democratic elections.

The Government of National Unity has achieved
truly significant success in strengthening the country's
unity and overcoming the consequences of the lengthy
conflict there. However, much remains to be done to
ensure the irreversibility of achievements in the peace
process, to rebuild the war-torn and shattered country,
to reconstruct the economy and infrastructure, and to
restore and consolidate legitimacy, law and order.

Without effective assistance on the part of the
international community, including the donor countries
and the development partners, and without the firm
political support of the Security Council, it will be
extremely difficult to resolve those issues, although the
fate of the country is naturally in the hands of the
Liberians themselves.

In conclusion, I should like to express our full
support for the efforts of the new Government of
Liberia and for Mrs. Johnson-Sirleaf personally. We are
certain that, in the near future, life in Liberia will
return to normal and that the country will embark on
the path of sustainable development and prosperity.
