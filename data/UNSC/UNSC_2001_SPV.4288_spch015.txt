The President: I thank the representative of
Egypt for his statement. Indeed, he made a number of
very practical and action-oriented remarks that must be
taken into account in the future work of the Council.

I would like to note, inter alia, his important
comments with regard to the mechanism of
consultations with troop-contributing countries. As a
matter of fact, those comments are very similar to what
was said earlier by the representative of Canada. It will
be very important for the Council to take these
comments into account, in view of the ongoing work in
the Council Working Group on peacekeeping
operations.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Australia. I invite her to take a seat at
the Council table and to make her statement.
