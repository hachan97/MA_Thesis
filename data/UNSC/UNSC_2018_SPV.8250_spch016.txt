Mr. Zhang Dianbin (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
Wish to thank Ms. Bensouda for her briefing.

China is deeply concerned at the developments in
Libya and supports all efforts conducive to stabilizing
the situation there, promoting a political settlement of
the Libyan issue and combating terrorism. We support
the United Nations in its efforts to continue to advance
the relevant plan of action and increase the use of its
good offices. China firmly supports the Libyan people
in the maintenance of national accord and unity. We
hope that the Libyan parties will remain committed
to the political settlement process, which is Libyan-
led and -owned, engage in inclusive dialogue so as to
move towards one another, resolve their differences and
strengthen mutual trust through negotiations so as to
find a settlement that accommodates the interests of
all parties.

The advancement of national reconciliation, the
restoration of State governance and the early realization
of peace, stability and development in Libya constitute
a prerequisite and the foundation for the realization of
justice in Libya. The international community must
continue to respect the unity, sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Libya and continue to provide various forms
of support and assistance to the country.

China's position regarding the International
Criminal Court remains unchanged.
