The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Bolivia, Liechtenstein, Malawi,
Morocco, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Senegal,
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Tunisia,
Venezuela, Zambia and Zimbabwe, in which they
request to be invited to participate in the discussion of
the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with
the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the
Council, to invite those representatives to participate in
the discussion Without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Ortiz
Gandarillas (Bolivia), Mr. Wenaweser
(Liechtenstein), Mr. Lamba (Malawi), Mr.
Bennouna (Morocco), Mr. Morales (Panama), Mr.
Aisi (Papua New Guinea), Mr. de Rivero (Peru),
Mr. Fall (Senegal), Mr. Nikolov (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), Mr. Hachani
(Tunisia), Mr. Alcalay (Venezuela), Mr.
Musamnbachime (Zambia) and Mr. Chidyausiku
(Zimbabwe) took the seats reserved for them at
the side of the Council Chamber.

The President (spoke in French): Before opening
the floor, I reiterate my request to all participants to
limit their statements to no more than seven minutes in
order to enable the Council to work efficiently within
its timetable.

I thank representatives for their understanding
and cooperation.

As another measure to optimize the use of our
time, in order to allow as many delegations to take the
floor as possible, I will not individually invite speakers
to take seats at the table or invite them to resume their
seats at the side. When a speaker is taking the floor, the
Conference Officer will seat the next speaker on the
list at the table.

I give the floor to the representative of Japan.
