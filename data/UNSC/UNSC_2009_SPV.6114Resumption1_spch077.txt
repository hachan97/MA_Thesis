The President (spoke in Spanish): After
consultations among members of the Security Council,
I have been authorized to make the following statement
on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council takes note with
appreciation of the eighth report of the Secretary-
General (S/2009/ 158) on children and armed
conflict and of the positive developments referred
to in the report, and notes the continuing
challenges in the implementation of its resolution
1612 (2005) reflected therein.

"The Security Council reaffirms its
commitment to address the widespread impact of
armed conflict on children, and its determination
to ensure respect for, and the implementation of,
its resolution 1612 (2005) and all its previous
resolutions on children and armed conflict, as
well as respect for other applicable international
law related to the protection of children affected
by armed conflict.

"The Security Council stresses, in this
regard, the importance of adopting a broad
strategy of conflict prevention, which addresses
the root causes of armed conflict in a
comprehensive manner in order to enhance the
protection of children on a long-term basis,
including by promoting sustainable development,
poverty eradication, national reconciliation, good
governance, democracy, the rule of law and
respect for and protection of human rights.

"The Security Council acknowledges that
the implementation of its resolution 1612 (2005)
in situations listed in the annexes to the
Secretary-General's report (S/2009/158) has
generated progress and invites the Secretary-
General, where applicable, to strengthen the
efforts to bring the monitoring and reporting
mechanism to its full capacity in order to allow
for prompt advocacy and effective response to all
violations and abuses committed against children.
In this regard, the Council reiterates its request to
the Secretary-General to provide additional
administrative support to its Working Group on
Children and Armed Conflict.
"The Security Council reiterates its equally
strong condemnation of the continuing
recruitment and use of children in armed conflict
in violation of applicable international law,
killing and maiming of children, rape and other
sexual violence, abductions, denial of
humanitarian access to children and attacks
against schools and hospitals by parties to armed
conflict. The Council condemns all other
violations of international law, including
international humanitarian law, human rights law
and refugee law, committed against children in
situations of armed conflict. The Council
demands that all relevant parties immediately put
an end to such practices and take special
measures to protect children.

"The Security Council expresses deep
concern that civilians, in particular children,
continue to account for a considerable number of
casualties resulting from killing and maiming in
armed conflicts, including as a result of deliberate
targeting, indiscriminate and excessive use of
force, indiscriminate use of landmines and cluster
munitions and use of children as human shields.

"The Security Council further expresses
deep concern with the high incidence and
appalling levels of brutality, of rape and other
forms of sexual violence against children, girls
and boys, committed in the context of and
associated with armed conflict, including the use
or commission of rape and other forms of sexual
violence in some situations as a tactic of war.

"The Security Council recognizes the
importance of including in the annexes to the
Secretary-General's reports on children and
armed conflict those parties to armed conflict that
commit acts of killing and maiming of children
that are prohibited under applicable international
law or acts of rape and other sexual violence
against children that are prohibited under
applicable international law, in situations of
armed conflict, and expresses its intention to
continue its consideration of this issue, in order to
take action within three months of this date.

"The Security Council reiterates its call on
parties to armed conflict listed in the annexes of
the Secretary General's report (S/2009/158) that

have not already done so to prepare and
implement, without further delay, concrete time-
bound action plans to halt recruitment and use of
children in violation of applicable international
law, and to address all other violations and abuses
committed against children and undertake
specific commitments and measures in this
regard, in close cooperation with the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General for
Children and Armed Conflict and the United
Nations country-level task forces on monitoring
and reporting.

"The Security Council expresses its concern
with situations where insufficient or no progress
has been made by parties listed in the annexes to
the Secretary-General's reports in halting
recruitment and use of children in violation of
applicable international law, including through
the preparation and implementation of concrete
time-bound action plans, and reiterates its
determination to ensure respect for its resolutions
on children and armed conflict, making use of all
the tools provided in its resolution 1612 (2005),
including action as appropriate in accordance
with paragraph 9 of its resolution 1612 (2005).

"The Security Council strongly emphasizes
the need for concerned Member States to take
decisive and immediate action against persistent
perpetrators of violations against children, and to
46

bring to justice those responsible for the
recruitment and use of children in violation of
applicable international law and other violations
against children through national justice systems
and, where applicable, international justice
mechanisms and mixed criminal courts and
tribunals, with a view to ending impunity for
those committing crimes against children.

"The Security Council reiterates the primary
responsibility of States in providing effective
protection and relief to all children affected by
armed conflicts, and calls upon them to comply
with their obligations under applicable
international law, including the Convention on
the Rights of the Child and the Optional
Protocols thereto, and encourages States to
strengthen national measures for the prevention
of violations against children in armed conflict,
including recruitment and use of children and
their use in hostilities in violation of applicable
international law, inter alia, by enacting

legislation that explicitly prohibits such

recruitment and use as well as other violations,
and urges States that have not yet done so to
consider ratifying or acceding to this Convention
and its Optional Protocols.

"The Security Council reiterates the
importance of the full, safe and unhindered
access of humanitarian personnel and goods and
the delivery of humanitarian assistance to all
children affected by armed conflict, and stresses
the importance for all, within the framework of
humanitarian assistance, of upholding and
respecting the humanitarian principles of
humanity, neutrality, impartiality and
independence.

"The Security Council remains concerned
with the illicit trafficking of small arms and light
weapons and its effect on and their use by
children in armed conflict.

"The Security Council welcomes the
sustained engagement of its Working Group on
Children and Armed Conflict and requests it to
adopt, with the administrative support of the
Secretariat, timely conclusions and
recommendations in line with resolution 1612
(2005). The Council encourages its Working
Group to continue its review process, to enhance
its ability to follow up the implementation of its
recommendations and the development and
implementation of action plans to halt
recruitment and use of children, and to consider
and react in a timely manner to information on
situations of children and armed conflict, in
collaboration with the Office of the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General and
UNICEF. It also invites its Working Group to
enhance its communication with relevant Security
Council sanctions committees, including by
forwarding pertinent information.

"The Security Council commends the work
carried out by the Special Representative of the
Secretary General for Children and Armed
Conflict, Ms. Radhika Coomaraswamy, and
emphasizes the importance of her country visits
in promoting collaboration between the United
Nations and Governments and enhancing
dialogue with parties to armed conflict.
"The Security Council also commends the
work carried out by UNICEF as well as other
relevant United Nations agencies, funds and
programmes, within their respective mandates,
the child protection advisers of United Nations
peacekeeping, peacebuilding and political
missions in cooperation with national
Governments and relevant civil society actors.

"The Security Council encourages the
efforts of the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations in mainstreaming child protection into
all peacekeeping missions, in close collaboration
with the Office of the Special Representative of
the Secretary-General for Children and Armed
Conflict and UNICEF, and encourages the
deployment of child protection advisers to
peacekeeping operations, as well as into relevant
peacebuilding and political missions.

"The Security Council invites the
Peacebuilding Commission to continue to
promote child protection in post-conflict
situations under its consideration.

"Given the regional dimension of some
conflicts, the Security Council encourages
Member States, United Nations peacekeeping,
peacebuilding and political missions and United
Nations country teams to establish appropriate
strategies and coordination mechanisms for
information exchange and cooperation on cross-
border child protection concerns such as
recruitment, release and reintegration of children.
"The Security Council recognizes the
important role of education in armed conflict
areas, including as a means to achieve the goal of
halting and preventing recruitment and re-
recruitment of children in violation of applicable
international law, and calls upon all parties
concerned to continue to ensure that all children
associated with armed forces and groups
systematically have access to disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration processes where
they can benefit, inter alia, from education.

"The Security Council also urges parties to
armed conflict to refrain from actions that impede
children's access to education, in particular
attacks or threats of attack on school children or
teachers as such, the use of schools for military
operations, and attacks on schools that are
prohibited by applicable international law.

"The Security Council requests the
Secretary-General to submit his next report by
May 2010 on the implementation of its
resolutions on children and armed conflict."

This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2009/9.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 7.50 pm.
