Mr. Shen Bo (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
voted in favour ofresolution 2337 (2017). China has been
following the developments in The Gambia since its
presidential elections. We call on the parties concerned
in the country to remain calm, to put the interests of
the country and of the people first and to resolve the
ongoing political crisis appropriately, through dialogue
and political consultation, in order to maintain peace
and stability in The Gambia.

China has been consistently supportive of
Africans settling African issues in the African way,
and commends the positive efforts of regional and
subregional organizations, such as the African Union
and the Economic Community of West African States,
to help address Gambian issues through good offices
and mediation. China supports the countries and
organizations concerned in their efforts to bring their
respective influence to bear; to step up good offices
and mediation efforts; and to continue to encourage
the parties to move towards a proper solution of the
Gambian issue, and thereby contributing to regional
peace and stability.
