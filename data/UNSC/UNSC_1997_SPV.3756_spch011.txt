Mr. Liden (Sweden): In our statement to the
Security Council on 5 March, Sweden expressed deep
concern about Israeli Government decisions and plans for
settlements on occupied territory. The most recent
decision concerns Jabal Abu Ghneim/Har Homa, located
on the occupied West Bank in the Jerusalem area.

We worked hard to see our concern - which I
believe to be the concern of all of us - expressed in a
Security Council resolution supported by all. Regrettably,
the Council failed to agree.

Over the past few days, Sweden has been actively
engaged in trying to reach agreement on a presidential
statement. Again, I cannot but strongly regret that no
agreement was achieved in the Council. Only when the
Security Council agrees to speak with one voice can it
send a clear message and make its influence felt and
understood by the parties directly involved.

Sweden voted in favour of the draft resolution before
us. We fully support its contents.

The Foreign Minister of Sweden, Mrs. Lena Hjelm-
Wallen, deplored in a statement on 19 March that
construction had commenced on the Jabal Abu Ghneim
hill. She called upon the Israeli Government to abandon
its settlement policy.

This morning, the Foreign Minister strongly
condemned the terrorist attack in central Tel Aviv. She
urged restraint in order to prevent an escalation of the
violence.

In conclusion, I will repeat the words of my Foreign
Minister: the only way forward is to return to the peace
process.
