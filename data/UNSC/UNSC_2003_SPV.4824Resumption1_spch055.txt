Mr. Gillerman (Israel): I must say that I am very
saddened - and I say that even with a tinge of pity -
at the pathetic remarks of the Palestinian
representative. Unfortunately, I will be unable to meet
him at his level, because the descent would be too
abrupt. He has proved once again that he represents the
dark past of the Palestinians rather than the bright
future they truly deserve.

As to the claim that Yasser Arafat is a legitimate
leader, let me remind the Council that the Palestinians
thought that Saddam Hussain was a legitimate leader,
along with many other people whom history has chosen
to remove from the stage.

The mere fact that the Palestinian representative
has felt the need to refer to very dubious events and
inventions that happened 50, 60 or 70 years ago proves
the very poor case and the very blatant demagoguery
that I prefer not to answer.
