The President: I thank Mr. Vieira de Mello for
his kind words addressed to me and my country.

I shall now call on Mr. Mark Malloch Brown,
Administrator of the United Nations Development
Programme, to whom the Council has extended an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure. I invite him to take a seat at the Council
table and to make his statement.
