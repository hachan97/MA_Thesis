Mr. Gombo (Chad) (spoke in French): I would
like to thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his
readiness to give a briefing to the Council on the urgent
situation in Ukraine.

Chad would like to express its serious concern
with regard to the rapid deterioration of the situation
in Ukraine, in particular in the Donetsk region. The
meeting of the two Heads of State - Mr. Poroshenko
and Mr. Putin - on Tuesday, 26 August in Minsk
is, in our View, a new step towards de-escalating the
tension. However, only two days later, reports indicate
an intensification of the fighting in the Luhansk and
Donetsk regions and the presence of 1,000 Russian
volunteers who are supposedly fighting in the Ukrainian
territory alongside pro-Russian separatists. The new
escalation is a cause of concern for Chad.

As we have repeated many times, the solution
to the crisis in Ukraine must be political and should
be reached through an inclusive, direct dialogue on
the basis of respect for the territorial integrity and
sovereignty of Ukraine in accordance with the Charter
of the United Nations.
