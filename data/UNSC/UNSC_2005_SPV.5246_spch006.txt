Sir Emyr Jones Parry (United Kingdom): I, too,
would like to join colleagues in welcoming Mr. Bolton.
The United Kingdom looks forward to working very
closely with him.

The United Kingdom welcomes today's
resolution. It is right that the Council should condemn
without reservation and in the strongest terms the
recent terrorist attacks that have taken place in Iraq.
Those attacks and attacks before them, targeting and
killing hundreds, truly have been shameless and
horrific.

The resolution we have adopted again urges every
United Nations Member State to prevent the transit,
arming, support and financing of terrorists, and it again
notes the importance of the role of countries in the
region - and in particular Iraq's neighbours - in that
respect. Syria and Iran, in particular, can and should do
more. Nothing can justify any country's turning and
blind eye to those acts of mass murder. Nothing can
justify supporting those callous terrorists.

Despite those attacks, many courageous Iraqis
continue to take forward the peaceful political process
and the drafting of a new constitution as they work
towards constitutionally mandated elections inclusive
of all. The international community should and, I
know, will stand by them in those efforts, encouraging
national dialogue, outreach and a political process in
which all Iraqis can participate peacefully. For our part,
we must do everything possible to support that process
and the recently confirmed timetable for that
constitutional development.
