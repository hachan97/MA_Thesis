Mr. Buallay (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): Our
delegation regrets the recent developments in Kosovo,
which have finally led to the use of military force against
the forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. We have
long called for a peaceful settlement of the Kosovo crisis
through serious and constructive dialogue between the
parties to the conflict.

However, the authorities in Belgrade unfortunately
insisted on their position and did not seize the opportunity
afforded them in Rambouillet. Those authorities insisted on
pursuing a policy of repression against the Kosovar
Albanian community, a policy that started when those
authorities put an end to the autonomy enjoyed by Kosovo
until 1989. It would seem as if they have quickly forgotten
or disregarded the lessons drawn from the tragic experience
of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

It would also seem that the authorities in Belgrade do
not want the Balkan region to enjoy the peace and stability
so sorely missed by the peoples of the region. The policy
of "ethnic cleansing" and the denial of the fundamental
rights of the Kosovar Albanians can bring only destruction
and instability to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Such
a policy has also led to the displacement of thousands of
Kosovo inhabitants. There are more than 200,000 displaced
persons within Kosovo, in addition to the thousands of
others who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries.
The problem has indeed become extremely serious, and a
humanitarian catastrophe is looming.

Our delegation hopes that the authorities in Belgrade
will come to their senses and obey the dictates of reason
and logic with a view to achieving peace and stability in
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and in the Balkan
region in general. This can become reality only if they
enter into a serious and constructive dialogue and commit
to all relevant Security Council resolutions and to
cooperation with the international community in order to
put an end to the conflict in Kosovo.
