The President: I thank Minister Queta for his
statement.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. In accordance with the understanding reached in
the Council's prior consultations, I now invite
members to informal consultations to continue our
discussion on the subject.

The meeting rose at 10.50 am.
