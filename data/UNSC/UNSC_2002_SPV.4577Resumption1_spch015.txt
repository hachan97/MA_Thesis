The President: Thank you for those comments
and for setting out the role of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) as you
see it.

You described a role that sounds very resource-
intensive, and that I am sure is resource intensive in
terms of being able to work with the different
countries to not only bring about peace but to try to
consolidate peace. Does ECOWAS have the financial
and institutional capacity to meet subregional
requirements? If not, are there proposals or plans for
expansion?
