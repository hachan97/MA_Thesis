The President: There are no more names inscribed
on the list of speakers. Again, I especially thank
Foreign Minister Al-Qirbi, Secretary General Al
Zayani, Special Adviser Benomar and all other high-
level participants for their participation this afternoon.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 5.20pm.
