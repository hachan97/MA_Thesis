Mr. Vitrenko (Ukraine): With reference to the
statement made by the Russian delegation, let me just
recall a simple but rock-solid and undeniable fact.

The Russian Federation is recognized by the
General Assembly as an occupying Power in Ukraine
and by extension as a party to an international conflict.
As the occupying Power and a party to a conflict or
dispute, that country does not have the legal right, and
especially not the moral right, to pronounce itself on
Ukraine in the Council by virtue of the United Nations
Charter, at least not until Russia returns Crimea to
Ukraine, withdraws from the eastern part of my country
and pays in full for the damage inflicted by its invasion.
