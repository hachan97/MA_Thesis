Mr. Ipo (Cote d'Ivoire) (spoke in French): My
delegation thanks Mr. Martin Griffiths, Mr. Mark
Lowcock, Mr. David Beasley and Ms. Rasha Jarum for
their informative briefings on the latest developments
in the political and humanitarian situations in Yemen.

After four years of fighting in Yemen, the civilian
population is now facing a true humanitarian tragedy.
Millions of Yemenis are living under the threat of food
insecurity and are prey to famine and malnutrition,
while civilians with no access to safe drinking water
and basic or emergency health care are dealing with
waterborne diseases and the risk of epidemics. In
that regard, Cote d'Ivoire reiterates its deep concern
about the intensified fighting, as a result of which the
humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate. We
welcome and encourage the efforts of United Nations
bodies and agencies to bring an end to the deadly
clashes and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian
assistance and emergency relief.

In view of this deplorable and disturbing situation,
we reaffirm our support for all the international
community's initiatives to resolve the crisis in Yemen.
In that regard, we call on all the parties to the conflict
to participate in the consultations soon to be held in
Stockholm, led by Special Envoy Griffiths, to whom we
affirm our full support. In that regard, my country calls
on the opposing parties to observe the ceasefire in the
port city of Al-Hudaydah, the epicentre of the crisis, to
allow both for the delivery of humanitarian assistance
and for giving peace a chance. We also urge all the
Yemeni parties to fully engage in frank negotiations
and make the compromises needed to achieve a lasting
settlement to the crisis within the framework of the
parameters established by the Security Council.

In conclusion, Cote d'Ivoire calls for united action
by the Council with a view to reaching a peaceful and
definitive settlement to the conflict as soon as possible
and in the interests of the people.
