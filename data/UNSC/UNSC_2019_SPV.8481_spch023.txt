Mr. Yamamoto: I thank you, Madam, for the
opportunity to supplement the briefing I made earlier.
I would like to talk about Afghanistan's central role in
the peace process.

The peace process is about determining the future
of the country and its people. Therefore, the centrality
of Afghanistan in the peace process is imperative and
the process must be owned by its people, including
women. It is necessary that substantive talks on peace
take place between the Government, representing
a cross-section of the population, and the Taliban.
Inclusiveness, coherence and representativeness in
negotiations are critical to success.

We understand that the Government is consulting
widely to forge the negotiating structure, including a
negotiating team, that will enable such inclusiveness
with coherence. The establishment of such a negotiating
team will be critical to moving the process of peace
further along. We have learned that a presidential decree
was issued yesterday for the holding of a consultative
peace jirga - a traditional assembly of leaders - in
late April. We hope that this will help create a national
consensus on peace through an inclusive process.
