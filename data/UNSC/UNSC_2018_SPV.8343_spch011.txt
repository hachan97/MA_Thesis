Mr. Umarov (Kazakhstan): Having heard
today's update on the current situation surrounding
the investigation into this well-known incident, my
delegation would also like to share its observations on
the topic.

First, we appreciate the diligent work of the United
Kingdom on the case and the fact that it shared its
information with us. However, reviewing such a serious
matter requires additional time, in particular to study
the findings of the British investigation.

Secondly, it is difficult to arrive at an objective
assessment, especially with regard to the conclusions
based on the United Kingdom letter of5 September. We
would appreciate receiving more concrete data before
drawing any conclusions.

Thirdly, while actions should always be taken,
decisions should not be made in haste. As we can
see, with time, we will receive increasingly specific
information pertaining to the incident, which will
eventually enable us to make a fair and objective
assessment and conclusion.

As a country that has been affected by the
consequences ofthe use ofweapons ofmass destruction,
we express our sincere solidarity with those who have
suffered and are suffering from such weapons today. We
remain firmly committed to the fight against the use of
chemical weapons and are ready to play a constructive
role in preventing such atrocious incidents.

Kazakhstan counts on the continuation of
comprehensive, objective and transparent investigations
and calls on the parties not act hastily without providing
full and irrefutable evidence of the involvement of one
side or the other.

Lastly, we think that the Council, as the main
body for ensuring international peace and security,
should remain consistent in acting on solid facts,
based on evidence, in order to make objective and
transparent decisions.
