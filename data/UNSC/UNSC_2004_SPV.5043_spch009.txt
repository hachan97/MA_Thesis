President Obasanjo: In response to the question

about what the Security Council should be doing that it
is not doing, I would say that it is doing a lot. There is
a proverb in my part of the world concerning lice. They
may be in your clothes, in your bed - everywhere.
Lice do not die easily. So when you find one, you have
to put it on your fingernail and press it with another
fingernail to kill it. And when you have done so, you
see a little blood on your fingernail. The saying is that,
as long as you have lice in your clothes, your
fingernails will never be free of blood. We have lice in
our clothes in Darfur, and therefore there will always
be blood on our fingernails. Until we get rid of the lice,
our fingernails will not be without blood.

That is what I would say: until we are able,
together, to resolve the problem of Darfur, we will
never be able to say we have done enough - we will
never be able to say, "Yes, here is uhura, here is
freedom".

But I would say, yes, we are doing a great deal of
what we need to do. I would also say, here and now,
that, with all due respect, the five permanent members
of the Council should really work together. A situation
in which it appears that one country is supporting the
rebels - they call themselves "resistance fighters" -
and another country is seen as supporting the
Government of Sudan does not provide uniform
backing for putting uniform pressure on the two sides,
the Government and the rebels. And we need to do
that.

Of course, as I have said very often, there will be
a need for adequate logistic backing for what the
African Union has to do in Darfur.
