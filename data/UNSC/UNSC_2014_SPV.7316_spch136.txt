The President: There are no more names inscribed
on the list of speakers. We have had a very long
day, with almost 70 Member States speaking. Self-
evidently, that is in itself a measure of how dangerous
and decisive the threat of terrorism is globally. I thank
all who participated.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 6.20pm.
