Mr. Alotaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I will
be brief. I would have preferred not to respond to the
statement by the representative of Israel. Israel is a State
Member of the United Nations, and when it became a
member it pledged to respect the Charter of the United
Nations. Article 25 ofthe Charter states that the Members
of the United Nations agree to accept and carry out the
decisions of the Security Council. I must therefore ask
why Israel does not abide by its commitments. Why
does it not implement the Council's resolutions that it is
committed to? Why does it not uphold international law
and its pledges pursuant to the Geneva Conventions and
other international conventions?
With regard to what the representative of Israel said
about what he called the events of 1990, I would prefer
not to comment because they have no basis in fact.
They also have nothing to do with the subject under
discussion today.
