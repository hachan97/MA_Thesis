Mr. Fernandes (Brazil): I thank the Permanent
Representative of Colombia for his briefing on the
activities of the Security Council Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1737 (2006). I assure
the Council that my delegation will continue to do its
utmost to support the work of the Committee. Last
year, following its adoption by the Council, the
provisions of resolution 1929 (2010) were incorporated

11-3854]
into Brazilian domestic legislation. They are now in
force in Brazil.

The Panel of Experts was created to carry out a
number of tasks under the direction of the Committee.
We expect that the work of the Panel will strictly
conform to its mandate, as clearly defined in resolution
1929 (2010).

We took note of the Panel's final report and its
recommendations. It is our understanding that the
conclusions and recommendations of the Panel must be
fact-based and, as a rule, be firmly grounded on
credible evidence. We agree with the Experts that the
challenge for Member States is to ensure the full
implementation of the targeted sanctions, while at the
same time enabling legitimate trade and other activities
not covered by sanctions to continue unhindered.

I wish to take this opportunity to confirm the
Brazilian invitation for the Panel of Experts to visit
Brazil during the second half of this year.

From a broader perspective, as regards
negotiations on the Iranian nuclear issue, we regret that
the continued lack of mutual trust has blocked progress
on the talks. The prompt resumption of dialogue would
be beneficial to addressing the concerns of the
international community in order to clarify outstanding
questions and ensure that the Iranian nuclear
programme is entirely peaceful.
