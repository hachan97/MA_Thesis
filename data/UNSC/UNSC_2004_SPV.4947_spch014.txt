Ms. Menendez (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): Spain
voted in favour of the draft resolution contained in
document S/2004/313 because we fully agree with its
contents. Moreover, as other speakers have said, that is
true of the entire Council. The draft resolution was not
adopted, but we hope it will be adopted next week in
conformity with appendix E of the Secretary-General's
plan. That would mean that the 24 April referendums
on the island will have had a positive outcome. Spain
wants a reunified Cyprus to join the European Union
on 1 May. Finally, I reaffirm my delegation's support
for the efforts made by the Secretary-General.
