Mr. Ndong Mba (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in Spanish): I once again express the frustration of our
delegation over this afternoon's negative outcome. We
abstained in the voting on the third draft resolution
(S/2018/322), first of all because it was submitted only
very late today and, secondly, because it is lacking
compared to the two previous draft resolutions on
which we voted in favour (S/2018/175 and S/2018/321).
We believe that we should ask the representative of
Sweden, Mr. Olof Skoog, not to withdraw his proposal
so that following this meeting - perhaps tomorrow
afternoon - as was suggested during consultations,
we can continue considering and analysing it to see
whether we can agree to vote on the draft resolution
once we have introduced amendments and reached a
consensus on the text that he has presented.
