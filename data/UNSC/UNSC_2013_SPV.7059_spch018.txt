The President (spoke in Chinese): I shall now make
a statement in my capacity as the representative of
China.

I thank Ms. Bensouda for her briefing.
With the efforts by the Government of Libya, the
political transition process in Libya has continued to
make progress. We support Libya in continuing to
advance the political transition, and we hope that all
parties in Libya will attach importance to the interests
of the country and the people, maintain national
unity, commit themselves to resolving differences
through dialogue and properly meet all the challenges
in the political transition so as to achieve national
reconciliation and accelerate national reconstruction
and development. China welcomes the efforts made
by the Government of Libya to achieve justice through
the judiciary. China's position on international judicial
bodies remains unchanged.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Lybia.
