Ms. Meitzad (Israel): The Islamic State of
Iran, which openly supports and sponsors terrorism
throughout the region, had the audacity to sit here in
the Chamber and spread lies. Besides its perpetration
of the long list of criminal and terrorist acts attributed
to it, Iran does not spare the lives even of its own young
people, since it remains one of the few States in the
world that execute juvenile offenders. Considering
Iran's utter disregard for human life, it comes as no
surprise that it continues to commit unspeakable acts
such as assisting the Al-Assad regime in the ruthless
slaughter of the Syrian people, directly and through its
proxy Hizbullah.

I could not agree more with the Ambassador
of Lebanon's statement about how impossible it is
to maintain peace and security if States are not held
responsible for their internationally wrongful acts. I
believe that, in his case, self-awareness is operating,
coming as it does from a representative of a State in
which Hizbullah, which has been designated a terrorist
organization, has the honour of being represented in
Parliament and the Government.

I now turn to the comments by my colleague from
Bolivia. Bolivia's one-sided, biased and unrelenting
attack on Israel is an example of what makes the
Security Council incapable of being more effective.
One might expect that a country that hadjustjoined the
Security Council would appreciate the responsibilities
that such a task entails and would make an effort to try
to understand the complexities of a situation. But for
Bolivia, as for one ofits immediate predecessors on the
Council, Venezuela, a seat on the Council is to be used
to brutally attack my country, and thereby severely
damage the credibility of this institution.

The meeting rose at 3.10pm.
