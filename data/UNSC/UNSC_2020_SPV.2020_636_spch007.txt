Ican be brief. On substance, I rally behind what my European Union colleague, the Permanent Representative of Estonia, said a moment ago. Having heard the debate so far, we can see that there is a lot of unity in the Security Council on this matter. I think such unity is very important, as it sends a strong signal of support for an early conclusion of the negotiations among the stakeholders. We count on Egypt, Ethiopia and the Sudan - whose representatives I would like to welcome to the Council, namely, Foreign Minister Selim and my brothers from the Sudan and Ethiopia - to find a solution balancing their interests. Germany is committed to continuing its technical support for this process. We hope that these negotiations will come to an early and amicable result.
