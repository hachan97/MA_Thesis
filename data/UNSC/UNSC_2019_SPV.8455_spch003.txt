Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): My colleagues thanked you during the
consultations, Mr. President, while I reserved for myself
the privilege of doing so in an open format. But of
course I was upstaged by my friend the representative of
France, who in his usual gallant manner congratulated
you twice.

However, I want to congratulate you not on the
conclusion of your presidency but on its successful
conduct. You assumed the presidency immediately
after joining the Security Council and managed it as
if you had done the job of leading it a number of times
already. I have always said, and I will say it again today,
that the President's role is like that of a football referee.
The less noticeable he is, the better the footballers play.
But he must always intervene when necessary to get
the game back on the right track. You have combined
that thoughtful referee's ability to maintain a distance
with impartiality and elegance. We thank you for that,
congratulate you on the completion of your mission
and await your return tomorrow to the ranks of us
mere mortals.
