The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of Spain.

Spain voted in favour the draft resolution, in which
we proposed the establishment of an arms embargo on
South Sudan. We believe that such a measure, which
was requested by the Secretary-General, is absolutely
necessary in order to provide a response to the security
and humanitarian situation, which has been described
by experts as catastrophic and unsustainable. We have
been defending such measures for some time, and we
regret the fact that we were not able to adopt them.

The arms embargo is a necessary measure but,
unfortunately, it is not enough. There are signs that
the conflict is running the grave risk of becoming an
ethnic war. The Special Adviser on the Prevention of
Genocide, Mr. Adama Dieng, warned us about a month
ago about the risk of genocide. I would like also to
reiterate that my delegation has never felt that sanctions
were an end in themselves. Rather, we simply believe
that sanctions would reduce violence on the ground.

Lastly, a week after the adoption of resolution 2327
(2016), in which we renewed the mandate of the United
Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), Spain
would like to reiterate its appeal for the urgency of
proceeding to the deployment and full implementation
of the Regional Protection Force. We take note of the
commitment assumed by the Transitional Government
of National Unity, but we must now transition from words
to actions, and we must do so immediately. It is crucial
for UNMISS to be able to operate without restrictions
in order to comply with its mandate, particularly with
respect to the protection of civilians and the safe and
unhindered distribution of humanitarian assistance.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.
I now give the floor to the representative of
South Sudan.
