Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): The
draft resolution (S/2014/l89) was designed to prevent
a further escalation of the crisis in Ukraine. It invited
Council members to uphold the sovereignty, unity and
territorial integrity of a United Nations State Member
and to reaffirm core United Nations principles. It was
about sending a clear signal that holding a referendum
in Crimea would take us further away from a diplomatic
solution. The resounding message from today's vote
is that Russia stands isolated in the Council and in
the international community. Russia alone backs
the referendum. Russia alone is prepared to violate
international law, disregard the Charter of the United
Nations and tear up its bilateral treaties. That message
will be heard well beyond the walls of the Chamber.

The position of the international community is
clear. If the referendum is held tomorrow, it will have
no validity, no credibility and no recognition.

We trust that Russia will take notice of its isolation.
On Thursday, we heard a clear message from the Prime
Minister of Ukraine that Ukraine was willing to engage
in dialogue with Russia to address its stated concerns
(see S/PV.7134). The ball is now firmly in Russia's court.
If Russia fails to respond to Ukraine's outstretched hand
and instead continues with its military adventurism or
seeks to take advantage of the illegal referendum, it
will lead to further escalation of tension in the region
and further consequences for Russia.

We ask Russia to hear the collective voice of the
international community today to rethink its actions
and to take the decision to work with Ukraine and with
the rest of the world to find a peaceful solution.
