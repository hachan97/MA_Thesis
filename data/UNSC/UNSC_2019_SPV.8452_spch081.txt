Mr. Trujillo Garcia (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I want to make a brief statement in response
to a reference was made specifically to the domestic
situation of Colombia. I only wish to take the
opportunity provided by that reference to thank the
Security Council once again for its unanimous support
for the report submitted by the Secretary-General
(S/2018/1159) on the progress that has been made in
the implementation of the Final Agreement for Ending
the Conflict and Building a Stable and Lasting Peace,
signed by the previous Government of Colombia with
the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia-
Ejercito del Pueblo. Unanimous support was lent to that
report, and I simply wanted to take this opportunity to
thank the Security Council for that endorsement.

I also take this opportunity to reiterate the
willingness of the Government of Colombia to comply
with its obligations with respect to counter-terrorism
activities as provided for in resolution 1373 (2001).
