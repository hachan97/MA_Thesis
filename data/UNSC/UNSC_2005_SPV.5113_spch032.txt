The President (spoke in Spanish): Once again, I
would like to welcome the presence of Ambassador
Andrey Denisov, Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism
Committee, and of Mr. Javier Ruperez, Executive
Director of the Counter-Terrorism Executive
Directorate.

After consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council welcomes the
briefing by the Chairman of the Counter-
Terrorism Committee (CTC) on the work of the
Committee.

"The Security Council reaffirms that
terrorism in all its forms and manifestations
constitutes one of the most serious threats to
peace and security and that any acts of terrorism
are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their
motivation, whenever and by whomsoever
committed.

"The Security Council recalls the statement
by its President on 19 October 2004
(S/PRST/2004/37), which indicated the Council's
intention to review the structure and activities of
the CTC; resolution 1535 (2004) on the
revitalization of the Committee; and resolution
1566 (2004) emphasizing the urgent need to
strengthen international cooperation in combating
terrorism.

"The Security Council invites the CTC to
pursue its agenda as set out in the work
programme for the CTC's fourteenth 90-day
period (S/2005/22). It invites the CTC in
particular to ensure that the Counter-Terrorism
Committee Executive Directorate becomes fully
operational in the shortest possible time, and to
take additional measures to enhance cooperation
with the Al Qaeda/Taliban Sanctions Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999)
and the Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1540 (2004), and to initiate contacts
with the working group established pursuant to
resolution 1566 (2004).

"The Security Council notes the importance
of continuing the CTC's efforts in the following
key areas: to enhance the capabilities of Member
States to combat terrorism; to identify and
address the problems faced by States in
implementing resolution 1373 (2001); to facilitate
the provision of technical assistance and
cooperation adjusted to the recipient countries'
needs; to encourage the largest possible number
of States to become parties to the international
conventions and protocols related to counter-
terrorism; and to strengthen its dialogue and
cooperation with international, regional and
subregional organizations acting in the areas
outlined by resolution 1373 (2001).

"The Security Council welcomes the
intention of the CTC to hold its fourth special
meeting with international, regional and
subregional organizations from 26 to 28 January
2005 in Almaty, Kazakhstan.

"The Security Council invites the CTC to
accelerate the preparation of assessments of
Member States' assistance needs so that these can
be shared with the relevant States and, in due
course, with interested donor States and
organizations. The Council invites the CTC to
conduct the first of its visits to Member States in
March 2005 in order to enhance the Committee's
monitoring of the implementation of resolution
1373 (2001) and to facilitate the provision of
technical and other assistance for such
implementation.

"The Security Council notes that, as of
16 December 2004, 75 States had not submitted
their respective reports to the CTC in time, as set
out in resolution 1373 (2001). It calls on them
urgently to do so in order to maintain the
universality of response which the threat of
terrorism and the implementation of resolution
1373 (2001) require.
"The Security Council invites the CTC to
continue reporting on its activities at regular
intervals."

This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2005/3.

The meeting rose at 1.05 pm.
