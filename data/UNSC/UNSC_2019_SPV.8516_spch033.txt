Mr. Apakan: Actually, I have nothing to add to
Ambassador Sajdik's explanations. In Minsk, our
expectation yesterday was to reach a recommitment
to the Easter ceasefire. To that end, there was an
agreement on the date and timing of such a ceasefire. I
am referring to the discussions of the working group on
security. However, each side took a different approach
to the text of the statement. I believe that they missed an
opportunity yesterday.

In response to the question by the Permanent
Representative of Germany, I have to say that, with
regard to access to southern areas of Donetsk, the
non-Government side is a real issue for us. Our access
and observation capacity is limited. I must add that there
is also some limited access to southern border regions.
We have been going to border regions through Izvaryne
more frequently than in past years. However, there are
still some issues, which limits our ability to observe
all of Donbas, particularly the non-Government side.
I do not want to go through specific location names
and details, but that is what we have experienced.
In my briefing today, as well as in Minsk and at the
Permanent Council of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), I emphasized
those points.

Lastly, Ambassador Sajdik referred to the OSCE
Chairperson-in-Office statement on unilateral
measures. I must say that I share Mr. Sajdik's views and
the Chairperson-in-Office on that point.

The meeting rose at 5.15 pm.
