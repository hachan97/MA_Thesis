The President: I thank the Minister for Foreign
Affairs of Belgium for his participation today. I would just
note in passing that with the exception of the presidency,
the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belgium is the thirteenth
speaker and the first to speak from the European continent.
I hope that is indicative of his last point, that this is the rest
of world in support of an African solution, to use Secretary-
General Salim Salim's phrase, an African solution to an
African problem.

We now return to the continent of Africa. It is my
honour to call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of
Burundi, who was with us last week and is still available
under the previous rule. We welcome him back for another
meeting of the Security Council.
