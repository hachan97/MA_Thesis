The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank Mr. De
Serpa Soares for his briefing.
I would like to draw the attention of speakers to
paragraph 22 of presidential note 507 (S/2017/507),
which encourages all participants in Council meetings
to deliver their statements in five minutes or less, in
line with the Security Council's commitment to making
more effective use of open meetings.

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Ivica
Dacie, First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for
Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Serbia.
