The President (spoke in French): I thank the
Secretary-General for his statement.

Before giving the floor to Ms. Arbour to
introduce the report of the International Commission of
Inquiry, I would like, in my capacity as President of the
Security Council, to express my thanks to the
Translation Services, which worked so hard to produce
such a voluminous report in all of the official
languages of the Security Council under extreme time
constraints. I am sure that all of my colleagues share
my gratitude to the translators and all the others
involved with the publication of this document.

I now give the floor to Ms. Louise Arbour, United
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.
