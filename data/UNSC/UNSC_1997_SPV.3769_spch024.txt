Mr. Al-Khalifa (Qatar): I would like to take this
opportunity to thank you, Sir, for convening and presiding

 

over this meeting. At the same time, I would like to take
this opportunity to convey through you my thanks to your
predecessor, our colleague from Poland.

I have the honour and the pleasure to welcome the
formation of the new Government of Unity and National
Reconciliation in Angola on behalf of the Asian Group and
my country. This is truly an important juncture in African
history. After decades of civil strife, the people of Angola
have come together to establish peace and stability in their
country. This peace agreement is a source of pride not only
for the African continent, but also for the world as a whole.
We hope that it will have far-reaching effects on conflict
situations around the world.

In this regard, we call upon the Angolan people to
sustain what has been achieved politically and to
consolidate it on the basis of peace-building and economic
development. To realize this objective, we support the
Secretary-General's conviction that the international
community should remain engaged in Angola until the full
implementation of the Lusaka Protocol is achieved.

The success story in Angola would not have been
possible without the commitment and the generous
contributions of the community of nations. Today we have
a new spirit in the difficult task of peace-making and
peacekeeping. I am sure that the Secretary-General and his
staff spared no effort to achieve this historic accord. For
this they deserve our appreciation and continued support
until the United Nations fulfils its goals of maintaining
peace and security throughout the world, as laid down in
the Charter of the United Nations.
