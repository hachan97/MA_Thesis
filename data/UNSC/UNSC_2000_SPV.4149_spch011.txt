The President (spoke in Chinese): I thank the
representative of the United States for his kind words
addressed to me.

There are no further speakers on my list.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

Statement by the President
The President (spoke in Chinese): As the
President of the Council for this month, I would like to
conclude with a few remarks.

In a few hours the month of May will come to an
end. This afternoon's meeting is the last under my
presidency for this month. This is the first time that I
have served as President of the Council, and in terms
of our work, this month has been busier and more
intense than I had expected. I would like to take this
opportunity to express my gratitude to my colleagues
for their cooperation and support. I would also like to
thank all members of the Secretariat, including the
secretaries, interpreters and translators, for their help.
Without their assiduous work, it would have been
difficult for the Security Council to work efficiently
and effectively during this month.

It is my sincere hope that Ambassador Levitte,
next month's Council President, will have better luck
than I have had.

The meeting rose at 4.55 p.m.
