Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian delegation voted in favour of
resolution 2337 (2017) on the situation in The Gambia
on the basis of the need to ensure the peaceful transfer
of power in the country and avoid bloodshed and further
destabilization. We also voted in support of the efforts
of the Economic Community of West African States
and the African Union to unblock the post-electoral
crisis through peaceful means.

We highly appreciate the mediation efforts of these
organizations, as well as the countries of the region and
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for
West Africa. We hope that the joint efforts will help
to maintain peace and order in The Gambia. Russia
recognized the election results ofl December 2016, and
from the very outset of the crisis has advocated a search
through exclusively peaceful means to resolve it and to
safeguard the security of its citizens and respect for
their fundamental rights and freedoms in accordance
with universally recognized democratic norms. We
note the flexibility shown by the sponsors of the
resolution, aimed at finding the necessary consensus
in the Council.
