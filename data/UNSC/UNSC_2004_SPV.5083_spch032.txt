Mr. Geedi: I would like to express my thanks and
gratitude to the Security Council. I take this
opportunity to answer a few questions posed by
Council members.

The first question was about when the cabinet of
the Transitional Federal Government will be formed.
My answer is that I am consulting with all of the
stakeholders and am within the time frame of the
transitional charter of Somalia. So within the coming
two weeks or before the end of this month, I will come
up with my cabinet.

The other question was about the relocation or
return of the Government to Somalia. I think that my
President stated that we, the Government, will not
remain an exile Government. As soon as we form the
cabinet we will move to Somalia, probably by January
at the latest. The reason is that immediately after the
formation of the cabinet, we are planning to send a
mission of ministers and members of parliament to
travel all over the country. Therefore, on the basis of
their findings and assessments, the Government will
immediately relocate to the country.

Another question raised by speakers was how the
reconciliation process will be completed. That is a
priority of the Government, and the reconciliation
process will be completed through dialogue and in a
peaceful manner throughout all of Somalia.

Therefore, I want lastly to assure the Security
Council that we will be able to address the tasks ahead
of us. We believe that we have an environment
conducive to that among the Somali people and in the
parliament due to the inclusiveness of the
reconciliation process and the achievements made so
far with the support of subregional, regional and
international organizations.
