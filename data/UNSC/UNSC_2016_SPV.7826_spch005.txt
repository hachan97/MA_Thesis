The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Mr. Zerihoun for his briefing.
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements.

I wish to remind all speakers to limit their
statements to no more than five minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
To that end, the presidency will use the flashing lights
on the collars of the microphones to prompt speakers to
bring their remarks to a close.
