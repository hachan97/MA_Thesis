Mr. Allen (United Kingdom): Let me say that the
United Kingdom continues to support the United Nations
Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission
in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA), which
carries out essential work in stabilizing the political
and security situation in the Central African Republic.
That is critical to bringing about peace through the
African Initiative for Peace and Reconciliation in the
Central African Republic and ensuring the well-being
of the people of the Central African Republic. I would
just like to highlight and express my agreement with
the views of the representative of France with respect to
the importance of that African Union initiative.

We understand that the domestic legal processes
of the United States required it to request an extension
for the existing MINUSCA mandate. We appreciate
France's flexibility on the matter and its efforts to
ensure a consensus in the Security Council on the
continuity of Mission operations by facilitating the
temporary extension of the mandate. We look forward
to coming together to adopt the new mandate within the
next month.
