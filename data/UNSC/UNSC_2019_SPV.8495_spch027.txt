Mr. Danon (Israel): I never thought that I would
agree with the Syrian Ambassador. I agree with him
only on one issue today. The United Nations is obsessed
with Israel, considering the number of resolutions,
debates and statements on the issue. I regret that
because I really believe that if the United Nations had
focused on what happened in Syria in the past few
years, perhaps we would have been able to prevent the
massacres, the use of chemical weapons, the rapes and
what Syria did to its own people.

Today, we feel for the Syrian people, whom the
Ambassador represents. We feel for them because they
have to deal with such a regime. I would like to say
directly to the Syrian people that the day will come
when they will have a real representative, who will
represent their needs and make their voices heard.
There will be someone else in Damascus and someone
else sitting in the Chamber, who will be recognized by
the international community. We are thinking about
and praying for them.

The meeting rose at 7.35 pm.
