Mrs. Furman (Israel): I find it unbelievable that
the representative of Syria still has the audacity to
speak during a debate about the protection of civilians.
The Al-Assad regime has slaughtered more than 15,000
of its own people. Thousands more are being killed day
by day. The Syrian representative still believes that
saying the magic word "Israel" will help to hide these
appalling crimes. His desperate words say nothing
about Israel and everything about the despicable regime
that he represents.

It is no secret that the Iranian Government is
actively targeting innocent civilians day after day,
inside and outside of its country. Listening to the
Iranian representative speak during this debate on the
protection of civilians brings to mind George Orwell's
novel 1984, where war is peace, freedom is slavery, and
ignorance is strength.

I do not think I need to say anything more.
