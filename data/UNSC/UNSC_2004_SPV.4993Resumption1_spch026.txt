Mr. Caillaux: I will certainly not try to
summarize the very rich discussion we had throughout
the day. I will just limit myself to three central points
that I have gotten from this discussion.

The first one really is the focus on the local level
and the importance of what you yourself, Madam
President, have defined as the healing power, the
healing potential of civil society. I think this is what it
is all about in the peace-building process we have been
discussing. You have expressed that very, very well.
Certainly for an organization like the one I represent,
this is the core of our mandate. Our mandate is
fundamentally to facilitate the process of emergence of
this local civil society and then to gently recede into

the background and support them in whatever way we
can.

That leads me to my second point, which has
been raised by some speakers. Indeed, we - civil
society organizations - have to work hard at our own
accountability, particularly our accountability to our
beneficiaries. It is certainly a process that we are
getting into with seriousness and dedication, and I am
privileged to have initiated, at the beginning of the year
with about dozen like-minded organizations, what we
call a humanitarian accountability partnership, whereby
at our humble level we look seriously and honestly at
our own accountability to our beneficiaries. I think it is
a very healthy process that is absolutely fundamental if
we are to really be genuinely part of the kind of role
that has been discussed here today.

But I guess, above all, I will leave this debate
reassured that Council members and Member States
generally will be firm in setting and enforcing the rule
of law, thereby creating a secure environment and
ensuring the protection of civilians that is required to
enable their own energies and skill to really flourish in
the building of peace.
