Mr. Moraes Cabral (Portugal): I had not intended
to speak at this meeting and, as usual, will keep my
comments for our consultations later. But I must say
that I should dispel the erroneous impression that the
African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape
Verde (PAIGC), which we all know is the majority party
in Guinea-Bissau, is part of the Government. It is not
part of the Transitional Government. The gentlemen
who were mentioned have not had any connection
with the PAIGC for a long time now, as has been made
clear by successive communiques of the legitimate
authorities of the Party.

My second comment, related to the first, is that what
has been called this afternoon the Carlos Gomes Junior
faction ofthe PAIGC does in fact translate to two-thirds
of the members of the Parliament in Guinea-Bissau. I
think to call them a faction lacks elegance, if nothing
else.

My third comment, and I will finish here, is that
international partners have indeed refrained from
collaborating with the illegitimate authorities. But
let me assure the Council that those international
institutions that have refrained from collaborating with
those behind the coup d'etat will continue to do so.
That means not collaborating until a credible political
transition is put in place.

Finally, concerning what was described as
the normalcy of life in Guinea-Bissau, I will only
refer to what Mr. Mutaboba said about the rise in
criminal activity and drug trafficking. I apologize for
intervening.
