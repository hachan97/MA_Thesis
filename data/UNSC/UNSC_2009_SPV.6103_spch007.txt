The President (spoke in Spanish): I am certain
that members of the Council will pay due heed to the
appeal made today by the representative of Guinea-
Bissau to the Council and to the international
community to support the process under way in
Guinea-Bissau.

There are no further speakers on my list. In
accordance with the understanding reached in the
Council's prior consultations, I should now like to
invite Council members to informal consultations to
continue our discussion of the subject.

The meeting rose at 11.05 am.
