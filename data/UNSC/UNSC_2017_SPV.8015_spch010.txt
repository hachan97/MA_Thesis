The President (spoke in Chinese): There are no
more names inscribed on the list of speakers.

As this is the last scheduled meeting ofthe Security
Council for the month of July, before adjourning the
meeting I would like to express the delegation of
China's sincere appreciation to the members of the
Council, especially my colleagues the Permanent
Representatives and their staffs, and to the secretariat
of the Council, for all the support they have given us.

It has indeed been a busy month, and one in which
we rallied to achieve consensus on several important
issues within our purview. We could not have done it
alone or without the hard work, support and positive
contributions of every delegation and the representatives
of the secretariat, as well as all the relevant conference
service officers, interpreters and translators. As we end
our presidency, I know I speak on behalf of the Council
in wishing the delegation of Egypt good luck for the
month of August.

I now invite Council members to informal
consultations to continue our discussion on the subject.

The meeting rose at11.10 am.
