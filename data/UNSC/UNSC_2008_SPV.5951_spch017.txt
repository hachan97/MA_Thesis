Mr. Alasania (Georgia): Very briefly, I want to
reiterate a few issues which were raised by my very
respected colleague, Ambassador Churkin. First of all,
I probably did not make myself quite clear: I was
saying that the Russian side had explained to the
Georgian side that they had no control over the South
Ossetian regime. That is why things were getting out of
hand. I did not say that the Russians - the Russian
security and defence services - really do not have

control of the armed forces of the separatist regime. I
demonstrated very clearly who are the core decision-
makers in the South Ossetian Government - former
and current Federal Security Service (FSB) and
defence officials - precisely for that reason: for the
Council to understand who is really making decisions
in Tskhinvali.

On the other issue, I would like to stress that we
welcome the cooperation of the Russian Federation and
the United States, which is now happening at a high
level, to ease the tensions and to de-escalate the
situation. That is exactly what Georgia wants and that
is exactly what was proposed by President Saakashvili
recently - last night - in a televised address. And
that is exactly what we are offering our friends at the
08-45458
negotiating table: the State Minister for Conflict
Resolution, who was willing to go, and actually went,
to Tskhinvali twice to negotiate and who was rejected
by the separatist regime, was bringing those same
proposals.

So I would close my remarks with the hope that
reason will prevail in this situation and that both sides,
and the Russian Federation as well, will come to the
negotiating table and will resolve this conflict in a
peaceful manner.
