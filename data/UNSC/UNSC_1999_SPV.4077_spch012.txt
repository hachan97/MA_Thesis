Mr. van Walsum (Netherlands): I am sorry to take
the floor again, but I wanted to point out that non-
participation in the voting is extremely rare and that few
non-permanent members have ever resorted to this
extraordinary measure.

My Foreign Minister, in the General Assembly,
suggested that it might be useful to start looking for a
way in which permanent members might express their
absolutely negative attitude without being obliged to cast
a veto. I had simply hoped that we were seeing an
example of this procedure, in which a permanent member
said no without casting a veto. I was hoping that it was
this new element that we saw introduced today.
