The President: On behalf of the Council, I would
like to express our gratitude to Ms. Karin Landgren,
who is today making her last briefing to the Council in
her capacity as Representative of the Secretary-General
in Nepal. We have appreciated her leadership of the
United Nations Mission in Nepal, and we wish her
every success in her future endeavours.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. In accordance with the understanding reached in
the Council's prior consultations, I now invite Council
members to informal consultations to continue our
discussion on the subject.
