Mr. Mahmood (Pakistan): In the context of the
illegal exploitation of resources, the Pakistan

delegation has consistently stated that the tracking of
financial resources is important in order to eliminate
the root causes of conflict. We would have liked to
have an appropriate reflection of that in paragraphs 8
and 10 of the resolution. However, in the spirit of
flexibility, we agreed to go along with the text. We
will, ofcourse, continue to refer to this subject as we

move forward in our work for the implementation of
this resolution.
