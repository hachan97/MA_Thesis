The President (spoke in Russian): After
consultations among members of the Security Council,
I have been authorized to make the following statement
on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council continues to be
gravely concerned by the threat that piracy and
armed robbery at sea against vessels pose to the
situation in Somalia and other States in the
region, as well as to international navigation and
the safety of commercial maritime routes.

"The Security Council strongly believes that
persons responsible for acts of piracy and armed
robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, including
those who incite or intentionally facilitate such
acts, should be brought to justice, and considers
in this regard that the effective prosecution of
suspected pirates and their supporters may deter
future pirate attacks. The Council therefore
deems it of utmost importance to find long-term
solutions to the problem of prosecuting
suspected, and imprisoning convicted, pirates,
which achieve and sustain substantive results
with a view to contributing to the reinforcement
of the rule of law in Somalia, and recalls in this
regard that peace and stability within Somalia,
the strengthening of State institutions, economic
and social development and respect for human
rights and the rule of law are necessary to create
the conditions for a durable eradication of piracy
and armed robbery at sea off its coast.

"The Security Council welcomes the report
of the Secretary-General (S/2010/394), as
requested by its resolution 1918 (2010), on
possible options to further the aim of prosecuting
and imprisoning persons responsible for acts of
piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of
Somalia, including, in particular, options for
creating special domestic chambers possibly with
international components, a regional tribunal or
an international tribunal and corresponding
imprisonment arrangements, taking into account
the work of the Contact Group on Piracy off the
Coast of Somalia (CGPCS), the existing practice
in establishing international and mixed tribunals,
and the time and resources necessary to achieve
and sustain substantive results. The Council notes
that the report identifies the challenges faced in
tackling this problem, in particular the limited
judicial capacity of States in the region, prison
capacity and repatriation arrangements for
suspects prosecuted by foreign courts, and
believes that it provides a solid base for future
work in order to enhance international, regional
and national cooperation in bringing pirates to
justice.

"The Security Council commends the
ongoing efforts of States, including States in the
region, in particular Kenya and the Seychelles, to
prosecute suspected pirates in their national
courts, stressing the need for all States to
continue these efforts, including through
criminalizing piracy under their domestic law.

"The Security Council stresses the need for
States and international organizations to continue
addressing the problem of the limited capacity of
the judicial and the corrections systems of
Somalia and other States in the region to
effectively prosecute and detain, pending trial,
suspected, and imprison convicted, pirates. In this

regard the Council appreciates the assistance
being provided by the United Nations Office on
Drugs and Crime and other international
organizations and donors, in coordination with
the CGPCS, to enhance the capacity of the
judicial and the corrections systems in Somalia,
Kenya, the Seychelles and other States in the
region to prosecute suspected, and imprison
convicted, pirates consistent with applicable
international human rights law. The Council also
reaffirms that international law, as reflected in the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
of 10 December 1982, in particular its articles
100, 101 and 105, sets out the legal framework
applicable to combating piracy and armed
robbery at sea, as well as other ocean activities.

"The Security Council emphasizes the need
for regular review of progress achieved in
prosecution of and imprisonment of persons
responsible for acts of piracy and armed robbery
at sea off the coast of Somalia, including those
who incite or intentionally facilitate such acts,
with a view to considering possible further steps
to ensure that such persons are held accountable.
The Council encourages the CGPCS to continue
discussion in this regard, taking into account
advantages and disadvantages of the various
options described in the Secretary-General's
report.

"The Security Council welcomes the
intention of the Secretary-General to appoint a
Special Adviser to him on Legal Issues Related to
Piracy off the Coast of Somalia, bearing in mind
the importance of the coordination of efforts by
the Secretariat, including the Special Adviser,
with the ongoing work of all relevant
international actors.

"The Security Council requests the
Secretary-General to include in his report to the
Council pursuant to paragraph 17 of its resolution
1897 (2009) any new information and
observations, taking into account the work of the
CGPCS, on possible ways to advance the ongoing
cooperation, including with States in the region in
prosecuting and imprisoning persons responsible
for acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the
coast of Somalia.
"The Security Council expresses its
intention to remain seized of the matter."

This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol
S/PRST/2010/16.

I shall now give the floor to the members of the
Council.
