Mr. Bonser (Canada): We have heard many
speakers today, and I promise I will be brief.

Peacekeepers operate in increasingly complex and
volatile environments, often putting themselves in
harm's way to protect vulnerable civilian populations.
As many have said today, asymmetrical threats will
continue to be a critical risk to peace operations for
the foreseeable future. Both the United Nations and
personnel-contributing countries must therefore
urgently adapt to such threats. The objective is clearly
not to make peace operations a substitute for counter-
terrorism initiatives but to ensure that deployed
personnel can carry out their missions as efficiently
and safely as possible.

In order to ensure both the sustainability of
deployed personnel and the successful delivery of
robust mandates, in particular with regard to the
protection of civilians, the United Nations must enhance
missions' preparation, performance and responsiveness
through an integrated and tailored approach. That
approach means developing adequate conceptual
frameworks and providing specialized training as well
as the equipment, intelligence and enabling capabilities
needed to effectively meet asymmetrical threats. The
United Nations must also strengthen its analytical
capacity in that area.

(spoke in French)

We must also ensure that our approach to
asymmetrical threats is not confined to the security
front. It is vital that the full range of factors that can
lead to violent extremism be addressed through a
comprehensive approach. Canada is always ready
to share relevant lessons learned in dealing with
asymmetrical threats in Afghanistan, and would
welcome the opportunity to gain from the experience
of its various partners present today.
