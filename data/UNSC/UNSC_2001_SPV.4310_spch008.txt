Mr. Cooney (Ireland): I shall be brief. I would
like to thank Mr. Guehenno for his briefing and for the
good news that he has brought today. We agree with his
proposal relating to elements for the message that the
Council should send out from today's discussion.

I would like to make just one point, relating to the
work of the Boundary Commission. We agree with his
suggestion that the Council urge the parties to
cooperate with the Secretary-General with a view to
removing the obstacles to the start of work of the
Commission. But we would also like the Council to
remind the parties of their obligation to provide
financial contributions to the work of the Commission
as a tangible demonstration of their commitment to this
process.
