Mr. Klimkin (Ukraine): I would like to respond
to what the Russian representative said a few moments
ago. With regard to the point about the proper format
for addressing various issues, our basic view is
that Russia violated the Budapest Memorandum on
security assurances and various other legal written
and unwritten commitments, which has created an
atmosphere of impunity, which has contributed to the
situation in which we now find ourselves.

As I listened to your statement, Mr. President - in
which the narrative was basically about the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea's violations of international
law and sanctions, and its taking ofhostages - I realized
that the same narrative, in fact, applies to Russia and
its violations of international law and sanctions and its
taking of hostages. There we have one big rogue State
and one smaller rogue State, and the difference is only
one of scale.

I also wanted to react to one point that in my view
represents a twisted, irresponsible and astounding
kind of logic. The Russian representative said that in
a way, North Korea's nuclear and missile programme
is a response to the exercises being conducted on
and around the Korean peninsula. This year, Russia
has been carrying out huge military drills in Belarus
while trying to confuse everyone about their objective
and scale. So, following Russia's logic, I should now
call for my country to become a nuclear Power and
develop a missile programme. In a way, that embodies
an enormously irresponsible way of thinking that could
trigger a worldwide nuclear arms race tomorrow. In my
view, what it shows is that we must stop trying to find
any excuse we can for any wrongful behaviour. That is
my fundamental point, and Ijust wanted to take this
opportunity to make it again.
