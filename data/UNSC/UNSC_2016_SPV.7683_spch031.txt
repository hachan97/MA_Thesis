Ms. Sison (United States of America): Rather than
talk about some hidden agenda of the United States, it
is our view that the Russian Federation delegation, and
all delegations represented on the Security Council,
should work together to re-establish the ceasefire,
arrive at a peaceful de-escalation of the crisis and work
out a peaceful resolution on the ground.

We have just received a draft press statement with
the Russian Federation's suggestion that the Security
Council should consider that draft statement on the
situation in Ukraine. The United States is ready to
engage in a discussion with Council members on a draft
that reflects our consensus View of the situation in its
entirety. Let us recall the situation. I underscore again
that the current crisis in Ukraine is the result of Russia's
aggression and violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and
territorial integrity.
