The President: I will now give the floor to
members of the Council.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers
of the Council and all other speakers to limit their
statements to no more than three minutes. I have 40
speakers in all on my list, and I think a limit to the
speaking time is necessary in order to enable the
Council to carry out its work expeditiously. I would
like to ask delegations with lengthy statements to
kindly circulate their text in writing and to deliver a
condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.
