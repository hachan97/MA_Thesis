The President: The Security Council will now

begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members

to document S/2016/232, which contains the report of
the Secretary-General on the implementation of the
Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the
Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region.

After consultations among Council members, I

have been authorized to make the following statement
on their behalf:

"The Security Council takes note of the report
of the Secretary-General on the implementation
of the Peace, Security and Cooperation (PSC)
Framework for the Democratic Republic of the
Congo and the Region (S/2016/232).

"The Security Council regrets that progress
made in the implementation of national and
regional commitments under the PSC Framework
remains limited and stresses the importance of
the signatory States fully implementing their
national and regional commitments under the
PSC Framework, which remains essential for the
achievement of lasting peace and security in the
Great Lakes region.

"The Security Council reiterates the importance
of neutralizing all armed groups operating in
the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo,
particularly the Forces democratiques de liberation
du Rwanda, the Allied Democratic Forces, the
Lord's Resistance Army and the Mai Mai groups in
line with Security Council resolution 2277 (2016).
It notes, in this regard, the announcement of the
resumption of joint military operations between
the Government of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo and the United Nations Organization
Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic

of the Congo and calls for immediate restart of
joint operations to be undertaken in earnest to
bring about the complete neutralization of all
armed groups operating in the eastern Democratic
Republic of the Congo.

"The Security Council calls upon the
Governments of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Uganda and Rwanda to strengthen their
collaboration to ensure the repatriation of former
Mouvement du 23 mars (M-23) combatants located
in Rwanda and Uganda, consistent with the Nairobi
Declarations and in line with commitments under
the PSC Framework and reiterates the importance of
ensuring that all provisions of the signed documents
are implemented swiftly and in good faith.

"The Security Council recalls the regional
commitment under the PSC Framework not to
harbour war criminals or provide support to
armed groups, including recruitment, and urges all
countries in the Great Lakes region to implement
this provision of the PSC Framework and to make
concerted efforts to investigate any allegations
that former M-23 members have committed
serious crimes under international law and to hold
accountable those responsible.

"The Security Council is of the view that
children have been major victims of the conflicts
in the Great Lakes region, and stresses the absolute
need to eliminate their recruitment into armed
groups, and the need to empower young people
and promote youth employment initiatives at the
regional level.

"The Security Council calls upon all countries
in the Great Lakes region to comply with their
obligations under international law, including
international human rights law and international
humanitarian law, and encourages them to actively
pursue accountability for those who commit human
rights Violations and abuses and violations of
international humanitarian law.

"The Security Council welcomes the credible
and peaceful conduct of elections in some States
of the Great Lakes region. The Security Council
notes, however, that recent and ongoing electoral
processes in some countries of the Great Lakes
region raise deep concerns about the risk of
instability, insecurity, the potential for violence,
human rights violations and abuses and violations

of international humanitarian law, and further
displacement of people, which impact all countries
of the Great Lakes region.
"The Security Council urges regional support
for initiatives aimed at promoting inclusive dialogue
amongst national stakeholders and stresses the
importance of opening political space to enable
the full and free participation of peaceful political
parties, civil society and the media in the political
process. The Security Council further urges
regional support for strengthening and improving
capacity for elections and governance in the
countries of the Great Lakes region. The Council
calls on Member States in the Great Lakes region
to take steps to ensure that electoral processes
promote peace and security through timely,
peaceful, inclusive and credible elections, in line
with countries own constitutions and the African
Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance,
as applicable.

"The Security Council is gravely concerned
that the continued illicit exploitation of and trade
in natural resources in the eastern Democratic
Republic of the Congo. The Council urges the
signatory States of the PSC Framework, regional
organizations and the international community to
coordinate their efforts to undercut the economic
lifelines of armed groups that benefit from the
illegal exploitation of and trade in natural resources,
and prevent the exploitation of women and children
in the trade of these resources.

"The Security Council takes note of the
Regional Strategic Framework for the Great lakes
region 2016-2017, presented to the Council by
the Secretary-General, which outlines the United
Nations development approach in support of the
implementation of the PSC Framework under six
pillars: sustainable natural resource management,
economic integration and cross-border trade;
food security and nutrition; mobility; youth and
adolescents; sexual and gender-based violence; and
justice and conflict prevention.

"The Security Council also notes that the
Regional Strategic Framework seeks to shift
the illegal exploitation of natural resources into
legal, regulated business, more sustainable use
of natural resources and its transformation into
development outcomes, implying the transparent

and accountable management of these resources,
which could result in significant earnings for the
states and the communities.

"The Security Council, without prejudice to
the conclusions of the future mandate review of
the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the
Great Lakes Region, also takes note of the road map
of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for
the Great Lakes Region and the priorities identified
for regional action.

"The Security Council stresses that the 2006
Pact on Security, Stability and Development in
the Great Lakes Region and the PSC Framework
for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the
region are mutually reinforcing, and are crucial
tools to achieve long-term peace and prosperity.
The Council emphasizes that the PSC Framework
demonstrates that peace, security and development
are interlinked and underscores the importance of
strengthening regional cooperation, including the
deepening of economic integration.

"The Security Council urges the donor
community to contribute to the implementation of
the Regional Strategic Framework and the Special
Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Great
Lakes Region's road map, as an effective platform
for partnership, in support of Member States in
the national and regional commitments aimed
to address the root causes of conflicts, promote
economic development and cooperation, and bring
about durable peace in the Great Lakes region.

"The Security Council commends the efforts
of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for
the Great Lakes Region and welcomes the Private
Sector Investment Conference which took place
in Kinshasa on 24 and 25 February 2016, jointly
organized by the Office of the Special Envoy and
the International Conference on the Great Lakes
Region (ICGLR), and hosted by the Government of
the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

"The Security Council further stresses that
the momentum generated by the Private Sector
Investment Conference should be built upon
through the operationalization of the ICGLR
Private Sector Forum to realize investments and
stimulate job creation and livelihood opportunities
as effective tools for conflict prevention and the
consolidation of peace and security in the Great
Lakes region.

"The Security Council underscores that
solutions to the prevailing situation in the Great
Lakes region should come within a regional
perspective by addressing the root causes of
conflicts, many of which are regional in nature,
with cross-border issues linked to the eastern
Democratic Republic of the Congo assuming
crucial significance, due to the large flows of
natural resources and migrants and refugees, and
activities of armed groups and criminal networks
across the borders.

"The Security Council stresses that the forced
displacement of millions of persons in the Great
Lakes region is a key driver of conflict, leading
to regional instability, insecurity, humanitarian
consequences and human rights violations
and abuses.

"The Security Council encourages regional
initiatives aimed at increasing youth employment
and livelihoods, to enhance young people's
economic self-sufficiency and the development of
entrepreneurial skills, particularly marginalized
adolescents and young people in the border areas
of the Great Lakes region countries and those
formerly associated with armed groups.

"The Security Council shares the view
expressed in the Regional Strategic Framework
that there is an urgent need to address violence
and discrimination against women and girls,
including rape and other forms of sexual violence
in the Great Lakes region, and take into account
the link between women's participation in peace
and security decision-making, for peace and
gender equality.

"The Security Council supports the regional
initiatives on the issue of gender-related violence
in armed conflict to influence regional and local
decision-makers, aimed at the implementation
of the commitments of the Kampala Declaration
addressing impunity for gender-based crimes at the
country level and to improve women's visibility,
empowerment and resilience.

"The Security Council, noting the link between
justice and conflict prevention, calls upon countries
of the Great Lakes region to hold accountable
perpetrators of human rights violations and abuses
and violations of international humanitarian law
and to effectively support measures of conflict
prevention by ending the culture of impunity.

"The Security Council welcomes efforts by
national Governments to reverse such trends by
setting a strategy that seeks to realize tangible
improvements in holding accountable those
responsible for violations and abuses of human
rights and violations of international humanitarian
law and to build trust between citizens
and Governments.

"The Security Council underlines the
importance of peacebuilding efforts to prevent
relapses into conflict and encourages close
cooperation between the Peacebuilding
Commission and relevant regional organizations.

"The Security Council takes note of the
priority interventions set in the Regional Strategic
Framework to strengthen institutions, mechanisms
and capacities for conflict prevention, management,
resolution and peacebuilding through cross-
border initiatives and partnerships at the regional
level, including the ICGLR and civil society
organizations; strengthen regional efforts by
increasing controls on the supply of small arms and
light weapons, which are a major source of conflict
in the Great Lakes region; and enhance judicial
cooperation, including law enforcement, border
control, prosecution services, judicial bodies
and the legal profession, especially by improving
cooperation between Governments, justice
institutions and local communities, particularly in
cross border areas of the Great Lakes region."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2OI6/2.

The meeting rose at 10.45 am.
