The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in the course of its prior
consultations.

At this meeting, I shall make a briefing in my
capacity as the Chairman of the Security Council
Committee established pursuant to resolution 1737
(2006).

(spoke in English)

In my capacity as Chairman of the Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1737 (2006), of
23 December 2006, I have the honour to report to the
Security Council, in accordance with subparagraph
18 (h) of that resolution, on the period 24 March to
21 June 2007.

Shortly after I delivered my first 90-day report,
on 24 March 2007 (see S/PV.5646), the Council
adopted resolution 1747 (2007), by which it imposed
additional measures relating to the Islamic Republic of
Iran. Those measures included a ban on the export of
arms and related materiel from Iran, the designation of
additional persons as subject to the assets freeze and to
the travel measures, and the designation of additional
entities as subject to the assets freeze. In addition, the
Council called upon all States to exercise vigilance and
restraint in the supply of the seven categories of
conventional weapons as defined for the purposes of
the United Nations Register on Conventional Arms and
related services to Iran, and called upon all States and
international financial institutions not to enter into new
commitments for grants, financial assistance and
concessional loans to the Government of Iran, except
for humanitarian and developmental purposes

Meanwhile, the mandate of the Committee, as set
out in paragraph 18 of resolution 1737 (2006), has
remained essentially unchanged. Since I last reported
2

to the Council, the members of the Committee have
met in eight sessions of informal consultations,
bringing the total number of informal sessions to 14,
mostly to continue the consideration of the guidelines
for the conduct of the Committee's work. In addition,
the Committee convened two formal meetings.

I am pleased to inform the Council that, as a
result of intense and fruitful discussions, the guidelines
were adopted at the second formal meeting of the
Committee, on 30 May 2007. The outcome, I feel, is a
clear and well-balanced set of principles to guide the
Committee's work, consistent with the letter and the
spirit of resolution 1737 (2006), and also taking into
account resolution 1747 (2007). It represents a
consensus and addresses, to the greatest extent
possible, all the concerns that were raised. I should
also highlight that the guidelines incorporate the
delisting procedure as set out by the Security Council
in resolution 1730 (2006), of 19 December 2006. The
text of the guidelines has been transmitted to all
Member States for their information and use, as
necessary, and is also available on the Committee's
web page.

In paragraph 8 of resolution 1747 (2007), the
Council called upon all States to report to the
Committee within 60 days of the adoption of that
resolution on the steps they had taken with a view to
implementing effectively paragraphs 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of
that resolution. Accordingly, in my capacity as
Chairman, I transmitted a note verbale dated 20 April
2007 to all Member States, drawing their attention to
paragraph 8 of the resolution. The note verbale also
served as a reminder to those States that had not yet
reported under paragraph 19 of resolution 1737 (2006)
of their obligation to do so. Those States were given
the option to submit a combined report under both
resolutions if they so wished.

As of today, the Committee has received reports
from 50 Member States, as well as a report from the
European Union, pursuant to resolution 1747 (2007).
Of those, l5 reports were received by the deadline, that
is, on or before 23 May 2007, and seven are combined
reports under both resolutions 1737 (2006) and 1747
(2007). The Committee has also received seven
additional reports pursuant to resolution 1737 (2006).
That brings the total number of reports received under
resolution 1737 (2006) to 73. As before, I would like to
inform the Council that, out of the 50 reports received
within the past three months under resolution 1747
07-39046
(2007), 38 States reported that they already had
legislation in place that covered the relevant
paragraphs of the resolution. A further 12 States
reported on the steps they had taken, or will be taking,
to put the necessary legal framework into place.
Finally, all States that submitted reports assured the
Committee of their commitment to implementing
resolutions 1747 (2007) and/or 1737 (2006) and to
meeting their obligations as outlined therein.

Although during the reporting period the main
focus of the members of the Committee was on the
Committee's guidelines, the Committee also dealt in
parallel with a number of notifications and requests for
exemptions with respect to the measures imposed by
the Council. Pursuant to paragraph 15 of resolution
1737 (2006), which does not require a Committee
decision, the Committee has received 10 notifications
of the unfreezing of assets or receipt of payment in
connection with contracts entered into prior to the
listing of certain entities.

The Committee has also granted, pursuant to
subparagraphs 13 (a) and 13 (b), respectively, of the
same resolution, six exemptions to the assets freeze to
cover basic expenses and three exemptions to the
assets freeze to cover extraordinary expenses, as
determined by the relevant States, of listed entities.
Lastly, the Committee has received, pursuant to
paragraph 10 of resolution 1737 (2006) and paragraph
2 of resolution 1747 (2007), a notification concerning
the travel of a listed individual.

As part of its role of monitoring the
implementation of the measures imposed by the
Security Council, the Committee has considered, and
responded to, two written requests for clarification,
received from Member States, concerning certain
aspects of the sanctions regime imposed by resolutions
1737 (2006) and 1747 (2007).

This concludes my summary of the Committee's
activities. In addition to dealing with requests for
exemption set out in paragraphs 9, 13 and 15 of
resolution 1737 (2006), on which I have reported, the
Committee has a mandate to designate additional
persons and entities as subject to the assets freeze and,
in the case of the former, also to the measures
concerning travel. The Committee also has a mandate,
under paragraph 3 (d) of resolution 1737 (2006), to
determine any additional items, et cetera, which could
contribute to Iran's enrichment-related, reprocessing or
07-39046

heavy-water-related activities, or to the development of
nuclear weapon delivery systems. During the reporting
period, the Committee did not receive any requests for
designation of individuals or entities on the basis of the
criteria contained in resolution 1737 (2006). Nor did
the Committee receive any requests to include any
additional items in the lists of proscribed items.

The 1737 Committee will continue to discharge
its mandate as effectively and as efficiently as possible.

(spoke in French)

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

I shall now give the floor to those Council
members who wish to make comments or ask questions
in response to the briefing just given.
