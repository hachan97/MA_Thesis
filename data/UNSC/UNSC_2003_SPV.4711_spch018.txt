Mr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): Allow me at the outset, Sir, to express my
heartfelt condolences to the Governments of
Afghanistan and of Pakistan with respect to the air
crash that killed the Afghan Minister for Mines and
Industry as well as several Pakistani officials.

We would like to welcome among us
Mr. Guehenno, Ambassador Nishimura and
Ambassador Braun, and we thank them all for their
important briefings. Mr. Guehenno briefed us on the
general security situation in Afghanistan, and Mr.
Braun on the re-establishment of the civil police. We
thank them for the detailed information they provided
in this regard. Likewise, we would like also to thank
Mr. Nishimura, who described the disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme in
Afghanistan.

In brief, we have a comment and a question. We
heard Mr. Guehenno say that the security situation in
Afghanistan remains fragile and that the security
environment has not been what we would have all
wished for. Naturally, we believe that there is a
connection between what Mr. Guehenno has said and
the facts presented by Mr. Braun and Mr. Nishimura.
We think that, for us to be able to undertake Mr.
Braun's and Mr. Nishimura's ambitious programmes,
we must take into account the comments made by Mr.
Guehenno.

We believe that the DDR process will be lengthy
and that therefore we must link the reconstruction
efforts with the demobilization process.

How do Mr. Nishimura and Mr. Braun intend to
bridge the gap between reconstruction and
demobilization on the one hand and the security
situation on the other?
