Mrs. ngu (Nigeria): The humanitarian situation
in Syria is a consequence of the unabated brutal
violence which has so far defied any logic or solution.

Syria's centrality to stability in the region
underscores the imperative for the Council to act
in concert to ensure rapid, safe and unimpeded
humanitarian access to populations in need of
assistance across the country. It is for this reason that
Nigeria recognizes the imperative of supporting any
peaceful initiative that seeks to alleviate the suffering
of Syrians and leads to a permanent political solution to
the protracted conflict.

We are confident that the collective action that we
have taken today in adopting this resolution (resolution 2139 (2014)) is a significant and giant step towards
protecting the defenceless civililans, including women
and children, in Syria, who continue to bear the brunt
of the deadly confrontation between opposing forces.

We express regret that there was no consensus on
the inclusion of a paragraph in the final text calling
upon all States to refrain from transferring arms to
the parties in the Syrian conflict, given that such
arms could be used to commit or to facilitate Syria's
violations or abuses of international human rights or
humanitarian law.

Nonetheless, the adoption of this resolution today
is a powerful and visible demonstration of the renewed
commitment of the Council to work in the higher
interests of the Syrian people. We expect that concerted
effort to be replicated subsequently in the Council's
future efforts.

We want in particular to commend Australia,
Jordan and Luxembourg not only for their leadership,
but especially for accommodating the views of Council
members in the course of the negotiations.
