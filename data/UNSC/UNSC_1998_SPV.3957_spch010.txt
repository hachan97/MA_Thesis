Mr. Niehaus (Costa Rica) (interpretation from Spanish): My delegation would like to thank Ambassador
Dahlgren and Under-Secretary-General Miyet for the very
timely and important information they have given us on
Sierra Leone. We would also like to thank you,
Mr. President, for taking the wise decision of continuing
this practice of open briefings, which is essential for the
transparency of the work of the Council and which we
believe should be followed in the future.

During his visit to the United Nations a few months
ago, President Kabbah said that he was giving particular
attention to the idea of demilitarizing the country and
putting it under civil control. Costa Rica understands that
the security situation in Sierra Leone is very complex as

 

a result of the activities of the rebels who carried out the
coup d'e'tat. We also understand that, in the light of these
circumstances, it may be very difficult and perhaps even
untimely for the Government to take concrete steps to move
in that direction.

Our own national experience has shown us and
convinced us of the opportunities presented for small,
developing countries by the demilitarization of society. This
is why we would like to draw attention to this issue and
express our hope that Sierra Leone will be able to make
progress towards that goal in the future.
