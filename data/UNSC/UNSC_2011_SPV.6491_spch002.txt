Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): The
British Government welcomes the unanimous adoption
of Security Council resolution 1970 (2011). The United
Kingdom presented the text of this resolution because
of our grave concern about the appalling situation in
Libya. The violence we have seen and the incitement to
further violence by Colonel Al-Qadhafi are totally
2
unacceptable, and my Government has expressed its
profound condemnation of them.

Today's resolution demands an immediate end to
violence and repression, full respect for human rights
and international law, and accountability for those
responsible for the violence. It gives practical effect to
those demands through travel bans, asset freezes, an
arms embargo and immediate referral to the
International Criminal Court.

The adoption of resolution 1970 (2011) by all 15
members of the Council is a powerful signal of the
determination of the international community to stand
with the people of Libya and defend their right to
determine their own future.
