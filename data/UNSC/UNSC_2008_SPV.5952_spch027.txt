Mr. Alasania (Georgia): In response, when I
made a statement that Georgian authorities never
targeted the Russian Federation's peacekeepers, that
means that we never targeted the peacekeepers. Those
who were targeted were mercenaries from the Russian
Federation and also those who were actually shooting
at and shelling Georgian positions and the Georgian
civilian population. But, as I mentioned, it is true -
and members can verify this through their own sources
back in Georgia - that Georgia never targeted the
peacekeepers on the ground.

Now, in terms of ethnic cleansing, yes, I was
appalled and again, I want to reiterate that we do
not want to go into too many details today because
there is an urgent need to stop the violence today - at
the Russian Federation President's decisions to
legitimize the separatist regimes, who were
perpetrators of ethnic cleansing. This is a matter of
great concern, and it has been discussed numerous
times at the Security Council. Unfortunately, there was
a strong statement from Security Council members, but
the decision was never reversed. We are seeing today
the methodical occupation and invasion of Georgian
territory, which has occurred over these past months.
We have to react, together with the Security Council.
As I mentioned, Georgia stands ready to cooperate
when the international community, international
observers, the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, the European Union - and the
United Nations, of course - to facilitate this kind of
ceasefire and to be bound by it.
