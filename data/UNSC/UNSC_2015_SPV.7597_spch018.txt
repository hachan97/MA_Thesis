The President: I thank the representative ofNigeria
for her leadership on the Security Council. I would like
to say that in my two years representing my country in
the Council, I have noticed that whenever Mrs. ngu
talks, everybody puts down what they are doing and
listens to her. I wish I had what she has. I guess I will
have what she has been eating or drinking. She just
exudes wisdom, to her team and to her colleagues. It
has been a great privilege for me. I will say more about
Nigeria when we close.
