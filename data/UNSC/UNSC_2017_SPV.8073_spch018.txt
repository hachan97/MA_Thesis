Mr. Seek (Senegal) (spoke in French): We are
disappointed that the Security Council was not able to
maintain its unity to adopt a technical renewal of the
mandate ofthe Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) for
another year.

Senegal voted in favour of draft resolution
S/2017/884, as we are convinced of the central role that
the Mechanism plays in the framework of the global
non-proliferation architecture and of its efforts to
independently, impartially and objectively implement
its mandate under resolution 2235 (2015), which was
renewed through the unanimous adoption of resolution
2319 (2016).

It is important to recall that the mandate consists
of identifying, to the greatest extent possible, the
individuals, entities, groups or Governments that
have perpetrated, organized or ordered the use of
chemicals - including chlorine gas and all other toxic
chemical products - as weapons in Syria, as well as
those who have participated in such actions in any
way. The continued allegations of the use of chemical
weapons in Syria further demonstrate the need for
the JIM. to pursue its work, particularly in a context
in which non-State actors, including terrorist groups,
could obtain such weapons of mass destruction.

The delegation of Senegal is hopeful that following
the publication within 48 hours of the report of the
Mechanism, the Council will be able to return to the
essential issue of accountability for the unacceptable
use of chemical weapons. We therefore reiterate our
appeal for a return to the spirit of consensus that
prevailed during the adoption of resolutions 2118
(2013), 2235 (2015) and resolution 2319 (2016), which
led to tangible progress in addressing the issue of the
problematic use of chemical weapons in Syria.
