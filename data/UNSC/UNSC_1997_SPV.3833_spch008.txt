Mr. Gomersall (United Kingdom): The problems of
Tajikistan are overdue for a solution. We are encouraged by
the progress which has been reported by the Secretary-
General in the implementation of the General Agreement on
the Establishment of Peace and National Accord in
Tajikistan. We consider that the exchange of prisoners of
war and the process for the return of refugees are
particularly important and urgent items.

We commend the parties in Tajikistan for their
commitment to the peace process and urge them to
continue to cooperate with each other and with the United
Nations to ensure rapid progress on what is an ambitious
timetable.

My delegation also commends the efforts of the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General, who has
been working in extremely difficult circumstances.

The draft resolution before us underlines the
international community's commitment to helping the
people of Tajikistan towards the rehabilitation of their
country. But the principal responsibility for this, of
course, lies with the Tajik parties themselves.

Although we accept the Secretary-General's
recommendations for an expansion of the United Nations
Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) and will
vote in favour of this draft resolution, we remain
concerned about the security situation in Tajikistan. The
formation of the joint security unit is a welcome and
necessary step, but we shall need to follow closely
developments which might affect the security and safety
of UNMOT personnel and their ability to carry out their
mandate effectively.

My delegation would also like to welcome the
Secretary-General's initiative in holding a donor
conference in Vienna in two weeks' time. The United
Kingdom will be represented at that conference.
