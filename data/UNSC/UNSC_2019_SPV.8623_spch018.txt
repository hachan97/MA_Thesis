Mr. Ndong Mba (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in Spanish): We abstained in the voting on the two draft
resolutions S/2019/756 and S/2019/757 to demonstrate
our dissension over the lack of understanding and unity
within the Security Council on an issue that is so vital
and important as the Syrian conflict, in which many
human lives - including those of civilians, women,
children, pregnant women and people with special
needs - are being sacrificed. That division and lack
of understanding are all the worse given our efforts to
address a grave humanitarian situation, such as that
currently prevailing in Idlib.

We had hoped that the negotiations would broaden
and deepen on the draft resolutions presented by the
penholders in a spirit of flexibility and good will,
taking into account, above all, the critical situation of
the civilian population in Syria, especially in Idlib, and
setting aside the geostrategic interests of countries with
major influence on the parties to the conflict. We had
hoped to repeat our experience of a few days ago with
the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan,
when we were ready to give up the relevant draft
resolution for lost until, happily, we reached an
understanding and voted unanimously. Why can we not
do the same with the humanitarian situation in Syria
and the chemical weapons in that country?

That is why we decided to abstain in the voting on
both draft resolutions.
