Mr. Berrocal Soto (Costa Rica) (interpretation from Spanish): I congratulate you, Mr. President, most
particularly on your proper and skilful leadership of this
debate and on your immediate convening of this meeting of
the Security Council to consider the delicate situation in the
Middle East.

For several years now, Costa Rica has provided its full
support to the peace process in the Middle East, and we
welcomed with particular pleasure the peace agreements
signed in Oslo by Israel and the Palestinian Authority,
which demonstrated the important regional and international
consensus in favour of the pacification of this very troubled
part of the world. The path marked out in Oslo is the path
of peace. This is why Costa Rica was deeply disturbed to
learn of the regrettable and reprehensible events in the city
of Jerusalem and in Ramallah, Nablus, Bethlehem and
Gaza. In this context, Costa Rica feels great sorrow over
the violent events that have taken place and expresses its
profound concern over these events, which most assuredly
do not contribute to the appropriate climate of confidence
for full implementation of the important commitments
taken on in Oslo.

Costa Rica urges and encourages all the parties
concerned - particularly the Government of Israel and
the Palestinian national authority - to make every effort,
as soon as possible, to return to the negotiating process
on the implementation of the peace agreements. This
should include the resumption of talks between the two
parties. We also ask them to take every possible measure
to protect and ensure the safety and security of the
inhabitants of the affected areas.

In conclusion, Costa Rica expresses its condolences
for the victims of these events and its full solidarity with
their families. We also wish to reiterate the fundamental
principle that holy places must be respected.
