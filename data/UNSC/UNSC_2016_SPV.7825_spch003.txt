Ms. Sison (United States ofAmerica): We have heard
the representative of Russia talk about conversations
with the United States. Russia says that it was on the
cusp of reaching a deal with the United States to allow
for some resolution of the situation in eastern Aleppo,
and that the draft resolution (S/2016/1026) before us
undermines the negotiation. That is a made-up alibi.

The United States, including Secretary Kerry, has
continued our bilateral conversations with Russia to try
to find some way to relieve the suffering around eastern
Aleppo. However, we have not reached a breakthrough
because Russia has been more focused on preserving
its military gains than on helping Aleppo's civilians.
Russia has many times before held out the vague
prospect of some diplomatic deal to argue for delaying
action at the Security Council. Each time Russia has
followed up its promises with yet another relentless
round of bombing, with horrific human consequences.

We remain directly engaged with key countries,
including Russia, to address the horrific situation on
the ground, but we will not let Russia string along the
Security Council while waiting for a compromise from
the Russians that never seems to come.
