The President: Could I say how much I appreciated
the style in which you proceeded to intervene in this
debate, Mr. Ambassador. This practice of a note-less
ambassador is obviously catching. I appreciated in
particular the way in which you related to the other points
that have been made in the debate, which I think helps us
move forward.

May I also say that your comments on looking at
more informal procedures in the relationship between the
Security Council and the Organization of African Unity,
and Africa in general, are very interesting. We ought to
look at that more carefully.

I would just, perhaps, finally say in response that I
have always found my civil servants extremely nervous
when I appear note-less at meetings, because they think
I might say what I actually believe.
