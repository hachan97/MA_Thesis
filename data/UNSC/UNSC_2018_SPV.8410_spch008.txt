Ms. Schoulgin Nyoni (Sweden): Sweden is deeply
concerned about the escalation in the Sea of Azov
and the Kerch Strait. Blocking maritime traffic to
and from Ukrainian ports, using military force, is a
serious violation of international law. This violation
comes against the backdrop of the illegal annexation
of Crimea and Sevastopol in 2014 and the finalization
of the bridge across the Kerch Strait earlier this year,
both blatant violations of Ukraine's sovereignty and
territorial integrity.
We fully support the Ukrainian request for a
Council meeting in the light of the latest developments.
Any other country would have done the same and would
have expected the issue to be handled as the threat to
international peace and security that it constitutes.

Russia's unwarranted and disproportionate checks
of ships passing through the Strait has been ongoing for
months already. We regret that Russia has ignored the
calls from Ukraine and the international community
to abide by international law and allow free passage
through the Kerch Strait and instead has opted to
escalate the situation further. In a situation that is
already tense, this behaviour is deeply irresponsible.

As a first step, the naval vessels and crew members
who have been detained should be immediately and
unconditionally released. This would be an important
step towards de- escalation.

We urge Russia to act in accordance with
international law. Let me underline that there can be
no doubt that Russia has international legal obligations
to refrain from blocking access to Ukrainian ports
in the Azov Sea and elsewhere, as well as to respect
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
principles and commitments. We call on Russia to
respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity
and its navigational rights.
