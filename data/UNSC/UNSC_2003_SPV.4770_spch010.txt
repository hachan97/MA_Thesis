Mr. Wang Yingfan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
The Chinese delegation would like to thank Mr. Annabi
for his briefing on the latest developments in Kosovo.

Four years ago the Security Council adopted
resolution 1244 (1999), laying the basis for a
comprehensive settlement of the Kosovo question.
Accordingly, the Provisional Institutions of Kosovo
should scrupulously fulfil their obligations. Like other
countries, we call on the Provisional Institutions to
continue to take effective action to crack down on
crime, guarantee the rights and interests of ethnic
minorities and promote economic development, as well
as to fully cooperate with the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the
Government of Serbia and Montenegro, with a View to
the early achievement of social stability, economic
development and ethnic harmony.

China, like other countries, condemns all
atrocities and other acts of violence, which undermine
the social stability of Kosovo. The Chinese delegation
appreciates the tireless efforts of UNMIK aimed at the
restoration of stability, the establishment of the rule of
law, economic development and the promotion of
ethnic harmony. We support the "standards before
status" policy of the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General, Mr. Steiner, and the series of
measures in the benchmark process. We hope that
UNMIK will continue to effectively carry out its
mandate, satisfactorily deal with the decentralization
question and take further measures to ensure that the
Provisional Institutions fulfil their responsibilities.
