Mr. Li Baodong (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China was a sponsor of resolution 2043 (2012), which
we have just adopted. China has always maintained that
Syria's independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial
integrity - as well as the choice and will of the Syrian
people - should be respected. We have always
supported and are actively committed to promoting a
just, peaceful and proper settlement of the Syrian crisis
through political dialogue. The good offices of Joint
Special Envoy Kofi Annan constitute a practical way
out and an important channel through which to steer a
political settlement of the crisis, and he has made
positive and significant progress. We urge all parties,
including the Syrian Government and the opposition, to
cooperate fully with his efforts in order to create the
conditions for launching a Syrian-led, inclusive
political process.

We also call on the international community to
maintain its firm support for Mr. Annan's efforts and to
help consolidate the results achieved so far. We are
strongly opposed to any words or deeds that may create
difficulties for Mr. Annan in his work. The immediate
and full deployment of the United Nations Supervision
Mission in Syria (UNSMIS) is critical to solidifying
Mr. Annan's progress and promoting the full
implementation of his six-point proposal. We hope that
the Supervision Mission will fully respect Syria's
sovereignty and dignity, act strictly in accordance with
what the Security Council has authorized, adhere to the
principles of neutrality, objectivity and impartiality, and
play an active and constructive role in pushing for a
sustained cessation of violence in Syria. We also call on
the Syrian Government and other relevant parties to
support and cooperate with UNSMIS.
