The President: On behalf of the members of the
Security Council, I should like to condemn, in the
strongest terms, the cowardly and unconscionable
terrorist attack on 31 October in New York City - home
to United Nations Headquarters - that targeted
innocent civilians. The members of the Security
Council express their deepest condolences to the
families of those killed, and offer their sympathy to
the people and Governments of the United States of
America, Argentina and Belgium. I ask members to
stand for a moment of silence for the victims.

The members of the Council observed a minute of
silence.

Expression of thanks to the outgoing President

The President: As this is the first public meeting of
the Security Council for the month of November, I should
like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Security
Council, to pay tribute to His Excellency Ambassador
Francois Delattre, Permanent Representative of France,
for his service as President of the Council for the month
of October. I am sure I speak for all members of the
Security Council in expressing deep appreciation
to Ambassador Delattre and his delegation for the
great diplomatic skill with which they conducted the
Council's business last month.
