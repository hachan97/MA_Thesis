Mr. Bouchaara (Morocco) (spoke in French): I will
be very brief. My delegation has asked for the floor
again to make the following statement.

Morocco regrets that a State member of the Council
mentioned the question of the Sahara this morning,
drawing a dubious parallel between it and other
situations around the world. That same member State
had drawn a similar parallel in an equally inappropriate
manner during a previous debate.

I would reiterate that drawing a parallel between
the question of the Sahara and other situations is
completely unwarranted and politically motivated and
does not in any way take into account the disparate
realities of these situations. It is dishonest in both form
and substance to compare questions of a fundamentally
different nature.

Morocco respects the rule of law and has institutions
to promote and protect human rights, the credibility and
effectiveness of which are internationally recognized.
Each situation has its own unique characteristics and
thus requires tailored responses. To draw parallels
of this type is to simply display great ignorance of
Morocco's history. It is thus wrong and careless to
seek, in spite of everything, to compare the question
of the Sahara to other situations while denying with
astonishingly bad faith the historical, legal and political
realities that distinguish them.
