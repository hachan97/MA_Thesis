Mr. Matuszewski (Poland): The Polish delegation
stated its position on the issue before us on 31 January
1996 and on 26 April 1996.

My country condemns terrorism in all its forms.
Having examined very carefully the report of the
Secretary-General of 10 July 1996, as well as other relevant
documents, we have to concur with the conclusion that the
Government of Sudan has failed to comply with the
demands contained in resolutions 1044 (1996) and 1054
(1996).

We therefore urge that Government to take immediate
and effective steps to fulfil its obligations, including
measures which would ensure that the persons suspected of
committing an attempt on the life of President Mubarak of
Egypt are brought to justice, as stipulated in this Council's
resolutions and in the documents of the Organization of
African Unity.

The resolution the Security Council has just adopted
confirms that the international community expects the
Government of Sudan to fully comply with the demands of
this Council and of the Organization of African Unity. It is
also evidence of this Council's determination in pursuing all
possible options to influence the behaviour of those who
endanger international peace and security by supporting
terrorism. By postponing the decision on the actual entry
into force of sanctions, the resolution provides the
Government of Sudan with a chance to take the necessary
action. We sincerely hope that this chance is not to be
lost.
With this in mind, the Polish delegation voted in
favour of the resolution.
