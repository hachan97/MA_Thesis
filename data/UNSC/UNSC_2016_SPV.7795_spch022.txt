The President (spoke in Russian): 1 shall now
make a further statement in my national capacity as the
representative of the Russian Federation.

I thought my colleague's memory was a little
better than that. Was three paragraphs all that the event
deserved? This is in fact the second version produced
in the wake of our comments. But in any case, it was
not a serious effort. We can talk about that another
time. I hope, finally, that we can use the same format
to talk about what is going on in Yemen and Iraq, in
a useful discussion. Look, here we have Uruguay,
setting a courageous example, always speaking first in
public meetings. Let us discuss things. On 31 October,
Mr. Ismael Ahmed will be here and we can talk about
what is going on in Yemen in a public meeting.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.
I give the floor to the representative of the Syrian
Arab Republic.
