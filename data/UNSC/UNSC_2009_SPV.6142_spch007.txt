Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We are grateful to the Permanent
Representative of Japan, Ambassador Takasu, for the
regular quarterly briefing on the work of the Security
Council Committee established pursuant to resolution
1737 (2006) and for the work that he has carried out at
the head of that Committee. We note that in the
reporting period, the Committee has operated in full
accordance with resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007)
and 1803 (2008).

Our view is that the Committee will continue to
be guided in its work by the spirit and letter of these
resolutions and by the primary goal of effectively
monitoring the Iranian programme through diplomatic
means and negotiations, on the basis of the proposals
put forward by the six. Currently, the Russian
Federation, with other members of the six, is working
towards ensuring that dialogue with Iran would be
resumed as quickly as possible. In this context, it is
important that all six States maintain their commitment
to the primary goal, which is to assist the International
Atomic Energy Agency in establishing the fact that
there are no military aspects to Iran's nuclear
programme.
