Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): I
regret the need to rebut some of the comments made by
the Permanent Representative of Iran, but his distorted
account of history - including personal attacks on my
country - simply demean him and seem designed as
an excuse for Iran not to respond to international
concerns about its nuclear programme.

The attacks on the integrity of the Security
Council are an insult to my colleagues here now and
over the past four years. I hope that, on more sober
reflection, Iran will respond honestly to the concerns
that are expressed in the resolution that has just been
adopted and that have been expressed by this Council
over the past four years on Iran's nuclear programme,
and that it will engage seriously in negotiations on that
programme.
