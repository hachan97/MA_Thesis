Mr. Sithole (South Africa): I would like to thank
you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting on the
humanitarian situation in Syria. We also thank Under-
Secretaries-General Rosemary DiCarlo and Mark
Lowcock for their briefings.

South Africa condemns the escalation of violence,
particularly in north-west Syria, and the unnecessary
loss of innocent lives. The attacks on civilians and
civilian infrastructure, particularly the destruction
of schools and health facilities, are unacceptable and
must be strongly condemned. It is worrying to note that
owing to the stark increase in violence, 16 humanitarian
agencies have suspended their activities in the area. The
people of Syria, particularly in the Idlib area, are in dire
need of humanitarian assistance. South Africa calls on
all parties to uphold international humanitarian law and
protect civilians, and would like to remind them of their
obligations under international humanitarian law and
international human rights law to protect civilians and
civilian infrastructure.

We urge the relevant parties to cease hostilities
immediately and make the necessary provisions to
enable the resumption of humanitarian activity. We wish
also to emphasize that counter-terrorism actions cannot
be undertaken at the expense of innocent civilian lives
and that any such actions should be taken only within
the parameters of international law. My delegation
supports the Secretary-General's call for all parties
to respect international humanitarian law and the
protection of civilians, and further urges the parties to
the September 2018 memorandum of understanding on
the stabilization of the Idlib de-escalation area to adhere
to the commitments contained in the memorandum.
