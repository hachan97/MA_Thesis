Mr. Shen Guofang (China) (interpretation from Chinese): The illegal flow of arms has already seriously
undermined the security and stability of Rwanda and the
whole Great Lakes region, and also created a tragedy in
which many people were killed. The international
community should adopt precise measures to curb this flow.
The reactivation of the International Commission of Inquiry
is one measure for prohibiting the provision of arms to the
former Rwandan government forces. Given the interests of
the parties concerned and the need to maintain security in
the area, China feels positively about the resumption of the
work of the Commission. The Commission did a great deal
of work in the past and put forward some
recommendations. We express our appreciation for this.

The draft resolution before us today is very important.
China hopes that this draft resolution can lead the
Commission, on the basis of its investigations, to make
effective and feasible recommendations to the Security
Council so as to ensure that the provisions of the relevant
Security Council resolutions can be effectively
implemented.

The successful implementation of the Commission's
mandate depends to a large extent on the support and
cooperation of the countries concerned. We hope that the
Commission can conduct close consultations with the
countries concerned and also hope that the countries in
the Great Lakes region, along with other interested
countries, can provide information and the necessary
assistance to the Commission.

Curbing the illegal flow of arms requires the
adoption of effective measures by the countries concerned
and an integrated approach. We hope that all the countries
concerned will make vigorous efforts in this regard.
