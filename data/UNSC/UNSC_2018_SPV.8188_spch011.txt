Ms. Wronecka (Poland): We highly commend
the work of Sweden and Kuwait as co-penholders on
the humanitarian resolution for Syria - resolution
2401 (2018) - who did their best to accommodate the
concerns of all Security Council members.

On Wednesday I stressed that it is the Council's
responsibility to not fail in stopping the ongoing human
tragedy in Syria, and in eastern Ghouta in particular
(see S/PV.8185). Today we have managed to reach
compromise and adopt the resolution by consensus.
I would like to thank all my colleagues for their very
constructive attitude.

However, the innocent people of Syria have waited
far too long for that. Now, all of the parties, especially
those with influence on the ground, must make every
effort to implement it. In that context, we reiterate
our call on all sides to comply with international
humanitarian law, cease all hostilities against civilians
and allow for free humanitarian access. In conclusion,
it is not only our legal obligation to act now, but also
our moral duty.
