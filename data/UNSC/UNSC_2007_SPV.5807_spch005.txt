Mr. Al-Ansari (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): First of
all, I would like to thank Mr. Verbeke for his briefing.
Qatar attaches great importance to the peaceful
resolution of the Iranian nuclear file, and we wish
therefore to comment on the following regional
considerations.
07-64858

Qatar affirms that a peaceful resolution of the
Iranian nuclear file is the ideal solution, as reaffirmed
by the Gulf Cooperation Council, meeting in Doha. We
reaffirm the full right of States parties to the Treaty on
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to the
peaceful use of nuclear energy under the relevant
provisions of the Treaty. We reaffirm, therefore, the
importance of the universality of the NPT and its
implementation for all States in the Middle East,
without selectivity or discrimination, and the
importance of strengthening confidence and preventing
the causes of proliferation, especially invisible
proliferation.

Having become familiar with the lAEA report on
Iranian nuclear activities, we welcome the August 2007
agreement on a workplan to address pending issues
between Iran and lAEA regarding the IAEA safeguards
regime. We believe that the report describes some
factors that are encouraging for the plan's
implementation regarding questions of importance to
lAEA. We call on Iran to continue down the road of
cooperation as set out in the report and to answer
IAEA'S questions, build confidence and resolve
pending issues, in particular because the report agrees
with lAEA statements that the results of the inspections
and inventory accord with information presented by
Iran and described in the report. Moreover, lAEA is
waiting for answers from Iran regarding a number of
pending issues. We hope that those questions will be
dealt with in the near future.

Finally, we call upon all parties to adopt a policy
of restraint and calm and not to attempt to influence the
independence of the IAEA, in order to enable it to
carry out its responsibilities.
