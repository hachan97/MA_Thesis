Mr. Akahori (Japan): On the occasion of the first
meeting of the Security Council for this month, Japan
would like to congratulate China on its assumption of
the presidency for the month of April. We promise you,
Sir, our full cooperation.

Japan welcomes the unanimous adoption of
resolution 2279 (2016). I would like to thank France for
taking the lead in preparing the resolution, of which
Japan is pleased to be a co-sponsor.

The United Nations should work together with the
African Union and the East African Community to find
a solution to the Burundian crisis through dialogue.
We must stop violence and human rights violations
in Burundi. As members of the Security Council, it is
our responsibility to take action to prevent a further
deterioration of the situation on the ground. We expect
that the United Nations enhanced presence in Burundi
will contribute to strengthening an adequate channel
between the Security Council and the Burundian
parties. We consider today's adoption an important
first step. We look forward to discussing, seriously and
actively, the options that will be presented to us by the
Secretary-General.
