Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): Ijust wanted to
comment on the Syrian representative's last statement,
in which he said that the Syrian Arab Republic will
spare no effort to arrive at a political solution. That
is obviously a welcome statement. I would like to ask
him if he could tell the Council, or is willing to say
today, that Syria will put the same amount of effort
into engaging with the Special Envoy of the Secretary-
General for Syria and with the Council in order to take
concrete steps to get the Geneva process to work and
to get a constitutional committee off the ground. If
Syria were able to make that commitment today in the
Chamber, I believe that would unlock a lot of things for
the Council.
