The President (interpretation from Spanish ): I thank
the representative of Norway for his kind words addressed
to me.

There are a number of speakers remaining. In View
of the lateness of the hour, and with the concurrence of
the members of the Council, I intend to suspend the
meeting now.

The meeting was suspended at 1.35 p.m.
