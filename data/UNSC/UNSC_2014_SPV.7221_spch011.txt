Mr. Naber (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): On behalf
of the Government and the people of the Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan, allow me to extend my heartfelt
condolences to the Governments and families of the
victims of the Malaysian airliner downed over eastern
Ukraine as a result of a criminal act.

My delegation welcomes the Council's unanimous
adoption of resolution 2166 (2014), which we sponsored
and voted for out of our deep belief in the importance
of unveiling the truth surrounding this incident by way
of a thorough independent international investigation,
with a view to holding the perpetrators of this crime
accountable and to attain justice.

In addition to the impact of bringing closure to the
victims' families, we underscore the importance of all
the relevant parties cooperating in the implementation
of the resolution as soon as possible. The site of the
incident must be safeguarded and the investigators
must be granted unfettered access free of manipulation.
