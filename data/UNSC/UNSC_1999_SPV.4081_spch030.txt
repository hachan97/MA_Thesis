The President: I should like to thank Security
Council members for entering into the spirit of brevity that
we have tried to foster and to suggest that they have
provided good examples for non-Council members. I will
try to expedite the introductory formalities, so non-Council
members may wish to be ready to speak very quickly after
their predecessor has spoken.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Algeria. I invite him to take a seat at the
Council table and to make his statement.
