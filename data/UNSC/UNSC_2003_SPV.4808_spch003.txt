Mr. Negroponte (United States of America): The
text that we have just adopted as Security Council
resolution 1500 (2003) deals with two specific issues:
the Governing Council of Iraq and the United Nations
Assistance Mission for that country. In its expression
of support for the Governing Council of Iraq, the
resolution hastens the day when the people of Iraq will
be in full command of their own affairs - a condition
that they have not known for some three decades.

When the Governing Council representatives
came to speak before the Security Council on 22 July,
they took an important step in the process of reaching
out to the international community to communicate
their dreams and aspirations for the Iraqi people and,
equally important, their plans to achieve those
aspirations. Through the resolution that we have just
adopted, the Security Council has made clear that we
heard the Governing Council's message and that we
will work with it as a broadly representative partner -
a partner with which the United Nations and the
international community can engage so as to support it
in its endeavours to build a better Iraq.

The resolution helps pave the way towards the
peace, stability and democracy that the long-afflicted
Iraqi people so richly deserve. It also sends a clear
signal to those who oppose the political transformation
under way in Iraq that they are out of step with world
opinion. In this resolution we endorse again the vital
role that the United Nations is playing in Iraq. The
Secretary-General recommended the creation of a
United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq to better
enable the United Nations to fulfil its responsibility
under resolution 1483 (2003); we fully support the
Secretary-General's request.
