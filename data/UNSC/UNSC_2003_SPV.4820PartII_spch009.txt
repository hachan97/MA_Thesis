Ms. Menendez (Spain) (spoke in Spain): We too
recognize the presence of family members of the victims
of the tragic terrorist attacks.

Spain welcomes the adoption of resolution 1506
(2003). It not only ends the alienation of a country like
Libya from the international community, but it also
reflects recognition of an improvement in the relations of
that country with the international community. For a
country like Spain, which is so clearly committed to the
fight against terrorism, the act of proclaiming the
renunciation of terrorism as an instrument of political
action is a source of great satisfaction.

The assumption of responsibilities by the Libyan
regime has also made possible the circumstances
necessary for the adoption of this resolution.

We therefore welcome the lifting of the sanctions
regime against Libya, which demonstrates that an aspect
of international tension has been overcome and which
should prompt us to continue to strive for the resolution
of other conflicts.
