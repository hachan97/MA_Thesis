Mr. Mantovani (Italy): My delegation was
honoured to coordinate the process that has led us to
the adoption of today's resolution. I wish to thank all
delegations for the invaluable contributions made
throughout the process.

The adoption of the resolution is an important
signal of the Council's cohesion on a critical issue at a
critical juncture. In extending the mandate of the
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), the
Security Council is reiterating its full support for an
operation that, in the words of the Afghan Foreign
Minister, "has played a key role" in promoting security
and stability in Afghanistan.

In the same letter, the Afghan Government
expressed its hope that the Security Council would
continue to reflect the paramount importance of
fulfilling ISAF's mandate. To answer that call, my
delegation tried to reflect in the text all the daunting
and emerging challenges that ISAF has faced since its
expansion throughout the country. In our view, it is
particularly important that, by the resolution, the
Council is sending a signal of strong attention to all the
aspects surrounding ISAF's operations. The concept of
a comprehensive approach combining military,
political and economic efforts requires such attention.

In the resolution, we have not hesitated to address
politically sensitive issues. That has made the process
07-51075

more complex than in previous years, but we feel
rewarded by the outcome. We are convinced that in
refusing to ignore the challenges, the Council has lived
up to its responsibility as mandating authority for the
operation.
