The President (spoke in French): I wish to remind
all speakers to limit their statements to no more than
four minutes in order to enable the Security Council
to carry out its work expeditiously. We still have
50 speakers on the list. Delegations with lengthy
statements are kindly invited to circulate their texts in
writing and deliver a condensed version when speaking
in the Chamber. I would like to appeal to speakers to
deliver their statements at a reasonable speed so that
interpretation may be properly provided.

I now give the floor to representative ofKazakhstan.
