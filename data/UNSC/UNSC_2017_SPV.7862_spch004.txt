Mr. Bermudez (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish):
At the outset, Uruguay would like to thank the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General,
Mr. Mohammed Ibn Chambas, for his briefing. At the
same time, we would like to congratulate him on his
work as head of the United Nations Office for West
Africa and the Sahel.

We furthermore wish to congratulate those
countries of the region that have made a commitment
to democracy and to political dialogue, such as Benin
and Ghana. We also hope that the electoral process in
Guinea will unfold normally over the coming months.

The role played by Senegal throughout 2016 as
coordinator and mediator with respect to the crises
in Mali, Guinea-Bissau and the Gambia is also worth
highlighting. Furthermore, and as we expressed
yesterday in this Chamber (see S/PV.7861), we welcome
the progress being made in terms of security by
countries in the Lake Chad basin, which have scarce
resources and face a terrorist threat that is destabilizing
and threatening the region. That notwithstanding, they
have spared no effort in the fight, and have obtained
praiseworthy results. Nevertheless, the terrorist threat
in the region should not be underestimated, including
in the Sahel region, where the crisis has worsened,
demanding the attention of the Security Council on
various occasions.

Uruguay is principally concerned by the political
situation in the Gambia and in Guinea-Bissau, the
political leaders of which are not respecting existing
constitutional legal frameworks. Neither are they
demonstrating respect for their social commitments
or upholding the responsiblities given them by their
citizens. In that regard, we welcome the mediation
efforts being led by the Economic Community of West
African States and the countries of the region. We
invite the Presidents of both countries to work towards
finding a peaceful solution to that political impasse.
