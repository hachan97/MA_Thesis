Mr. Apakan: I wish to thank the Security Council
for giving us this opportunity to address it.

The implementation of the Minsk agreements is
important. From the security prospective, however,
the first, second and the third provisions of the Minsk
agreements are very much related to the ceasefire,
the withdrawal of heavy weapons and addendum-
proscribed weapons.

We hope to re-instate the ceasefire in the coming
days. We believe that will give us space to pursue
disengagement, de-escalation and confidence-building
measures on the contact line. It will also provide space
to speed up demining efforts in priority areas. I hope
that will also give us an opportunity to engage in more
ceasefire mediation on the contact line. The Council's
support for the ceasefire and for the security of the
contact line will also pave the way for progress in other
areas, in particular the humanitarian, economic and
political fronts.

Thank you again, Sir, for enabling us to participate
in this meeting.
