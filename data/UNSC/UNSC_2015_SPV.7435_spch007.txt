Mr. Wilson (United Kingdom): The United Kingdom
welcomes the adoption of resolution 2218 (2015). In
co-sponsoring it, we wish to reiterate our full support for
the Secretary-General, Special Representative Bolduc
and Ambassador Ross. We appreciate their efforts to
achieve a lasting and mutually acceptable political
solution that provides for the self-determination of the
people of Western Sahara.

Despite the efforts of Ambassador Ross, it is
clear that no progress has been made on the substance
of the dispute. This stalemate is regrettable and has
implications for the stability and security of the
Maghreb region. As the report of the Secretary-General
(S/2015/246) notes, there is a growing threat from
criminal and extremist activities in the regions adjacent
to the territory, and growing frustrations among
Saharan youth and Polisario military only compound
our concern.

Forty years after the start of this conflict, it is
clear that the status quo is simply not sustainable.
During Ambassador Ross' recent trip to the region,
all interlocutors committed to cooperating fully with
the United Nations and to finding a solution as soon as
possible. We welcome this pledge, but the parties must
match their words with actions and do everything they
can to honour their commitment and end the stalemate.

It is clear that the political future of Western Sahara
will be determined only by renewed engagements on
the part of the parties. They will continue to have the
support of the Security Council and the international
community in their efforts. But unless political will
can be found by the parties, we will be no closer to the
realization ofa political solution. It is high time for that
to change.
