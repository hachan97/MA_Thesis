The President (interpretation from Chinese): I shall
now make a statement in my capacity as the
representative of China.

China has always been concerned about the situation
in Haiti. We sincerely hope that the political situation in
Haiti will stabilize and economic reconstruction start as
soon as possible. It is out of this desire that China has
consistently supported the peacekeeping operation of the
United Nations in Haiti.

We believe that the United Nations should promptly
conclude its peacekeeping operation in Haiti, transfer the
focus of its work to helping Haiti undertake economic
reconstruction and provide the necessary assistance in this
regard. In this respect, the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP), the World Bank and other
multilateral-assistance institutions can play a leading role.

 

Considering the current situation in Haiti and the
request from the Haitian Government, China agrees to keep
the United Nations civilian police operation in Haiti, as an
exceptional case. We hope that this will allow the Haitian
National Police to be professionalized promptly and enable
Haiti to embark on the road towards stability and
development.

The Chinese delegation will vote in favour of the draft
resolution before the Council.

I now resume my function as President of the Council.

I now put to the vote the draft resolution contained in
document S/1997/931.

A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Chile, China, Costa Rica, Egypt, France, Guinea-
Bissau, Japan, Kenya, Poland, Portugal, Republic of
Korea, Russian Federation, Sweden, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America

The President (interpretation from Chinese): There
were 15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 1141 (1997).

There are no further speakers left on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of

its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 1.05 pm.
