The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as representative of
the Plurinational State of Bolivia.

Bolivia emphatically condemns the launching of
ballistic missiles and the conducting of nuclear tests by
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We call on
the country to completely, verifiably and irreversibly
abandon its nuclear programme.

We also believe that sanctions are a means and
not an end in themselves. As was agreed at the most
recent Summit of Heads of State and Government of the
Group of 77, which brings together over two thirds of
the Organization, we condemn unilateral sanctions as
violations of international law.

We also encourage all parties involved in this
situation to avoid an escalation of rhetoric and actions
that would increase tensions and put international peace
and security at risk, especially on the Korean peninsula.

We also underscore that we must reject a military
way out of this situation and we must make the most
of the resources provided to us by diplomacy, such a
dialouge and negotiation. We welcome the dual proposal
of a halt to the launching of missels and to nuclear tests
along with a cessation of military exercises.

Lastly, we call for greater participation by Council
members in responding to this and other issues ofglobal
concern when they are addressed.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

I give the floor to the representative of the Republic
of Korea.
