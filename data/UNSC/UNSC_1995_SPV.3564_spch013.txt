Mr. Kovanda (Czech Republic): This Council
expressed itself on the situation in Srebrenica and Zepa
last month, and what concerns us here today is the
aftermath of the Bosnian Serbs' overrunning of these two
safe areas - if that is the right expression.

Several thousand men and boys are missing. Bosnian
Serb authorities have been refusing to provide any
information about their fate or to allow the International
Committee of the Red Cross, or any other outside
observer for that matter, access to them. We fear the
worst, and just today these fears have been strengthened
by an important report in The New York Times and by
evidence presented to the Council earlier by the United
States delegation. These reports suggest that those
missing have become victims of one of the greatest
atrocities of this war. The possibility of several thousand
Bosnians having been butchered stirs the memory of the
Katyn forest, where during the Second World War
Stalin's murderers similarly butchered several thousand
officers of the Polish Army.

Confirmation of these reports would raise the spectre
of war criminality in its most heinous form. Abuses by
individuals occur in most wars, but wholesale murder of
thousands requires organization and orders from high-
level authorities. There is no doubt that these authorities
- that is to say, every one of the responsible individuals
- will be identified, tried by the International Tribunal,
and for ever stigmatized and ostracized by the
international community.
