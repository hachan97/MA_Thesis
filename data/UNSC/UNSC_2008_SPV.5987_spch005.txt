Mr. Terzi di Sant'Agata (Italy): I would like to
congratulate you, Sir, on assuming the presidency of
the Security Council and, at the same time, to express
our sincere appreciation to Ambassador Kafando and
his team for their excellent work during the previous
presidency.

I would like to join other members in welcoming
the adoption of the resolution, which calls for urgent
action against piracy off the coast of Somalia. My
Government is confident that the resolution will
contribute to more effective and better coordinated
international action against piracy off the coast of
Somalia, to the benefit of that country, the region and
the broader maritime community.

The European Union, as was underlined by
Ambassador Ripert, is receptive to that call and is
working exactly in that direction. My delegation would
like to acknowledge France for having spared no effort
in building consensus around the decision. Today's
unanimous adoption demonstrates that the Council is
able to take effective multilateral action to meet the
legitimate expectations of the international community.

The resolution addresses one aspect in particular,
but I would say that it is also one consequence of the
situation in Somalia. I cannot but add my voice to that
of Ambassador Kumalo in stressing the need for the
Council to effectively address the Somali crisis in all
its dimensions - political, humanitarian and security.
The victims and the wounded among humanitarian
workers have shown only yesterday how grave the
situation has become; they are further evidence of the
need to act.
