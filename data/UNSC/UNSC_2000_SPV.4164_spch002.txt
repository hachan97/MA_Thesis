Mr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): You will recall, Mr. President, that when we
discussed this matter yesterday in the consultations, I
proposed that we take a positive View of all requests
that we have received for participation in today's
meeting. That was the first proposal, and I would be
grateful if we could take a decision on it.
