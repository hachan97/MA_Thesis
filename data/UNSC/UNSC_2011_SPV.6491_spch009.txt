Mr. Li Baodong (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China is deeply concerned over the turbulent situation
in Libya. In our view, it is of the greatest urgency to
secure the immediate cessation of violence, avoid
further bloodshed and civilian casualties, restore
stability and normal order as soon as possible, and
resolve the current crisis through peaceful means, such
as dialogue. The safety and interests of foreign
nationals in Libya must be assured throughout this
process.

Taking into consideration the special situation in
Libya at this time and the concerns and views of the
Arab and African countries, the Chinese delegation
voted in favour of resolution 1970 (2011), which the
Council just adopted.
