Mr. Neumann: My name is Peter Neumann. I am
a professor of security studies Kings College, London,
and I am also Director of the International Centre for the
Study of Radicalization. I appreciate this opportunity
to talk about the causes of youth radicalization, and
I commend the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan for
holding today's debate.

I have dedicated the past 17 years of my life to
studying and understanding the process and the causes
of radicalization. It is What I have been doing day in
day out. It is what has kept me awake many nights. I
was born in Germany, and I have always struggled to
understand how people from my own country, with the
history we have and the atrocities and wars that we have
caused, how young people from my country - a very
small number, but still, some ofmy compatriots - could
still be attracted to a neo-Nazi ideology.

When I was a student, I spent a year studying in
Belfast, Northern Ireland. It was 1997-1998, the last
year of the conflict. The conflict was winding down
and peace was coming. Yet the scars of conflict were
everywhere, and I was looking for the cause.
When 9ll happened, in this city, it seemed far away
to me. But, four years later, in 2005, terrorists struck
in London, where I was by then living and working as
an academic. The terrorists who attacked London were
not from the Middle East, they were not from a zone of
conflict, they were from England. They had bee been
born in England, they grew up and went to school there,
they had British passports and they spoke English with
a better accent than I do, even when I try. What made
them do it?

Let me say straightaway - and I am now speaking
as an academic - that there is not a single reason why
young people radicalize. There is not a single root
cause. Radicalization is a process. It is the process
whereby people, often mostly young people, turn to
extremism - sometimes Violent extremism. It is a
process that can occur in any society, and as such it
does not have a specific cause. It is conflicts that have
causes.

If you make a list of every grievance expressed
in every conflict in which youth radicalization has
occurred, you end up with a very long list indeed. You
will end up with a list that includes, in essence, every
problem in the world. At that point it becomes difficult,
because - as I know and as the members of the
Security Council know better than everyone else - it
is neither possible nor realistic to expect politicians,
policymakers, diplomats or even the United Nations
to solve every problem in the world. Let me say it one
more time: youth radicalization as such does not have
one specific cause everywhere, but conflicts do.

Instead oftalking about the causes of radicalization
in general, what I would like to talk about one specific
conflict, and one specific population within that
conflict. The people I want to talk about are foreign
terrorist fighters from my continent, the continent of
Europe. They are foreign fighters who have gone to
Syria and Iraq to join the organization that calls itself
Daesh. They are mostly young people from cities like
Berlin, Paris, Stockholm and London - citizens of
our countries, up to 4,000 of them who have joined a
totalitarian organization that chops off people's heads
and burns them alive.

My colleagues and I at the International Centre
for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence
in London have been interested in these people for
over two years. We know many of them. We have
found 700 of them on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram
and Tumblr - social media platforms where they are
posting news and updates, comments and pictures. We
have spoken to nearly 100 of them - some over the
course of several months - and we have met face to
face with many facilitators, transporters, sheikhs and,
of course, the fighters themselves on the ground in the
border towns from where they enter Syria.

We know these people. We know their stories,
and we know that there is not just one story. There are
many stories. Some of them are pious, but others not.
Many have troubled histories, but some would have
had decent prospects had they stayed in their European
home countries. Some were driven by the humanitarian
suffering ofthe Syrian people; others were seeking thrill
and adventure. And, of course, many were extremists to
begin with; they had been extremists long before the
conflict in Syria started. So when it comes to their basic
characteristics and, if you will, socioeconomic profiles,
we are dealing with an incredibly diverse group of
people - more diverse than any extremist population
that I have seen. It is so diverse that it now includes, for
the first time in this particular group, large numbers
of women: 10, 15 and, in some countries, 20 per cent
females. So what do they have in common?

There is an uncomfortable truth here for my
European compatriots. However different the foreign
fighters my colleagues and I have found and spoken
to may be; however different their profiles and
characteristics, what many, if not most of them, have in
common is that they do not feel that they have a stake
in their societies. They have often felt that, because of
who they are, how they look and where their parents
or grandparents came from, they still were not part of
us, they were not European, they did not belong, and
they would never succeed in Europe however hard they
tried. And if you do not feel you belong; if you do not
feel that you are part of your society, it becomes easier
to leave and it becomes easier to hate, and it becomes
easier to go against the very society whose passport you
hold and whose language you speak.

Let me make this very clear. Feeling excluded on
its own does not explain why you become a foreign
terrorist fighter, and it certainly does not justify it.
Nothing justifies terrorism. Just because you have been
discriminated against, just because you lack economic
opportunity, or just because people insult your religion
does not automatically, by osmosis, make you go to
Syria and chop people's heads off. Ifit were that simple,
we would have not 4,000 Europeans down there, but
4 million And I thank God we do not.

There are a lot of other factors involved in youth
radicalization. An ideology needs to come in, make
sense of the grievance and channel it into a particular
direction. Groups, social dynamics and charismatic
leaders play an important role too. But what I am trying
to say is that exclusion - that sense of not feeling
you belong or part of your own society - opens your
mind. It opens your mind to an ideology that says, "The
West is at war with you; Europe is at war with you;
your country is at war with you; you cannot live among
these people; you cannot be European and Muslim at
the same time."

Because that is exactly what the recruiters are
saying; that is what Daesh videos on the Internet are
saying. And it resonates with some. It resonates not
because Daesh has magical powers of persuasion or
because the videos are produced so well. It resonates
because it makes sense of people's state of mind. It
gives them the answer they were looking for. It turns
a grievance into a cause - one that gives meaning
and significance. It is weirdly empowering, as hard as
that may be for a lot of us her today to understand. A
sense of exclusion is not what causes it, but it is the
precondition for everything that follows.

How do we stop it? There are lots of things we
need to do. There is a lot of firefighting - stopping
people from travelling, arresting them, and sharing
information. Some of these measures are outlined in
resolution 2178 (2014), which I had the honour to work
on with Ambassador Power and her team. We need to
empower young people to make their own choices as
full members of their societies, but we also need to
empower parents, especially mothers. They are our
strongest allies, and they are often the last ones who
still have a degree ofinfluence over their kids. We have
often seen how parents have managed to stop their kids
from going abroad. We need to create deradicalization
programmes that deliver tailored interventions, either
when people are on the brink of joining extremist
groups, before they travel to Syria, or when they come
back. We need to challenge extremist ideas on the
Internet, where extremists are incredibly effective and
we are not.

But firefighting is not enough. If we want to stop
this from happening again and again, we need to work
on creating more inclusive societies and more inclusive
identities. It is the toughest part of prevention; it is the
most costly and the most long-term. But we must do it,
because only if more people feel that they belong - that

they truly belong - to their European home countries,
however they look and whatever religion they practice,
only then will we succeed in reducing the pool ofpeople
from which violent extremists recruit.
