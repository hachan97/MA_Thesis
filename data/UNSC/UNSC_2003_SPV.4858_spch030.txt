Mr. Dahinden: Thank you very much,
Mr. President, for your kind words. I would also very
much like to thank the other members of the Security
Council for their positive comments and references to
my briefing and to the work of the Geneva
International Centre for Humanitarian Demining.

During this debate I have been particularly
pleased that the international mine action standards that
we are preparing under a mandate from the United
Nations have been found useful, and that many
comments have been made to the effect that they are
being well applied.

Much of what I said might have sounded very
technical to the members of the Council; but the
objectives are of course not. This is about saving lives,
permitting operations to take place properly, reducing
human suffering and promoting social and economic
development. I think we should not forget those things
when we are looking at the more technical issues.
