Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I will be brief. In
the Consultations Room just now, Mr. President, you
and the representative of Sweden made valiant attempts
at a compromise. We all appreciate what is at stake and
thank you for your and Sweden's efforts.

But, fundamentally, the United Kingdom could
not vote for the Russian text (S/2018/322) because
it does not establish an investigation into who was
responsible for the attack. It only welcomes the Fact-
finding Mission, which is already on its way. I repeat
what I said in consultations: the Fact-finding Mission
determines whether chemical weapons were used and,
if they were, which chemical weapons were used. It
does not, and cannot, establish who was responsible for
their use - and thus start on the first step on the path to
attribution and accountability. For that reason, we are
not able to support the text. It would be like watching a
fire, identifying that there was a fire, and doing nothing
to put it out.

The Russians invited us to return to the issue of
an investigative mechanism on a separate occasion. I
am afraid that the answer to that is 17 November 2017,
when Russia vetoed a joint investigative mechanism
that it had itself decided to set up.

For all those reasons, all it would have taken is
a written decision for an investigation set up by the
Security Council. Russia could not take that small
step, and therefore we were not able to support the
draft resolution. I very much regret that, but the answer
was in Russia's hands.
