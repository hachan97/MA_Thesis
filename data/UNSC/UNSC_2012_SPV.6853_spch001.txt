The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them document
S/2012/792, which contains the text ofa draft resolution
submitted by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. I
shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.

A vote was taken by Show ofhands.

In favour:
Azerbaijan, China, Colombia, France, Germany,
Guatemala, India, Morocco, Pakistan, Portugal,
Russian Federation, South Africa, Togo, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America
The President (spoke in Spanish): There were
15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 2072 (2012).

The Security Council has thus concluded the present

stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

Before concluding, I would like very much to thank
everyone for their goodwill in attending this very
special meeting. I am also grateful for the support we
received in the course of our presidency.

Our presidency has doubly been a victim of this
week's events, which not only frustrated plans for the
end of our presidency but also affected our Permanent
Mission and my own residence, which are located in
an area where there is no electricity, water, Internet
service or anything else. That is the reason I am here in
battle fatigues today.

We are endeavouring to resolve the situation at our
Mission in order to regain a modicum of acceptable
operations. The one thing we have discovered is that a
world without Internet and electronic communications
does not work. I once again thank participants for their
attendance.

The meeting rose at 3.45 pm.
