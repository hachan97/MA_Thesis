The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Mr. Morris for his presentation; indeed, the manner in
which he has addressed the myriad of concerns has
been very encouraging for us in the Council. He made
very good use of his time in terms of motivating the
international community.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 5 17.171.
