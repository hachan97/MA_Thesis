Mr. Yafiez-Barnuevo (Spain) (spoke in Spanish):
I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for having
given me the floor at this very special meeting - the
last such meeting to be held during the presidency of
Algeria and the last Council meeting at which the
departing non-permanent members have an opportunity
to speak.

The item on our agenda is briefings by Chairmen
of Security Council committees and working groups.
By chance or, perhaps, design, the four previous
speakers - the Permanent Representatives of Angola,
Chile, Pakistan and Germany - represent non-
permanent member countries that will be leaving the
Council at the end of the year. As my delegation is the
fifth non-permanent member to be leaving on
31 December, I would like briefly to express, as my
colleagues have done, our satisfaction at having been
able to work side by side with other members of the
Council in fulfilling the weighty responsibilities
involved in working in such an important United
Nations organ, whose critical role, pursuant to the
Charter, is to contribute to the maintenance and the re-
establishment of peace and security throughout the
world.

I should like to thank all the members of the
Council and, through you, Sir, the Secretariat and other
delegations that contribute to the Council's work, for
their cooperation, which we have been able to count
upon. I should also like to point out that there is life
beyond the Security Council - that the United Nations
extends far beyond the Security Council and that we
are all called upon to cooperate, in one way or another,
in the work that is expected of us to revitalize the
Organization in all of its aspects, as called for by the
Secretary-General and by the recent report of the High-
level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. Spain
stands ready to do everything possible to cooperate in
this task.
