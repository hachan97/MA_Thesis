Mr. Yusuf (Somalia): I would like begin by
congratulating you, Sir, on assuming the presidency
of the Security Council for the month of November.
I would also like to express my thanks and esteem to
the outgoing President, the Permanent Representative
of the Russian Federation, for his able guidance of the
Council's work in the month of October.

Somalia extends its deepest gratitude to the
members of the Security Council for their valuable
support in Somalia in all areas, including addressing
piracy and armed robbery off the coast of Somalia. The
robust commitment of the international community
has resulted in a massive reduction in piracy in recent
years, and we particularly welcome the recent release of
several long-held hostages and call for the release of all
remaining hostages.

We ask Member States and international
organizations for continued support to address the root
causes of piracy, as the Secretary-General's most recent
report notes:

"The drivers that have triggered piracy remain
unchanged since 2005. The lack of economic
opportunity has been identified by the Federal
Government and international partners as the
principal driver of pirate recruitment." (S/2016/843, para. 8)

Additionally, we welcome the acknowledgement
in the text that the phenomenon of illegal, unreported
and unregulated fishing in Somalia's exclusive
economic zone results in a loss of revenue and can
lead to destabilization in coastal communities. We
welcome the adoption of resolution 2316 (2016) and
want to assure the Council of our full cooperation on
all matters, including piracy.

The meeting rose at 3.10pm.
