The President: Before I return to the speakers'
list, may I read to you a statement.

I have just learned the sad news that a citizen of
the Republic of Korea, Kim Sun-il, held hostage by a
terrorist organization in Iraq, was beheaded earlier
today. On behalf of the members of the Security
Council, I wish to condemn in the strongest terms this
abominable act of terrorism against an innocent
civilian. I also express my deep condolences to the
bereaved family of the victim, as well as to the
Government and people of the Republic of Korea. In
the face of such evil, the world must stand united
against the scourge of international terrorism that
continues to plague our global community.

Role of civil society in post-conflict peace-building

The President: I will not individually invite
speakers to take seats at the Council table and invite
them to resume their seats on the side of the Council
Chamber. When a speaker is taking the floor, the
conference officer will seat the next speaker on the list
at the table. I thank you for your understanding and
cooperation.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Ireland.
