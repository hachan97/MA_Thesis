Mr. Gonzalez de Linares Palou (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): I would like to express our satisfaction at the
unanimous adoption of resolution 2213 (2015). Faced
with the crisis that Libya is experiencing, the essential
thing for Spain is unity -the unity of the entire
international community beginning with the Security
Council, unity among the countries of the region, which
have a great influence on Libya, and unity among the
Libyans themselves.

The first paragraph of the resolution is very clear.
It calls for an unconditional immediate ceasefire,
highlights that there can be no military solution for
the ongoing political crisis and calls on all parties in
Libya to cooperate with the United Nations in forming
a National Unity Government. This is the only possible
path for Libya. We do not say this only because it is a
matter of principle; it is our very pragmatic position.
We believe that an armed confrontation in Libya will
not lead to anything. United Nations mediation is
the best guarantee for stability in the country in the
medium term.

The emergence of Daesh has brought to light one of
the greatest dangers that this crisis poses ifit not swiftly
resolved: that Libya will become a new sanctuary for
jihadism. It is a strategic country which is an excellent
platform for attacks on Europe, the Sahel, the Horn of
Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. In this vein, we also
support resolution 2214 (2015), submitted by Jordan, to
combat terrorism in the region and we are pleased that
it has been unanimously adopted. We also approve the
renewal of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya
for only six months with the hope that in this time the
formation of a National Unity Government will make it
possible to change its mandate.

With this resolution we commit ourselves to
following more closely the situation in Libya. Indeed,
the Council is taking a great step forward today, and we
hope it will have a positive effect on all of the parties to
the conflict in Libya.
