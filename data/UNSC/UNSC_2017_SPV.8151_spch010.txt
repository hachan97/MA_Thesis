Mr. Bermudez Alvarez (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): For the sixth time in its two years as a
member of the Security Council, Uruguay has voted in
favour of a resolution with regard to the provocative
acts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
That underscores the gravity of the threat posed to
international peace and security.

As my delegation has already stated, the sanctions
imposed on North Korea should be the means to lead
the Government of the country to the negotiating table.
Sanctions must be implemented in a complete and
effective manner by all States Members of the United
Nations, and should have no adverse effects on the
people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
Uruguay's support of resolution 2397 (2017) is based
on the belief that the implementation of the sanctions
imposed on North Korea will cause no direct harm to
the civilian population, whose humanitarian situation
is already dire and requires the immediate attention
of the international community. We reiterate that we
must work to engage in sustainable dialogue that leads
to concrete results as soon as possible. There is no
military solution to the situation in North Korea.

Despite all the calls made by the international
community to start dialogue, it is not possible at present
to open negotiations, which are key to resolving the
complex situation. The solution for the denuclearization
of the Korean peninsula must be peaceful. It must be
reached through diplomatic negotiations that lead to a
political commitment among the parties, which must
be emphasized, without delay, before it is too late and
we end up regretting the consequences of a large-scale
disaster. The needs and legitimate concerns of all
parties concerned in the matter must therefore be met.
