Mr. Kolby (Norway): First of all, I would like to
thank the Secretary-General for his statement.

Norway deeply regrets that the Security Council
could not agree on the draft resolution just voted on.
The international community is intensively engaged in
the vital process of establishing a viable post-war order
in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There can be no doubt
about the key role played by the United Nations in
post-conflict peace-building in that area. This includes
support for refugee returns and the promotion of the
rule of law, including free and democratic elections.
Needless to say, the international community has not
given up on Bosnia and Herzegovina through this vote.
It must redouble its efforts to carry out the work on the
basis of the Dayton Accords.

We would be remiss if, on the very eve of the
entry into force of the Rome Statute of the
International Criminal Court (ICC), we did not renew,
in this Chamber, our full commitment to the new
reality of international criminal justice. Norway
continues to be a staunch supporter of the Court, which
will be formally established tomorrow. That is a
historic turning point.

We are convinced that the Statute contains
sufficient safeguards against unwarranted or arbitrary
prosecutions. It is worthwhile recalling that it can be
triggered only when impunity has been demonstrated
through lack of genuine national prosecution of mass
atrocities. The ICC thus gives total priority to national
courts.
