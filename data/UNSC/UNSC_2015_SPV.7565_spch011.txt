Mr. Barros Melet (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): We
welcome the forceful message sent by the Security
Council via its unanimous adoption of resolution
2249 (2015). All acts of terrorism are criminal and
unjustifiable. Those who provide material, intellectual
or financial support for terrorism must be prosecuted
and brought to justice. In addition to the resolution we
have just adopted, there is an urgent need to implement
all of the Council's relevant resolutions, especially
resolutions 2170 (2014), 2178 (2014) and 2199 (2015).

Combating terrorism must take place in line
with the obligations flowing from international law
and the Charter of the United Nations. Similarly, the
international community must contribute to identifying
and overcoming the causes and conditions that give rise
to terrorism and violent extremism, which cannot be
defeated solely via military means.

Lastly, I would like to categorically state that
Chile will continue to support global efforts against
terrorism, in the Security Council and all the other
competent forums and organizations.
