Security Council must do its utmost to be able to follow and discuss the ongoing developments in the world despite the current situation. Among others, it is essential to continue with the regular meetings on the Middle East, as the developments unrelated to the COVID-19 are ongoing in parallel. The most important goal should be keeping the momentum alive for moving towards peace and to refrain from actions that undermine it, in the spirit of the Security Council resolution 2334 (2016). We urge the parties to start negotiations and we welcome continued efforts in this regard. It is essential to stress that starting the negotiations would not meanignoring the internationally agreed parameters and that the outcome should be a negotiated solution agreed by both parties. The advancement of settlement development by Israel in several areas in East Jerusalem and around it is worrying, especially in the El area. Our position on settlement activity remains the same, it is illegal under international law and undermines the prospects for peace process. The biggest immediate worry is, of course, the risk of COVID-19 spreading in Gaza. It is important that Israel and Palestine continue their cooperation regarding preparedness to crisis. It is positive that the overall security situation in Gaza has remained calm since February, although the latest rocket attack last Friday indicates continued instability. We urge the parties to refrain from further violence and focus on the common fight against the virus.
