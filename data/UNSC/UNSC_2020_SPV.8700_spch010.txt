Mr. Singer Weisinger (Dominican Republic) (spoke in Spanish): The Dominican Republic voted in favour of resolution 2504 (2020), submitted by the co-penholders, for the renewal of the cross-border humanitarian assistance mechanism in the Syrian Arab Republic. Despite the fact that we have been able to maintain the mechanism, we cannot fail to highlight a few aspects thereof. First, the elimination of two important crossings, Al-Yarubiyah and Al-Ramtha, based on_ political rather than humanitarian motivations should definitely prompt us to think about this issue very carefully. The Dominican Republic voted in favour of the draft resolution despite the possible consequences that could arise from that decision because we believe that even operating on a partial basis, the mechanism can still save the lives of millions of people. We wish to conclude by acknowledging the flexibility shown by delegations in the Council, and we would ask that later, when we address this item once again, we keep at the forefront of our concerns the need to help the Syrian people as directly as possible and, on the basis of dialogue and in the framework of multilateralism, meet our collective commitment to defending and protecting at all costs the most vulnerable populations.
