The President: I thank the representative of Nigeria
for his kind words addressed to me.

May I say from the Chair and the presidency how
much we appreciate the leadership that President Obasanjo
is giving to the rebuilding of Nigeria.

The next speaker is the representative of Japan. I
invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make
his statement.
