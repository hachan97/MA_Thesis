Ms. Power (United States of America): In recent
months, the Council has met more than a dozen times
regarding the situation in Ukraine. Time and again, we
have urged for respect for Ukraine's territorial integrity,
adherence to international law, and steps to reduce
tensions and de-escalate the crisis. Just this Tuesday,
we met to discuss Russia's inexcusable failure to fulfil
its obligations under the 17 April Geneva agreement
(see S/PV.7l65).

Russia is pushing two monumental falsehoods
right now. The first falsehood is that the Ukrainians are
carrying out a large-scale, uncontrolled, violent attack
on unarmed civilians. That is false. The Ukrainian
Government is carrying out a targeted effort to contain
Russian-sponsored paramilitary violence emanating
from Sloviansk, in an effort to deliver security for
Ukrainian citizens. There is horrible violence in
eastern Ukraine, and that violence is coming, as it has
been for weeks now, from Russian-directed agents
and paramilitaries and their associates. The second
monumental falsehood is that the Russian Federation is
deeply concerned about the instability in the east. The
rest of us are deeply and sincerely concerned by that
instability. But despite all its rhetoric, Russia cannot
be, because Russia is causing the instability. This
expressed concern is cynical and disingenuous, and
meant only to distract us from the reality that is playing
out before our eyes.

Today I want to focus on one main point. From
the outset, the Government of Ukraine has sought to
resolve all issues peacefully through dialogue, both
internally and with the Russian Federation. This policy
of restraint continued even after Russia subverted
Crimea, orchestrated an undemocratic separatist vote
in Crimea, invaded Crimea and announced to the world
that it had annexed Crimea - while lying about its
intentions and even its presence in Crimea every step of
the way. As its country has been carved up, as foreign
operatives have moved into its homeland, as masses of
Russian troops have assembled along its eastern border,
and as Moscow has continued to threaten its territorial
integrity and its people, Ukraine has continuously, day
after day, shown remarkable, almost unimaginable,
restraint. It has done as the Council has asked. It
has implemented its international agreements. It has
refrained from military responses to aggression, even
as Russia proudly announced that it had annexed part
of Ukraine. Ukraine has over and over again committed
and recommitted itselfto direct dialogue with Moscow.
And yet, in return for Ukraine's reasonableness, Russia
has destabilized, threatened and terrorized.

In past weeks, the same scenario that played
itself out in Crimea has been repeating itself in parts
of eastern Ukraine: the same sudden appearance of
unfamiliar men and new armaments; the same strategy
of occupying buildings and taking control ofthe media;
the same vicious propaganda directed against the
Government of Ukraine and the same denials of Russian
involvement; and the same cries of outrage whenever
Ukraine takes a step to assert its own rights, enforce its
own laws, protect its own citizens and restore order on
its own territory.

The Ukrainian people and Government have
embarked on an effort today to reclaim one city in
the eastern part of their country. Their response is
reasonable, it is proportional and, frankly, it is what
any one of our countries would have done in the face
of that threat.

Imagine for a moment if 26,000 square kilometres
of Russian territory were seized by another country.
Would Moscow show restraint, week after week, day
after day, in the hopes that rational dialogue rather
than brute force would prevail? How would President
Putin respond, if parts of his country were seized, to
requests to remove his army from those parts of the
country? Seriously, there is some irony in Russian
demands, given the manner in which it would deal with
separatism within its borders.

It has been 63 days since Russia began its campaign
to annex Crimea, and for 63 days, day after day, the
Ukrainian Government has chosen peace. Yet in those
same 63 days, Russia, day after day, has chosen to
pursue more territory.

Consider the following facts. Pro-Russian
separatists have seized the Donetsk railway control
centre and stopped almost all train movements. That is
an illegal act. Separatists seized control of the Donetsk
General Prosecutor's office, in a violent clash that left
more than two dozen people hospitalized. That is an
illegal act. Separatists seized the General Prosecutor's
office in Horlivka. That is an illegal act. Pro-Russian
activists beat up two Radio Svoboda journalists who
were filming a protest near the Kharkiv regional
administration building on 1 May. That is an illegal act.
We could go on and on and on and on about the illegal
acts.

All told, in 17 towns in eastern Ukraine
32 buildings are under occupation, 21 by armed
personnel. In addition, we have seen dozens of
Ukrainian public officials illegally detained, three
bodies pulled from a river near Donetsk and a group
of eight, now seven, monitors of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) abducted,
in direct defiance not simply of Ukraine's Government
but of the Council and the world community.

Alongside all of that action, we have heard the Russian
Federation building its case for intervention - outright
intervention - including President Putin saying that
eastern Ukrainian cities and Odessa were not even part
of Ukraine in the "good old days", harkening back to
the glory of Novorossiysk. And Ambassador Churkin
has taken the United Nations Charter's name in vein by
invoking Article 51 in self-defence, as activated during
the Russian takeover of parts of Georgia and relevant
here in the context of the crisis in eastern Ukraine. The
country that has a right of self-defence, Ambassador
Churkin, is Ukraine.

Russia's military intervention in Ukraine is
a clear violation of international law, and Russia
fools no one by calling its troops "peacekeepers".
Unfortunately, Russia does have a track record of using
the term "peacekeeping" as cover for unlawful military
intervention and occupation without authorization from
the Security Council. There is no evidence that the
Ukrainian Government has targeted Russian nationals
or threatened Russia in any way, in stark contrast to the
ongoing Russian actions to destabilize eastern Ukraine.
If Russia thinks peacekeeping forces are required in
Ukraine, it should come to the Security Council and
seek United Nations peacekeepers.

Those separatists are not engaged in peaceful
protest on behalf of their rights. Their rights are not
being threatened. Their ability to use their language
and have it recognized by the Government is not
being threatened. Their ability to participate fully as
voters and citizens is not being threatened. It is their
methods that have been intentionally provocative and
threatening. The separatists are not pressing their case
peacefully. They are using baseball bats, metal bars,
clubs and knives. Those are not activists, they are
armed operatives. It must stop.

Since the beginning of the crisis, the Ukrainian
Government has acted in good faith and with admirable
restraint. The area around Kyiv City Hall is now clear
of all Maidan barricades and protesters. Over the Easter
holiday, Ukraine voluntarily suspended its counter-
terrorism initiative, choosing to de-escalate, despite
its fundamental right to provide security on its own
territory and for its own people. Even today, as a it tries
to lawfully restore order, Ukrainian security forces are
operating in a cautious and restrained manner. Unlike
the separatists, Ukraine has cooperated fully with
the OSCE special monitoring mission and allowed its
observers to operate in regions about which Moscow
had voiced concerns regarding the treatment of ethnic
Russians. In addition, Prime Minister Yatsenyuk has
publicly committed his Government to undertake far-
reaching constitutional reforms that will strengthen
the power of the regions. He has appealed personally
to Russian-speaking Ukrainians, pledging to support a
special status for the Russian language and to protect
those who use it. He announced legislation to grant
amnesty to those who surrendered arms.

The fact that Ukraine has now taken some steps to
try to restore order is to be expected. It is justified. It
is what each and every one of the States we represent
would do in a similar situation, and would probably
have done far earlier. The fact that Russia has chosen
to call an emergency meeting in protest is yet another
indication that the authorities in Moscow either
underestimate the intelligence of the world community
or that they are trying to exactly replicate in eastern
Ukraine the Charade that they were responsible for in
Crimea. We are outraged by that prospect, but we are
not fooled.

Just as Russia and its pro-Russian militia allies
engage in a dramatic and dangerous campaign in
eastern Ukraine, the Russian Government is spreading
some of its most wild propaganda and fantasy stories
since the beginning of the crisis. Over the course of
the aggression, some of those entrusted with carrying
out the functions of the municipal Government and
those reporting impartially on the facts have begun to
slowly disappear. Local council members, local police
and journalists are missing and being held by armed
operatives. International observers from the Vienna
Document observation team, as the Council knows,
are being held in hostage. Those who have an interest
and a mandate to report on the truth are being silenced,
and that silence is being filled with relentless Russian
propaganda and fiction that, it seems, they hope will
justify whatever actions they decide to take.

Today's Russian Foreign Ministry ridiculous and
false statement purporting Western intervention would
not be so alarming if it did not suggest that Moscow is
looking for nothing short ofa pretext to invade. Russia
may have the power to instigate fear, to spread lies and
to sow discord, violence and disarray across its border.
It may even have the power to abuse its veto at the
Security Council. But, as we have said in the Chamber
before, it cannot veto the truth.

These are dangerous days for Ukraine and for all of
us. If there is hope to de-escalate, Russia must pull back
its troops from the eastern border of Ukraine, it must
cease its campaign of instability inside of Ukraine, and
it must work to release the international observers and
journalists who have been taken by armed men working
on behalf of Moscow's agenda.

Over the past 63 days, in the face of aggression
and annexation, the Council implored the Ukrainians
to demonstrate restraint, and they heeded our call. We
also asked Russia to stop invading its neighbour. Sadly,
it did not. For that, Russia must be held accountable.

In conclusion, I reiterate the support of my
Government for the principles of the United Nations
Charter. We continue to support the scheduled 25 May
elections, which will enable the people of Ukraine to
choose their leaders freely and fairly. We continue
to seek a peaceful, democratic, inclusive and united
Ukraine. We remain committed to a diplomatic process.

Finally and most urgently, we call on Russia to
cease its provocative acts and to fulfil the Geneva
commitments from which it has walked away.
