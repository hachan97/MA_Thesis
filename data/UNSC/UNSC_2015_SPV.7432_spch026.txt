The President (spoke in Arabic): Before moving on
to the next item, I would like to thank all the members of
the Security Council for their statements. In particular,
I would like to thank the Ministers, Ministers of State
and the Deputy Minister who have taken the trouble
to travel to come and be with us today in View of the
importance of our subject.

I now wish to remind all speakers to kindly limit
their statements to no more than four minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to circulate their texts in writing and deliver
a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber. It
is our intention to use the flashing light on the collar
of the speakers' microphones to indicate when the
time allocated has elapsed. I would also like to appeal
to speakers to deliver their statements at a reasonable
speed so that interpretation can be accurately provided.
I also wish to inform all concerned that we will be
carrying on this open debate through the lunch hour in
view of the large number of speakers.

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Sameh
Hassan Shokry Selim, Minister for Foreign Affairs of
the Arab Republic of Egypt. I would like to thank him
for having taken the trouble to travel to be with us in the
Chamber today in person.
