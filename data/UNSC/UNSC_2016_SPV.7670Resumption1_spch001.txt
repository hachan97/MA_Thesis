The President (spoke in Chinese): I wish to remind
all speakers to kindly limit their statements to no
more than four minutes in order to enable the Council
to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with
lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate
the texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version
when speaking in the Chamber. I would also like
to appeal to speakers to deliver their statements at a
reasonable speed so that the interpretation can be
provided accurately.

I now give the floor to the representative of Sweden.
