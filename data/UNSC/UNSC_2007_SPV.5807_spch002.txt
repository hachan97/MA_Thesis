Mr. Verbeke (Belgium): This is my fourth 90-
day report to the Security Council, which I am
delivering in accordance with paragraph 18 of
resolution 1737 (2006). The report covers the period
from 20 September to 18 December this year.

During the reporting period, the Committee held
no sessions of informal consultations, but carried out
its work outside the meeting room. As members will
recall, paragraph 15 of resolution 1737 (2006) concerns
notifications by relevant States to the Committee of the
intention to make or receive payments, or to authorize
the unfreezing of funds, in connection with contracts
entered into prior to the listing of persons and entities
in the annexes to resolutions 1737 (2006) and 1747
(2007), as subject to the assets freeze. During the
reporting period, the Committee received eight such
notifications.

ln paragraph 19 of resolution 1737 (2006), the
Security Council decided that all States would report to
the Committee within 60 days of the adoption of the
resolution on the steps they had taken with a View to
implementing effectively paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10,
12 and 17 of the resolution. In paragraph 8 of
resolution 1747 (2007), the Council called upon all
States to report to the Committee within 60 days of the
adoption of the resolution on the steps they had taken
with a View to implementing effectively paragraphs 2,
4, 5, 6 and 7 of that resolution.
Since I last briefed the Council, the Committee
has received two additional reports under resolution
1737 (2006) and five additional combined reports
under both resolutions 1737 (2006) and 1747 (2007).
That brings the total number of reports under
resolution 1737 (2006) to 87 and the total number of
reports under resolution 1747 (2007) to 71. All States
that submitted reports assured the Committee of their
commitment to implementing resolutions 1737 (2006)
and 1747 (2007) and to meeting their obligations as
outlined therein.

Finally, the Committee received a communication
dated 23 November from a Member State, forwarding
for the information of the Committee a copy of a letter
dated 21 November, which the same Member State sent
to the Director General of the International Atomic
Energy Agency, transmitting, on behalf of a group of
nuclear supplier countries, a list of items, end-users
and procurement agents for which those countries, in
their national capacity, had denied nuclear-related
exports to Iran.

In conclusion, as Chairman, I would like to thank
the five outgoing members of the Committee for their
cooperation.
