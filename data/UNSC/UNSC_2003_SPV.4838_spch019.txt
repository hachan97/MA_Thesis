The President: Before giving the floor to the
Judges and the Prosecutors to respond to the questions
that have been raised and make any additional
comments they might wish to make, I have four speakers
inscribed under rule 37, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Rwanda, Serbia and Montenegro and Croatia.

I therefore invite the representative of Bosnia and
Herzegovina to take a seat at the Council table.
