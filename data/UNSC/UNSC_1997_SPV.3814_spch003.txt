The President: I thank the representative of Angola
for the kind words he addressed to me and to my country.

In the interest of time, let me say to this meeting of
the Council, as I did to one previously this month, that
speakers needn't feel compelled individually to
congratulate the United Kingdom presidency on assuming
office for the month of August. I am very happy to regard
the Permanent Representative of Angola as speaking for
all on this point.

The next speaker is the representative of Malawi. I
invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make
his statement.
