The Russian Federation voted in favour of resolution 2538 (2020), on women in United Nations peacekeeping operations. We would like to express our appreciation to Indonesia, as the coordinator of the negotiations. Its efforts to strike a balance among the wide range of views of Council members made it possible to adopt the final document unanimously. We stress the importance of ensuring women's meaningful participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations, as well as equal opportunities and conditions for their involvement in peacekeeping activities. At the same time, we are convinced that this process requires a thoughtful approach, which makes it necessary to take into account the needs and security situation of each mission. The competitive advantages and required professional skills to implement mandated tasks also needs to be assessed. We also underline the importance of ensuring wide geographical representation when appointing women to leadership positions in peacekeeping operations. The primary responsibility for increasing the number of women in uniformed peacekeeping contingents lies with States. As such, we must consider the opinions and views of troop- and police-contributing countries in that regard, as well as each country's approach to staffing.
