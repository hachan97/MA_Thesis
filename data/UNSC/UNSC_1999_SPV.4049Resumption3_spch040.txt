Mr. Fowler (Canada): Thank you very much, Mr.
President, for allowing me to speak for a few seconds about
the enormous contribution that Ambassador Ibrahim
Gambari has made to our Organization and a couple of
years ago to this Council.

As Professor Gambari has just said, he has served for
10 years in this Organization. I learned only today that he
will be leaving us in a few weeks, and I thought that as this
is likely the last time he will address the Council it
behooves us to note the occasion.

The conclusion of this extremely important debate
on Africa is a very fitting occasion to note the extremely
important contribution that Ambassador Gambari has
made to the Council and the Organization, and indeed, if
I may so, the contribution he has made to Nigeria and to
the African continent. His tenure here as Ambassador of
Nigeria has covered a tumultuous period in the history of
his great nation. Throughout that time Ambassador
Gambari has represented nearly a quarter of the
population of Africa with enormous grace, poise and quiet
effectiveness.

It is also appropriate that in the course of this
debate, in which we have spent a lot of time talking about
peacekeeping, we should recall that Ambassador Gambari,
as Chairman of the United Nations Peacekeeping
Committee, the C-34, has made steadfast efforts to
streamline, modernize and enlarge the United Nations
peacekeeping performance. Indeed, the C-34 now includes
almost half the membership of this Organization, and
much of the credit for that modernization goes very
directly to him.

In conclusion, speaking personally - but I am
confident that I am expressing a view which could easily
find consensus within this Council, which is no mean
feat, and indeed well beyond - I think we can all wish
Ambassador Gambari well in whatever he chooses to do.
We will all of us miss enormously his wise counsel, an
example of which we heard just a few moments ago.
