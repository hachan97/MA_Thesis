At the outset, I wish to thank President Agius and Prosecutor Brammertz for their comprehensive reports and their presentations to the Security Council today. We congratulate them on their reappointment. South A frica believes that the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals is carrying out commendable work, and we note the significant efforts to continuously improve its functioning. As pointed out in the President's report (see S/2020/763), the coronavirus disease has had a far-reaching impact on the Mechanism's operations. In that respect, the Mechanism and its staff are to be commended for their commitment to ensuring that it remains operational during these difficult times. We acknowledge the noteworthy coordination between the Prosecution and certain States that resulted in the arrest of Felicien Kabuga in France. That underscores the importance of international cooperation to prevent suspects from evading arrest. While we have encountered a number of challenges in providing assistance to the Mechanism, we wish to underscore that South Africa is deeply committed to its international obligations in that regard and stands ready to fulfil them. We have taken note of the remarks by the Prosecutor this afternoon. We assure Council members that the recommendations made by the Prosecutor will receive the necessary attention by our Government. Regarding the most recent interaction between the Prosecutor and South Africa, I can report that the matter is being escalated to the highest authorities. A visit by the Prosecutor to South Africa will be welcome and will be in line with the escalation of that matter. Therefore, South Africa will continue to cooperate with the Prosecutor. We reaffirm our determination to continue all efforts to trace and surrender the fugitives from justice.
