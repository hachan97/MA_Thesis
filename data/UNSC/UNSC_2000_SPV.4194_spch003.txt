The President (spoke in French): I wish to
welcome the Secretary-General of the Organization of
African Unity and the representatives of a number of
African regional organizations.
With a view to making the best use of our time,
when a speaker has reached the agreed five-minute
time-limit, I shall tap my gavel as a courteous
reminder.

I now give the floor to the President of the United
States of America, His Excellency Mr. William
Jefferson Clinton.
