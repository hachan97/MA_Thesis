Mr. Vitrenko (Ukraine): Ukraine supported and
co-sponsored resolution 2348 (2017) because, in our
view, it will pave the way for further stabilization in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo. Today, the Security
Council adopted a document that is intended for the
first time to privatize tasks of MONUSCO primarily
for the protection of civilians and support for the
implementation ofthe agreement of 31 December 2016.
We hope that that approach will help the Mission to
address existing challenges in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo in a more efficient and effective manner.

The years 1970, 1977, 1984, 2006 and 2011 marked
the previous elections held in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo. We hope that in 2017 the people of that
country will again have a chance to choose their Head
of State and determine their future in a free and fair
manner. It may take a year for the long-awaited peace
and stability to appear on the horizon. We therefore call
on all national stakeholders to spare no effort in swiftly
implementing the agreement of the 31 December 2016
without any preconditions.

I cannot but join others in expressing our deep
condolences to the families of Michael Sharp and
Zaida Catalan of the United Nations group of experts
on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as we11 as
to the United States and Sweden. The world and the
United Nations lost two brave and decent people who,
while risking their own lives, tried to bring peace and
stability to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
No effort should be spared to hold accountable those
responsible for that outrage.

Finally, since this is the last day of the United
Kingdom presidency, I would like to sincerely
congratulate you, Sir, for a very successful and
productive month characterized by a masterful
British touch.
