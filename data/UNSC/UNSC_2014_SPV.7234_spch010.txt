Mr. Naber (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): I would like
to thank Mr. Ging for his briefing.

The increasing hostilities in eastern Ukraine are
a cause of concern for the Government of Jordan, in
particular in the light of the reports of the worsening
humanitarian situation and the growing number of
people killed and injured. We call on all parties to
show restraint, to calm all actors and to refrain from
engaging in any hostile or provocative act.

Jordan would like to emphasize the right of States
under international law to extend their authority
throughout their territory and to protect their citizens
from threats. In that regard, the sovereignty, territorial
integrity and independence of Ukraine must be fully
respected. We call on the Government of Ukraine to
ensure that international norms are upheld with regard
to respect for human rights in applying the law. We
reiterate the need to ensure the protection of civilians
and to avoid using civilians as targets or undertaking
any reprisals against them.

A political solution is the only way to re-establish
stability in eastern Ukraine. We therefore reiterate our
appeal to all the relevant parties in Ukraine to do their
utmost to find a political solution to the crisis, to stop
the escalation of violence and to call on combatants
to put down their weapons in order to re-establish
stability in the eastern part of the country. We also call
for the return of internally displaced persons as soon
as possible.

We urge the parties to respect the provisions of
the Geneva declaration and to facilitate access for the
United Nations human rights monitoring mission, as
well as to ensure the rights ofjournalists, in particular
in the eastern part of the country.
