Mr. Mufioz (spoke in Spanish): Given the
lateness of the hour, I shall be very brief.

First of all, I wish to express my gratitude for the
broad and strong support of so many delegations that
referred to the report presented on behalf of the
Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267
(1999), and also for the clear support for the
programme of work that we shall undertake in the
second semester.

Emerging from the various statements were very
useful practical suggestions by several delegations that
we shall take into account in our work, both in the
Committee and in our valuable support group, the
Monitoring Group. There were important
recommendations. I cannot summarize all of them,
but I should like to emphasize - only by way of
example - the importance that many delegations
attach to our Group's work of collecting information
firsthand, to the coordination that has already begun
between the two Committees - the Counter-Terrorism
Committee (CTC) and our Committee - to the idea of
focusing an investigation on informal methods of
financing terrorism and to the growing link that exists
between drug trafficking and terrorist activities and,
therefore, to the advisability of focusing on suspicious
financial transactions.

So there were a set of proposals. I remember one,
related to the establishment of case studies after
national reports have been submitted so that those
reports can be followed up by Member States
themselves. So that we can take all the
recommendations seriously into account, I should like
to ask, Madam President, that you invite Mr. Michael
Chandler to the Council table as Chairman of the
Monitoring Group - which is the basis of our work -
in case he would like to respond to some of the
questions or suggestions brought up by delegations.
