Mr. Quintero (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): On
behalf of Spain, we would simply like to add a
proposal to the CTC Chairman's statement earlier
today that in the presidential statement at the
conclusion of this meeting, a paragraph - already
distributed to Council members - be included, clearly
declaring the Security Council's and the Organization's
condemnation of all acts of terrorism. The wording is
specifically drawn from Security Council resolution
1456 (2003). We are proposing that this now-
distributed paragraph, which condemns terrorism in
explicit terms, be part of the presidential statement.
