Ms. Tacho (United States of America): After 52
years of armed struggle, the United States welcomes the
historic ceasefire between the Colombian Government
and the National Liberation Army. We congratulate the
parties on their commitment to pursuing the sustained
and lasting peace that the people of Colombia deserve.
We want to recognize the role of the Catholic church
and Ecuador, in particular, for the special role that they

have played and continue to play in brokering a longer-
term peace.
Through resolution 2381 (2017), we join other
members of the Council in supporting the work of the
United Nations Verification Mission in monitoring the
ceasefire, which will help build confidence between
the parties and prevent a return to armed conflict.
We commend the Mission for drawing on its existing
staff, logistics and resources to take on this temporary
additional task while carrying out its mandate to verify
the political, economic and social reintegration of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.

As the parties work to consolidate the security
gains from the ceasefire, we recognize the work has just
begun and that there will undoubtedly be challenges
ahead, but we look forward to hearing the Secretary-
General's update on the progress and implementation of
the ceasefire in the coming weeks. With our vote today,
the United States is proud to stand with Colombia as it
continues on the path to a more comprehensive peace.
