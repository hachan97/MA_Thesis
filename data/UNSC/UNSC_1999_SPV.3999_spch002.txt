Ms. Soderberg (United States): The United States
strongly supports the resolution before us today. This
resolution demonstrates the Council's resolve to ensure
that the sanctions imposed against UNITA are
implemented fully. Only through the implementation of
these sanctions can the international community diminish
UNITA's war-making ability and improve the prospects
for a political settlement of this conflict, a conflict that
continues to exact a painful toll on the people of Angola.

The United States welcomes and expresses its
appreciation for the initiative of Ambassador Fowler,
Chairman of the Angola sanctions Committee, who will
travel to countries in the region over the next several
weeks to discuss ways to improve the implementation of
sanctions against UNITA.

The United States also welcomes the establishment
of expert panels to investigate sanctions violations, and
we hope to provide personnel for them. However, we
must clarify our understanding of the budgetary
provisions of this resolution. We understand that the
expenses of these panels will be met primarily from a
United Nations Trust Fund established for this purpose
and through the redeployment of existing resources of the
regular budget as necessary. The United States expects to
make a contribution to the Fund, and we urge other States
to contribute similarly.
