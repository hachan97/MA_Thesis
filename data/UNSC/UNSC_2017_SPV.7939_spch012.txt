The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as a representative
of Uruguay.

Frankly, I trust that if any clear element should
emerge from Uruguay's membership of the Security
Council, it is our firm conviction that no State - much
lessaStateparticipatinginapeacekeepingmission-can
hinder missions established by the Security Council. I
think we have fought quite hard on that theme.

The adoption of resolution 2352 (2017), which we
welcome, is conditional. This will be the last extension
of the mandate of the United Nations Interim Security
Force for Abyei unless both parties demonstrate in
deed a clear and firm commitment to and offer firm
guarantees for the implementation of the Joint Border
Verification and Monitoring Mechanism. At the same
time, we will await the report to be issued by the
Secretary-General before 15 October in order to see
whether the Mechanism has reached full operational
capacity. The issue of the full operational capacity
of peacekeeping missions has also been an ongoing
concern of my delegation.

We commend Ethiopia for its efforts in Abyei over
the years. It has undoubtedly done important work in
protecting the civilian population. We thank the United
States for the transparent and open way in which it
conducted the negotiations on the resolution, allowing
it to be adopted unanimously. Let me clearly reaffirm
that the future of this peacekeeping mission is now
exclusively in the hands of the Governments of the
Sudan and South Sudan.

I shall now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.
I now give the floor to the representative of
the Sudan.
