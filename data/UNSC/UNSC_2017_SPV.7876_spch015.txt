Mr. Bessho (Japan): I thank the briefers for
providing us with a vivid update on the situation on the
ground. Japan is deeply concerned about the situation
in eastern Ukraine and its severe impact on the local
civilian population. We are disappointed that, as we
have just heard, the ceasefire is not being observed on
the ground, even as we speak.

Japan strongly calls for an immediate return to the
ceasefire regime, as expressed in the Security Council
press statement (SC/12700) issued on 31 January. Japan
takes note of the statement of the Trilateral Contact
Group yesterday calling for an immediate ceasefire,
the withdrawal of heavy weaponry from the contact
line and the provision of unhindered humanitarian
access to the affected population. The full and prompt
implementation of those measures is critical in order to
alleviate the suffering of the population and to prevent
a further escalation of the situation. Japan calls for all
the parties to act swiftly and in good faith.

Japan strongly believes that the situation in
Ukraine can be solved only by diplomatic means and
in full respect for international law, especially the legal
obligation to respect Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial
integrity and independence. The full implementation of
the Minsk agreements is the only way forward.
