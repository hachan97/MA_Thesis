Mr. Bermudez (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish):
Uruguay has just voted in favour of resolution 2327
(2016) on the mandate of the United Nations Mission
in Republic of South Sudan, as we believe it urgent
to continue renewing the commitment of the Security
Council to peace, security and stability in South Sudan,
given the delicate situation it is facing.

Although the delegation of Uruguay had no major
objection to the proposed text, we appreciate that the
views expressed by different members could have
been taken further into account during the negotiation
process. Looking to the future, and in order to avoid
last-minute emergencies and tensions, Uruguay believes
that members of the Council need to have a frank and
friendly talk leading to an improvement in negotiation
proceedings and in the quality of the product - in
other words, the resolutions that we adopt.

Furthermore, resolution 2327 (2016), through
detailed preambular paragraphs, makes a correct
diagnosis of the situation in South Sudan, which is
also in line with the findings of the Security Council
mission in September, when we had the opportunity to
make contact with the authorities and representatives of
civil society from South Sudan. The Security Council
has devoted a lot of time this year to considering
the situation in the country and is ready to carry on
doing so, but the most important thing was to provide
a mandate that ensures continuity and contributes to
some of the salient needs for the political development
of South Sudan, including the peace process, respect
for the human rights of the citizens of South Sudan,
providing the country with stability and cooperating
with the authorities in promoting the governability of
South Sudan.
