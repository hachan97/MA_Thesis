Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): South Africa remains
deeply concerned at the deteriorating situation in
Libya, which has resulted in untold atrocities and
countless loss in civilian lives. The Libyan people,
joined by the rest of the international community, have
been calling for an end to this indiscriminate use of
force. Echoing that call, the Libyan delegation,
appearing before the Council yesterday, pleaded for "a
swift, decisive and courageous resolution" to put an
end to the bloodshed and killing of innocent people"
(see S/PV.6490). The Council has responded swiftly
and resolutely to that call.

This unanimous resolution sends a clear and
unambiguous message to the Libyan authorities to end
the carnage against their people. Further, it
complements the decision of the African Union Peace
and Security Council, which strongly condemned the
indiscriminate and excessive use of force against
peaceful protesters and called upon the Libyan
authorities to end forthwith all acts of violence, in
accordance with international humanitarian and human
rights law.

We are confident that the measures contained in
this resolution will contribute to the long-term
objective of bringing peace and stability to this sisterly
nation. South Africa calls on the Government and
people of Libya to seek a speedy and peaceful
resolution to the current crisis, in accordance with the
will of the Libyan people.
