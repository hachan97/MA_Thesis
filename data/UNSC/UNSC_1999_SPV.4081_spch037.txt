The President: Can I say that I have heard some very
noble suggestions in this debate, but setting up a transfer
market for international ministerial changes is a noble one.

I very much agree with you that the litmus test for the
Security Council is the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
and we will be discussing that in detail tomorrow.
Exceptionally, in this debate, I would like to call on
Mr. Holbrooke to make a brief response to the South
African Ambassador's contribution. He is quickly making
his way back to the table.
