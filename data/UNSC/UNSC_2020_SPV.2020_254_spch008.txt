As noted already by the briefers and other Council members - the spread of COVID-19 adds another layer of complexity to the Syrian crisis. It is clear that the number of infected persons is growing, even if not reflected in the official data. As underlined by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the fragility of the Syrian health-care system, combined with the spread of the virus, will further undermine Syrian internally displaced persons. On this note, we stress that the work under Security Council resolution 2504 (2020) on cross-border aid remains vital in assisting the vast number of people in need. We note that the cross-line aid deliveries are improving, however the aid is still not reaching all the people, especially those who were formerly receiving support through the Al-Yaroubiah crossing in the north-east of Syria. The virus also threatens detainees in overcrowded prisons. We support Special Envoy Pedersen's call for a large-scale release of arbitrarily detained people and granting access to humanitarian organizations to those imprisoned. The announcement of a general amnesty is certainly a step in the right direction, but there are still a lot of unresolved issues surrounding its implementation. There have been several of these announcements in the past, with only limited results. Finally, maintaining the ceasefire in Idlib remains crucial. It is important, both for the future of the political process and preserving humanitarian access. The European Union has clearly voiced its call for a nationwide ceasefire. We repeat this here today.
