Mr. Konuzin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): At the very beginning of the transitional
period in Burundi, a law was adopted providing
temporary immunity for political crimes. I would like
to ask the representative of Burundi for what kind of
crimes immunity is granted. Is it the intention to return
to a consideration of these crimes at a later stage? I ask
this because the Burundian experience could be useful
in other country's situations.
