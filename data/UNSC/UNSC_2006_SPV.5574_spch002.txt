Mr. Bolton (United States of America): The
United States notes the request of the Iraqi Government
for the continuing support of the Multinational Force in
Iraq in helping it to face the current security
challenges, and welcomes the Security Council's
speedy adoption of today's resolution to extend for an
additional 12 months the mandate set out in Security
Council resolution 1546 (2004), as well as the
arrangements for the Development Fund for Iraq and
the International Advisory and Monitoring Board.

The Multinational Force in Iraq continues to play
a vital role in the security and stability of Iraq. It is
also working in close partnership with the Iraqi
Government towards the development of Iraq's ability
to assume responsibility for the country's security. The
United States remains committed to a unified,
democratic and prosperous Iraq, and looks forward to
the continued cooperation of the international
community for Iraq's future.
