Mr. Ibrahim (Malaysia): Malaysia welcomes the
adoption of resolution 2327 (2016) today. We thank the
United States for its efforts and Council members for
their constructive engagement, which have contributed
to bridging the gaps and achieving a more agreeable
resolution. Malaysia supports resolution 2327 (2016) as
the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS)
maintains a critical role and functions in assisting and
supporting the Transitional Government of National
Unity of South Sudan in implementing the Agreement
on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of
South Sudan, as reflected in the special report of the
Secretary-General on the review of the mandate of the
United Nations Mission in South Sudan. UNMISS,
in cooperation and coordination with the Transitional
Government of National Unity of South Sudan will
be better equipped to continue playing a pivotal and
effective role in ensuring the safety and security of the
people of South Sudan.

Malaysia therefore welcomes the decision of
the Transitional Government of National Unity of
South Sudan to fully and unconditionally implement
resolution 2304 (2016) and the Joint Communique
with the Council. We appreciate the ongoing efforts
of the Transitional Government of South Sudan and
further encourage the Government, UNMISS and
the United Nations to enhance their engagement and
partnership. We also commend the leadership role and
solidarity shown by the regional partners - namely,
the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority
on Development 4 in mediating the dialogue to restore
peace and stability in South Sudan.

Finally, we wish to reiterate that Malaysia supports
the aim of resolution 2327 (2016) to provide the
opportunity and retain the platform for the Transitional
Government of National Unity and UNMISS to continue
their cooperation and partnership for the well-being of
South Sudan and its people.
