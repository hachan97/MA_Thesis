Mr. De Mistura: protection of civilian infrastructure, a
48-hour humanitarian relief pause and authorization of
medical evacuation. He also told us that several loaded
trucks are ready and waiting to go.

We therefore need a strong and lasting consensus
among parties in the fight against terrorism, the
international community's common enemy. For as long
as the Council is divided and the International Syria
Support Group is in deadlock, terrorist organizations
will continue to thrive in Syria, attracting an increasing
number of foreign terrorist fighters and making that
country a safe haven for criminal groups. In the light
of this sad observation, the Senegalese delegation
reiterates its full confidence in Mr. De Mistura's
ongoing efforts to seek a political solution to the Syrian
crisis. War is not an option.
