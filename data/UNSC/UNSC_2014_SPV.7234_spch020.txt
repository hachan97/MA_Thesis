Mr. Ging: I would like to thank all the members of
the Security Council for their support for humanitarian
action in Ukraine and for acknowledging the excellent
work that is being done by all involved in humanitarian
action, starting with the communities themselves that
are hosting so many displaced people and extending
their generosity to them. We build on that spirit of
humanity.

Two particular questions were raised. One was
about the issue of a unified registration system for
internally displaced persons and how positive the
engagement is in that regard. I would say that we are
hoping for an early positive outcome on that issue. I
raise it here today because it is indeed very urgent and
important to our effort.

The second question was on the issue of
winterization. I think it is very important that this
point be raised because the harshness of the winter in
the region is very severe. In that regard, I can assure
Council members that winterization is at the core of
all the humanitarian plans. We are ensuring that every
effort is made to alleviate what we can expect to be a
very severe winter for those who are displaced. Once
again, I reassure Council members that it is a core
component of all of the humanitarian plans.
