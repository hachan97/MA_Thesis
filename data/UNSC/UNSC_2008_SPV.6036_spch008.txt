Mr. Weisleder (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): I
too thank Ambassador Graul for his report. I will not
refer to the substance of his report. This is one of the
most disturbing issues for the international community
as it endangers peace and stability. This issue falls,
therefore, within the responsibilities of this Council in
accordance with the United Nations Charter. I will also
not comment on the report because previous speakers
have, quite rightly, spoken about it, as has Ambassador
Grauls as Chair of the Committee.

However, I simply asked for the floor to thank
Ambassador Grauls and the Belgium Mission for the
excellent work they have done on such a delicate issue
as this is the last report that they are submitting to this
Council.
