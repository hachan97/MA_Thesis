Mr. Suescum (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): First
of all, I would like to express my thanks for the
briefings we have heard from the Secretariat today and
for the statement made by the Permanent
Representative of Georgia.

Throughout its history, Panama has lent its
support to peoples striving for self-determination, but
that should not be understood as support for any action
designed to destroy or undermine the territorial
integrity of States. We firmly believe that international
peace and security, including the credibility of the
United Nations, rests to a large extent upon respect for
that fundamental principle.

It is on the basis of those considerations that
Panama is taking this opportunity to reaffirm its
support for the territorial integrity of Georgia. We
appeal to all parties directly or indirectly involved to
do their utmost and to carry out all negotiations
necessary to ensure that that principle is respected.
