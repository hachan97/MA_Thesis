Mr. Shen Guofang (China) (spoke in Chinese):
The Chinese delegation is deeply concerned about the
negative role played by the illicit diamond trade in the
civil war in Sierra Leone.

We believe that the international community must
take strong measures to stop the illicit exploitation of
and trade in diamonds, to put an end to the rebellion of
the Revolutionary United Front and to protect the
legitimate Government elected by the people of that
country. Only in this way will we find a lasting
solution to the problems of Sierra Leone, which is the
unshirkable responsibility of the Security Council.

We believe that the draft resolution to be adopted
by the Security Council will constitute a very important
step in that direction. We note that, in its letter
addressed to the Council, the Government of Sierra
Leone indicates its acceptance of the sanctions imposed
on it. We hope that, through this measure, the
international community can help to restore peace in
Sierra Leone as soon as possible.

At the same time, my delegation believes that any
sanctions imposed by the Council should not be
indefinite. A periodic review of such measures should
be conducted and adjustments made as the situation
warrants. We are satisfied with the element of time-
bound sanctions contained in the text of the draft
resolution.
