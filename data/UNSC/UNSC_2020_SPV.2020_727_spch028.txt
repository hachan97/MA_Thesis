Greece would like to congratulate the German presidency of the Security Council as well as the Dominican Republic on organizing today's open debate on conflict-related sexual violence. Greece would also like to thank the distinguished speakers for their comprehensive briefings. While aligning itself with the statement submitted by the European Union (annex 25), Greece would like to further highlight the devastating impact of conflict- related sexual violence, which is very often used as a tactic of war and terrorism, on international peace and security, as has been duly illustrated in the most recent report of the Secretary-General (S/2020/487). In this context, the prevailing culture of perpetrator impunity, together with the false perception of conflict-related sexual violence constituting a collateral damage of war, often negates the recognition of those subjected thereto as war victims, condemning them to invisibility, silence and further victimization. Resolution 2467 (2019) introduces a survivor-centred approach to conflict- related sexual violence, which serves as a very useful tool in assessing and addressing the specific rights, individual needs and differentiated harms suffered by those sexually violated in conflict and post-conflict settings, mostly women and girls, on the basis of intersecting inequalities. This approach allows for people-centred, holistic, gender and child-sensitive responses, thereby transforming the victims of conflict-related sexual violence into empowered survivors. Accordingly, the survivor-centred approach is fully compatible with the notion of human security, which recognizes the right of every human being to live free from fear generated by armed conflict and conflict-related sexual violence; from want caused by hunger, malnutrition, diseases and underdevelopment; and in dignity, with full respect of his or her human rights, within gender-equal and inclusive societies based on the rule of law. The multidimensional character of the human security approach is particularly relevant to the current global health crisis caused by the coronavirus disease pandemic, which has exacerbated structural inequalities and placed a disproportionate burden on the survivors of conflict-related sexual violence, especially women and girls, and has therefore had a negative cumulative effect on their personal, health, food, economic and political security. The women and peace and security agenda, which incorporates a survivor- centred approach to conflict-related sexual violence, provides a comprehensive policy framework and the impetus for empowering and giving voice to survivors, first, by focusing on prevention and measures that address and tackle the root causes of gender inequality, conflict and conflict-related sexual violence, as well as on gender-responsive reforms, awareness-raising and peace education initiatives guaranteeing non-recurrence in most cases; secondly, by prioritizing the protection of the survivors of conflict-related sexual violence, their non-discriminatory access to justice and redress, along with the accountability and punishment of perpetrators so that peace may be restored; thirdly, by placing a particular emphasis on the relief and recovery of survivors through their unhindered access to a wide range of high-quality multisectoral services that include, inter alia, medical care, sexual and reproductive health as well as psychological support; and finally, yet importantly, by advocating meaningful gender-equal representation, participation and leadership in decision-making at all levels, which is a prerequisite for gender-sensitive policies. Turning those commitments into compliance requires multi-stakeholder cooperation involving, inter alia, international organizations, States Members of the United Nations, academia, civil society, human rights defenders and women's and grass-roots organizations. It also requires effective, coherent, tailor-made and results- oriented policies at all levels, which are based on thorough gender analysis, gender mainstreaming, knowledge- and experience-sharing, as well as on sound division of labour among stakeholders. However, it requires most of all a zero-tolerance attitude towards conflict-related sexual violence along with a mind shift in understanding that the ultimate goal is not a "war without rape" but rather "a world without war", as the most recent report of the Secretary-General points out (S/2020/487, para. 16). Greece attaches great importance to eradicating conflict-related sexual violence. Having ratified the fundamental conventional documents of international humanitarian and human rights law, Greece is in the process of developing national action plans on women and peace and security and on the rights of the child, respectively, which set as a priority not only the protection of women and girls from conflict-related violations and abuses, but also their empowerment. In the light of this, Greece remains committed to joining forces with all international stakeholders in a common effort to adequately promote and protect the rights and welfare of conflict-affected women and girls. In conclusion, the women and peace and security agenda suggests that when women and girls feel secure and therefore free to develop their full potential as powerful agents of change, peace is secured. Further, this can only be achieved by giving voice, strength and resilience to survivors of conflict-related sexual violence so that no one is left behind.
