Mr. Heusgen (Germany): The statement by the
representative of Russia was a frontal attack on the
international justice system, which Germany believes
is key to reconciliation. In that context, I would like to
ask the representative of Russia three questions.
First, with regard to the Nuremberg trials, which
serve today as a point of reference for international
courts, does he consider that those trials were wrong
and should not have happened? Secondly, with regard
to the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia,
which he criticized, does he believe that it was wrong
that Mr. Mladic' and Mr. Karadzie were tried by that
court? Thirdly, with regard to his reproach of double
standards, does he acknowledge that a special court has
been established in The Hague to try Kosovo Liberation
Army fighters for possible crimes against humanity?
