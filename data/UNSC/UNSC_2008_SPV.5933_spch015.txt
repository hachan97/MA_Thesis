Mr. Belle (Belgium) (spoke in French): We
sincerely regret that the draft resolution could not be
adopted today. Although the vote reflected our
differing positions as to the means to be used, we are
nevertheless resolutely unanimous as regards the
seriousness of the situation in Zimbabwe and the goals
to be pursued. All Council members are convinced of
the need for a political transition in Zimbabwe.
Belgium was a sponsor of the draft resolution and
voted in its favour. We did so because we believed it to
be a vital incentive to achieving a negotiated settlement
in Zimbabwe.

We welcome the efforts of the Southern African
Development Community and the African Union.
However, we believe that, without pressure, there will
be no negotiation. To that end, the Council's actions in
general, and the draft resolution in particular, should
support the mediation efforts in the region. We hope
that Zimbabweans in Harare understand that we have
clearly heard their appeals and have met our
responsibilities to ensure respect for their legitimate
aspirations for democracy.
