The President: Allow me to thank the Secretary
of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of
the United Kingdom, Mr. Hammond, for his personal
engagement and collaboration on this matter. It has
really been key, together with that of Frank-Walter
Steinmeier, Laurent Fabius and company. We are very
appreciative of their help.

I now give the floor to the Vice-Minister for Foreign
Affairs of Spain.
