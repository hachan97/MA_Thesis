Mr. Oh Joon (Republic of Korea): I would like to
thank Ambassador Quinlan for his briefing on the work
of the Committee established pursuant to resolution
1737 (2006). We greatly appreciate his able leadership
and the Panel of Experts for their robust activities.
Let me begin by reiterating my Government's
support for the joint plan of action agreed between
the P5+1 and Iran last November. We welcome the
initiation of the implementation of the agreed measures
since January. We are keenly watching the negotiations
towards a comprehensive resolution of the Iranian
nuclear issue. We hope the process can have a positive
influence on other outstanding non-proliferation
issues. We also underline the importance of the IAEA's
role in resolving all present and past issues, including
the possible military dimensions of the Iranian nuclear
programme.

With regard to today's briefing, we consider it
important that the obligations set out in the Security
Council resolutions remain in full force and be
faithfully implemented by all Member States. As
highlighted in the briefing, we think the various
communications received from Member States and
international organizations indicate the importance
of the Committee's work and its role in the sanctions
regime. We look forward to the Panel's new final report
with high expectations, which will shed further light on
the implementation of the Security Council resolutions.

Finally, we note that, as mentioned in the briefing,
there are important overdue pending issues on violation
cases. There are also some recommendations from
last year's final report that have not yet been fully
implemented. We encourage all Committee members
to strengthen cooperation to find common ground
and practical solutions to move those pending issues
forward before the next report is submitted.
