Mr. Dahlgren (Sweden): Let me first say that
Sweden concurs with the statement made by the
representative of the United Kingdom on behalf of the
European Union.

Sweden will vote in favour of the draft resolution
before the Council today, which reactivates the
International Commission of Inquiry which was
established to investigate illegal arms flows to former
Rwandan government forces in the Great Lakes region.
We feel that the Commission did a commendable job
during its first period of activity, often under very
difficult circumstances, and it will have our full support
as it resumes its investigations.

The destabilizing effect of the arms flows in the
Great Lakes region as a whole remains an issue of great
concern. Reactivating the Commission of Inquiry is one
concrete step which the Security Council can take to deal
with one of the causes of the continued instability in this
region.

 

Sweden is deeply concerned at the continued violence
in Rwanda, of which the massacre at Mudende last
December was a particularly horrible example. Four years
after the genocide in Rwanda, we, the international
community, have a responsibility to do everything we can
to help the Rwandan people recover from the genocide of
1994 and to prevent the resurgence of genocidal acts. We
condemn all armed activities with such motives.

We hope that Rwanda will soon be able to move
forward towards peace and national reconciliation, towards
a democratic process, towards respect for human rights and
towards economic prosperity.

Today's decision will be an important one. Let me
conclude by expressing the hope that, when adopted, the
draft resolution will be met by the necessary political will:
the will to implement the existing arms embargo against the
former Rwandan government forces; the will to cooperate
fully with the Commission of Inquiry; and, in due course,
the will to take the necessary steps in response to the
recommendations the Commission will be asked to make.
