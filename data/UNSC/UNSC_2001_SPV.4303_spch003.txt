The President: I thank Mr. Petritsch for his
comprehensive briefing.

Before opening the discussion, I should like to
acknowledge the presence at the Council table of the
new Permanent Representative of Tunisia to the United
Nations, Ambassador Noureddine Mejdoub. On behalf
of the Council I should like to extend a warm welcome
to Ambassador Mejdoub and wish him every success in
his challenging task. We look forward to cooperating
with him in the Council's work.

I shall now open the floor to the members of the
Council.
