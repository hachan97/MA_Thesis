Mr. Cheng Jingye (China) (spoke in Chinese):
At the outset, the Chinese delegation would like to
welcome Ambassador Bolton among us. We look
forward to continuing our cooperation with the United
States delegation.

The Chinese delegation strongly condemns the
series of terrorist attacks that has taken place recently
in Iraq. We would like to express our deepest sympathy
and condolences to the victims of those attacks, to their
families and to the Government and the people of Iraq.

The maintenance of security and stability in Iraq
is a very important guarantee for the smooth
development of the current political process in Iraq.
We hope that the parties concerned can redouble their
efforts to take all possible measures to improve the
present security situation on the ground.

We have also followed with great attention and
concern the political process in Iraq. We believe that
the parties in the country will be able to act in the long-
term interests of the Iraqi people, strengthen their unity
and overcome their differences so that the constitution
can be finalized according to schedule.
