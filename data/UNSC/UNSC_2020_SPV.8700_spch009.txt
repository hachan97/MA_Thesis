Mr. Baati (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): I would like to express my delegation's satisfaction at the adoption by the Council today of resolution 2504 (2020), on the extension of cross-border humanitarian assistance in Syria. I wish to commend the efforts of the humanitarian co-penholders during their discussions, drafting and consultations with the membership of the Council, and with those who contributed to the achievement of a text that would enable the Council to break the deadlock. Tunisia supported the extension of the cross-border humanitarian assistance mechanism in a framework of consensus. It is our responsibility in the Council to save lives and alleviate the human suffering of those in need in Syria. We must demonstrate a united front so that we will not fail them. It is true that we did not adopt the resolution unanimously, but we believe that we were able to guarantee the continued delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in need in Syria, and that is what matters to us. We stress that putting an end to the humanitarian suffering of the brotherly people of Syria will require a lasting and comprehensive ceasefire there as well as urgent efforts towards a political settlement in the context of an inclusive intra-Syrian dialogue, under the auspices of the United Nations and in accordance with resolution 2254 (2015).
