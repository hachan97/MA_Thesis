Mr. Seck (Senegal) (spoke in French): The
delegation of Senegal is pleased to see you, Sir,
personally presiding over this historic meeting.

While watching a Colombian film, I heard it
said that a people that does not know its history is
condemned to see that history repeat itself indefinitely.
The Government of Colombia and the Fuerzas
Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia have clearly
read their history books because now, through the Final
Agreement, which we have all awaited and hoped for,
Colombia is now writing a new page of its history.

Seen from an African perspective, the historic
action that Colombia has just taken is a ray of hope,
in particular as many conflicts continue to rage in
my continent. Senegal would therefore like to add its
voice in congratulating the guarantor countries of this
very promising process - the Republic of Cuba and
the Kingdom of Norway - and those that decided to
assist the process, namely, the Republic of Chile and
the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. We also wish
to congratulate our friend, the Ambassador of Great
Britain, on his outstanding work in facilitating the
adoption of resolution 2261 (2016), which Senegal,
along with all the other members of the Council,
sponsored and voted in favour of.
