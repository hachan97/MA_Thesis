Mr. Ciss (Senegal) (spoke in French): My delegation
voted in favour of resolution 2327 (2016), working in
close cooperation with the delegations of the African
member States, as we are convinced of the need for the
Security Council to be united in addressing the serious
crisis in the Republic of South Sudan. That approach
is supported by our determination to accompany South
Sudan in its quest for stability and lasting peace, while
supporting the United Nations Mission in South Sudan
and troop-contributing countries, to which we again
pay special tribute for their efforts and great sacrifices
in a very difficult environment.

The scope of challenges requires not only the
Security Council's ongoing investment, as reflected
by its many decisions in the past year, not to the
ongoing work of the Committee established pursuant to
resolution 2206 (2015), for South Sudan and the other
countries of the region, but also its united approach, in
full coordination with the organizations and countries
of the subregion, which have an important role to play.

Given the humanitarian emergency and the
imperative to protect civilians, we must provide the
Mission with the means for effective response. We
believe that ifit is to succeed, the Security Council needs
to engage in dynamic and constructive dialogue both
with the Transitional Government of National Unity and
with the subregional and regional organizations, such
as the Intergovernmental Authority on Development
and African Union. Such exchanges and cooperation,
which we will need to further bolster, must address the
main elements involved in stabilizing South Sudan,
including the implementation of the Agreement on the
Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South
Sudan, the protection of civilians, upholding human
rights and providing humanitarian assistance.
In conclusion, my delegation takes due note of
the decision of the South Sudanese Government to
authorize the deployment of the Regional Protection
Force and to organize a national inclusive dialogue. We
encourage the Government to continue along the path
of national reconciliation.
