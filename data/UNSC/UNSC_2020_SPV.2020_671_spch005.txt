Indonesia appreciates the efforts of the Russian Federation in trying to find a solution with regard to the renewal of the cross-border mechanism. Since the negotiations started on 18 June, my delegation has shared and highlighted various recommendations by the Secretary-General and relevant United Nations bodies, which emphasized it was imperative to renew the cross-border authorization for the use of the Bab Al-Salam and Bab Al-Hawa border crossings for 12 months. The two border crossings are indeed lifelines for millions of civilians, particularly those in camps for internally displaced persons. And the United Nations cannot reach them by other means. We welcome the improvement of cross-line deliveries of United Nations humanitarian assistance, in cooperation with the Syrian Government and other key humanitarian partners. At the same time, we also note the Secretary-General's observation in his report that "Tc]ross-line assistance is currently not a viable alternative, and a sustained, large-scale cross-border response will continue to be necessary to meet the enormous humanitarian needs in the north-west" (SS/2020/576, para. 50). In this regard, we believe that the draft resolution (S/2020/576) does not fully capture the urgent needs of millions of people in the north-west whose lives depend on the two cross-border operations. My delegation would like to thank the co-penholders for continuing the discussion and for engaging all Council members with the aim of reaching compromise and consensus. We have the responsibility to save people's lives, and that includes the lives of millions of Syrian people.
