Mr. Guehenno: I would say, as the Foreign
Minister of Sierra Leone just said, that the challenge
now is to move from a peacekeeping situation to a
peace-building situation, to transform what is indeed a
real success into a sustainable success. That is where,
now, the international community must stay the course.
Peacekeeping is funded through assessed contributions;
development will require voluntary contributions. I
think the future of the peace process in Sierra Leone
very much depends now on the sustained efforts of the
international community in partnership with the
Government and the people of Sierra Leone to
consolidate the results so far achieved.
