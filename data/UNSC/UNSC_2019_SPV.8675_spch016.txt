Mr. Pecsteen de Buytswerve (Belgium) (spoke in French): I was intending to speak during our informal
consultations, but I will also say a few words here.

I would first like to thank Special Adviser Karim
Khan for his report (S/2019/878), and for the work that
has been done and the progress made in recent months.
I would of course also like to pay tribute to Mr. Kachi's
very poignant testimony, and I would like to commend
his courage, which demands our respect and admiration.
I think it reminds us of the importance of responding
to survivors' expectations so that the crimes committed
are recognized, those responsible are brought to justice
and the country's reconciliation and reconstruction is
made possible.
I would also like to highlight the close cooperation
that has developed between the Iraqi authorities and
the United Nations Investigative Team to Promote
Accountability for Crimes Committed by Da'esh/
Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (UNITAD).
Mr. Khan described that cooperation as exemplary
and remarkable, which is very good to hear. I would
also like to pay particular tribute to the bill introduced
by the Iraqi Parliament to enable the prosecution of
war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.
We encourage UNITAD to collaborate with the Iraqi
authorities and other United Nations bodies in order to
ensure that the bill becomes law, taking into account the
policies and good practices of the United Nations and
international law. Belgium remains fully committed to
supporting UNITAD in its work.
