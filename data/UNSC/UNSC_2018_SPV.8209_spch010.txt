Mr. Shen B0 (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
Charter of the United Nations clearly outlines the
functions of and divisions of labour among all the main
organs of the United Nations. The primary role of the
Security Council is to maintain international peace and
security, not to consider human rights issues. Pushing
the Security Council into discussing human rights
issues erodes the functions of other United Nations
organs and will not help us to find an effective solution
to the issue. China opposes holding deliberations in the
Security Council on such issues, and in particular on
questions of human rights in Syria.
