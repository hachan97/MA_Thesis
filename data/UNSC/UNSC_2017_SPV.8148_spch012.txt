The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as the representative of Japan.

I would like to express my gratitude to the United
States for its leadership in creating thw important
and timely resolution 2396 (2017), addressing foreign
terrorist fighters (FTFs), in particular returning and
relocating FTFs. Japan is pleased to have co-sponsored
the resolution.

Resolution 2396 (2017) will promote the use of
Advanced Passenger Information, Passenger Name
Records and biometric data. It will also the promote
the connection of INTERPOL databases to airports
and border checkpoints. Sharing data not only among
countries but also among agencies within each country
will strengthen our collective ability to address FTFs.
I stress the importance of moving from adoption to
implementation. Japan is always ready to work closely
with other countries to enhance their capacities. We
must unite against FTFs, including returning and
relocating FTFs, by implementing this resolution.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

There are no more names inscribed on the list
of speakers.

The meeting rose at 3.50 pm.
