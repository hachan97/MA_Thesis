Mr. Mayoral (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish):
Argentina was a sponsor of resolution 1706 (2006) and
voted in favour of it because we believe that one of the
main obligations of the United Nations is to protect
civilian populations. In that context, we believe that
the Security Council cannot Shirk its responsibility to
protect, in particular, vulnerable groups - women and
children - since they are defenceless. We are certain
that the Government of the Sudan will now cooperate
in strengthening the African Union forces and
subsequently in expanding the deployment of the

United Nations Mission in the Sudan beginning on
1 January 2007. We look forward to understanding and
assistance from the Government of the Sudan so that
the deployment can take place in an orderly fashion;
there must be no infringement of the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of that country.

Finally, we insist once again that parties involved
in the Darfur conflict who have not yet signed the
Darfur Peace Agreement concluded in May do so
without delay in order to ensure stable and lasting
peace in the Sudan. Instability there affects not only
that country but the entire region.
