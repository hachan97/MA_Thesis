The President: I thank the representative of France
for his kind words addressed to me.

There are still a number of speakers. In view of the
lateness of the hour, and with the concurrence of the
members of the Council, I intend to suspend the meeting
now.

The meeting was suspended at 1.25 p.m. and resumed
at 4.50 pm.
