The President (spoke in Spanish): The statement
made at the beginning of the meeting today by the Deputy
Secretary-General certainly set the tone for our very
interesting and useful debate. As we near the end of the
meeting, I should like to ask the Deputy Secretary-General,
Ms. Louise Frechette, to make a few comments.
