Mr. Burleigh (United States of America): I too, like
my colleagues, would like to thank Under-Secretary-
General Miyet for his briefing and his update on the
report. I should like especially to recognize Ambassador
Dahlgren and his contribution, both in his role as
Chairman of the sanctions Committee for the past difficult
period and for this initiative he has taken, the results of
which we have learned about today - that is, the
indispensable personal observations and assessments he
has made about the situation in Sierra Leone. I agree with
Ambassador Amorim that the situation on the ground
there is very discouraging.

I want to thank Ambassador Dahlgren for his
mention of the role that our presidential Special Envoy,
Reverend Jesse Jackson, is trying to play in facilitating
the reconciliation between the countries in question. He
was here this week and was able to brief Council
colleagues about his activities, and we will continue to
keep Council members informed of his efforts.

I have two specific questions, because, as has been
noted, we will go into more detail later when we talk
about the renewal of the mandate. But I wanted to ask, on
this joint border-monitoring mechanism proposal between
Liberia and Sierra Leone, if either Ambassador Dahlgren
or Under-Secretary-General Miyet would like to address
what practical next steps there may be or what role we
might play in trying to help this process along - "we"
meaning the Council or the Secretariat.

 

Secondly, for Under-Secretary-General Miyet, I have
a question about the force protection of the United Nations
personnel deployed there, and whether he believes that
arrangements are still adequate for their protection or
whether some consideration is still being given to any
redeployment of the personnel of the United Nations
Observer Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL).
