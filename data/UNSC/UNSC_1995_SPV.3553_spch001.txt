The President (interpretation from Spanish): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the
representative of Croatia in which they request to be invited
to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's
agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose,
with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Misic' (Bosnia and Herzegovina) and Mr. Nobilo (Croatia) took
places at the Council table.

The President (interpretation from Spanish):: The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them document
S/ 1995/560, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States
of America.

I should like to draw to the attention of the members
of the Council the following revision in the text of the draft
resolution (8/1995/560) in its provisional form. In
paragraph 4, the word "unharmed" should be added after
the word "release".

The first speaker is the representative of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, on whom I now call.
