Mr. Tello (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish):
Mexico is grateful for the opportunity to participate in
this meeting of the Council, convened to terminate the
mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in
El Salvador (ONUSAL).

As members of the Council know, my country
devoted special attention and commitment to negotiations
in the peace process for El Salvador, in which we had the
honour to be a member of the Group of Friends
established by the Secretary-General.

It was of special satisfaction to Mexico that the
difficult negotiating process resulted in the signing of the
Peace Accord at Chapultepec Castle on 16 January 1992.

As the Secretary-General rightly observes in his
24 March 1995 report to the Security Council,

"There is much reason for satisfaction at what
has been accomplished by the Salvadorans during
this time. ONUSAL can take credit for having
helped the Salvadorans to take giant strides away
from a violent and closed society towards a
democratic order where institutions for the protection
of human rights and free discourse are being
consolidated." (S/1995/220, para. 68)

ONUSAL is unquestionably one of the greatest
recent achievements of the United Nations. However, as
members of the Group of Friends, we share the Secretary-
General's concern about those elements of the Accord
that have not yet been fully implemented, while
expressing our confidence that President Calderon Sol's
Government will take the steps necessary to ensure that
commitments will be fulfilled as soon as possible.

In that connection, we welcome the Secretary-
General's decision to maintain a presence in El Salvador
to verify and report upon compliance with aspects whose
implementation is still pending. This marks a renewed
commitment by the international community to
consolidate a just and lasting peace in that Central
American country.

We urge the members of the Security Council to
adopt the draft resolution before them unanimously.
