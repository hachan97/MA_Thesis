Mr. Trullols Yabra (Dominican Republic) (spoke in Spanish): We are pleased with the Council's
adoption today of resolution 2494 (2019), which renews
the mandate of the United Nations Mission for the
Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), and we
thank the United States for its work as its penholder.
The Dominican Republic voted in favour of resolution
2494 (2019), as it is a balanced text in which the Security
Council takes measures designed to advance the
political progress in Western Sahara and emphasizes
the importance of the work that MINURSO has done.
The resolution emphasizes the importance of achieving
a realistic, practical and lasting political solution based
on compromise.

The resolution expresses its full support for the
efforts of the Secretary-General and pays tribute to the
commendable work of President Kohler in achieving
new momentum with the first round-table meetings
bringing together representatives from Morocco, the
Frente Popular para la Liberacion de Saguia el-Hamra y
de Rio de Oro, Algeria and Mauritania, which we hope
the future Personal Envoy of the Secretary General will
continue. The resolution extends MINURSO'S mandate
for 12 months to provide the necessary time for the
future Personal Envoy to initiate consultations with the
relevant stakeholders and continue to give impetus to
the political process with the goal of reaching a just,
lasting and mutually acceptable political solution.

Lastly, the Dominican Republic believes that the
Moroccan initiative for Western Sahara's autonomy
represents a serious and credible step forward towards
a negotiated solution in Western Sahara.
