The President: I thank all participants for their
contributions today.

I should like also to thank Under-Secretary-
General Pascoe for his briefing.

Finally, I want on behalf of the Council to echo
Mr. Pascoe's words of gratitude to Alvaro de Soto for a
lifetime of service to the United Nations, including to
the cause which unites us all here today the cause of
peace in the Middle East.

 

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
