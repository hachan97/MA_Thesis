Mr. Fernandez Revollo (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): We would like to thank
the Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs,
Mr. Miroslav Jenea, for the information he shared
with us in connection with the latest developments
that prompted the convening of this afternoon's
emergency meeting.

Bolivia once again expresses its strongest and
most energetic condemnation of the conduct of nuclear
tests and the launching of ballistic missiles by the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, such as the
launch carried out yesterday, 4 July. Accordingly, we
call on that country to abandon its nuclear and ballistic-
missile programmes in a complete, verifiable and
irreversible way.

We urge all parties involved to refrain from
escalating rhetoric and actions that increase tensions
and jeopardize international peace and security,
especially in the Korean peninsula. In particular, we
urge all parties to refrain from any act of provocation,
any unilateral action and any action taken outside
international law and the principles of the Charter of
the United Nations.

We hail and reiterate our support for initiatives
of the dual-suspension type, which would allow for a
simultaneous cessation of both the launch of ballistic
missiles and nuclear tests, on the one hand, and the
conduct of military exercises on the Korean peninsula,
on the other.

Finally, we call on all parties involved to exclude
any military alternative or threatened use of force and
to resume dialogue to achieve a peaceful, diplomatic
and political solution, resulting in the denuclearization
of the Korea peninsula.
