The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Benon Sevan,
Executive Director of the Office of the Iraq
Programme.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Sevan to take a seat at the Council
table. The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

At this meeting the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Benon Sevan. At the end of the briefing
I will give the floor to Council members who wish to
make comments or ask questions. As there is no list of
speakers, I would invite Council members to indicate
to the Secretariat if they wish to make comments or ask
questions.

I now give the floor to Mr. Benon Sevan.
