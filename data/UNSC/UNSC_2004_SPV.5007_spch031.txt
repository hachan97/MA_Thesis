The President: I thank Mr. Simmons for his
contribution. We also look forward to seeing more
structured dialogue in the future with that important
organization, which is playing a greater role in the
global security architecture. I should also like to thank
Mr. Simmons for his contribution with regard to the
threat of weapons of mass destruction and small arms
and light weapons. Indeed, those are challenges we
must face together. In addition, I thank him for his
contribution concerning the Secretary-General.
