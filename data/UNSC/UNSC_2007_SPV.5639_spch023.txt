Mr. Abdal Mahdi (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): I
would like to sincerely thank all members of the
Security Council for the valuable comments that they
have made. The Government of Iraq will take all of
these observations into consideration and will uphold
its duties in accomplishing national reconciliation. It
will play its role as a Government in dealing with all
citizens in a manner that is based on citizenship, with
no sectarian or factional considerations.

1 would like to draw the attention of members of
the Council to an important fact. In Iraq today, there is
violence caused by the great developments that have
befallen our country and by its decades-long violent
history. This violence has political dimensions, and we
are extremely serious in our attempts to find political
solutions since they are more important than security
solutions.

However, there is another form of violence,
which is the responsibility of the international
community and Iraq's neighbouring countries. I speak
now of the violence that took the life of the late Special
Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sergio
Vieira di Mello, and the violence that has claimed the
lives of many diplomats, journalists and citizens from
the Russian Federation, France, the United Kingdom,
the United States, Algeria and Egypt.

This kind of violence, I believe, is not simply an
Iraqi responsibility. This terrorism is a regional and
international responsibility. I believe that it is
incumbent upon the United Nations to assist Iraq and
to lend a helping hand in confronting this kind of
violence which is the result of international networks
and which is widely funded by many international
institutions.
