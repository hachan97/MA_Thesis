Mr. Sidorov (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian): Russia, like other members of the Security
Council, has sternly condemned the actions of the
Bosnian Serb army in Srebrenica in violation of Security
Council decisions on safe areas in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.

We are concerned by reports of flagrant violations of
the norms of international humanitarian law in Srebrenica,

 

which we believe should be duly investigated, and by the
unavailability of information on the whereabouts of many
former inhabitants of Srebrenica. We support the demand
made in the draft resolution that the Bosnian Serbs give
access for representatives of the Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and other
international agencies to those who have been displaced
from Srebrenica and Zepa. It is also necessary that
prisoners of war be treated properly and in accordance with
international norms. We expect the report of the Secretary-
General, to be submitted no later than 1 September, to shed
light on the reported Violations of international humanitarian
law, and if such violations are confirmed the Security
Council will have to respond appropriately.
The lesson to be learned from events in Srebrenica
and Zepa is that we need to address directly the concept of
safe areas and the modalities for implementing that concept.
It is important to take steps to determine what kind of safe
area is acceptable to both sides. The relevant agreements
should include an agreement on the demilitarization of all
territories. If this had been done earlier, as Russia
repeatedly proposed, the tragic events in and around Zepa
and Srebrenica might have been avoided. Unfortunately,
there was no timely, positive response to our appeals. We
must correct that mistake, even at this late date.
