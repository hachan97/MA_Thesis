Ms. Lucas (Luxembourg) (spoke in French): I
join others in thanking Assistant Secretary-General
for Political Affairs Jeffrey Feltman for his briefing
on the developments concerning Ukraine. We share
his assessment that the situation in eastern Ukraine
is deteriorating alarmingly, especially in Kharkiv,
Luhansk and in the Donetsk area. We are deeply
concerned by the actions of the pro-Russian separatist
militias backed by Russia, aimed at destabilizing
eastern Ukraine and, it seems, preventing the holding
of the presidential elections on 25 May.

These destabilizing actions have intensified again
in recent days, with the proliferation of the illegal
occupation of public buildings, an increasing number
of attacks against the Ukrainian security forces and an
increase in violence against the local population. As
others have already mentioned, just yesterday peaceful
demonstrators in favour of the unity of the Ukraine were
violently attacked by armed pro-Russian gangs armed
with clubs and baseball bats in the city of Donetsk.
Today hundreds of pro-Russian demonstrators seized
the building of the regional administration and the
prosecutor's office in the city of Luhansk, and stormed
the police station.

We condemn those actions and the attacks
targeting political figures in the strongest terms. The
torture and murder of the Horlivka city councillor,
Volodymyr Rybak, whose remains were found last
week near Sloviansk together with those of a young
student from Kyiv, Yuriy Popravko, attest to the high
level of violence. Yesterday, the mayor of Kharkiv,
Henadiy Kernes, was the target of an assassination
attempt - there are differing interpretations with
regard to the party responsible. These crimes must be
investigated and everything possible must be done to
prevent similar cases in the future.

The violence of recent days shows once again the
need to urgently de-escalate the situation. We welcome
the positive steps taken by Ukraine to fulfil the
commitments set out in the Geneva statement adopted
on 17 April by Ukraine, Russia, the European Union
and the United States. The Ukrainian Government
has proposed an amnesty for those who leave the
buildings they occupy in eastern Ukraine, as long as
they have not committed crimes. It is ready to launch
an inclusive national dialogue on constitutional reform
and decentralization, and has acted with restraint in
response to the actions of armed militias in the east.

The international community expects Russia, for
its part, to take concrete steps to bring the separatists in
eastern Ukraine to de-escalate in accordance with the
commitments undertaken in the Geneva statement. We
expect Russia to use its influence over the separatist
movements to convince them to seek dialogue with
the Ukrainian Government instead of fighting. Russia
should publicly condemn the actions of the separatists
aimed at destabilizing Ukraine and call on armed
militants to leave the illegally occupied buildings.
Finally, the withdrawal of Russian forces from the
Ukrainian border is an essential step for de-escalating
tensions, especially in eastern Ukraine.

We strongly condemn the kidnapping near the
town of Sloviansk on 25 April of a team of military
inspectors deployed under the 2011 Vienna document
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe (OSCE). We also condemn the temporary
detention, on 27 April, of two members of the OSCE
special monitoring mission in Yenakiyeve. The safety
of international observers deployed anywhere in
Ukraine must be ensured by all parties. The OSCE
monitoring mission must be able to fulfil its role in the
implementation of the Geneva statement.

We call on Russia to continue to use all of its
influence on the pro-Russian separatists to encourage
them to release unconditionally and promptly the seven
inspectors from OSCE participating States that they
have been holding hostage in Sloviansk for the past four
days, as well as the Ukrainian personnel accompanying
them.

We also condemn the restrictions on media freedom
and on the freedom of expression. The detention and
intimidation of journalists have increased over the
past two weeks in the east of the country. The day
before yesterday, pro-Russian separatists took control
of the regional public television station in Donetsk.
The OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media,
Ms. Dunja Mijatovie, has repeatedly warned against
misinformation and propaganda. I would like to join
her appeal and highlight that any limitations on the
freedom of the press is unacceptable.

Nothing can take the place of direct, substantive
dialogue between Kyiv and Moscow to find a diplomatic
solution to the Ukraine crisis. The crisis continues to
worsen. It will have harmful consequences for the entire
region, Europe and beyond. The Geneva declaration of
17 April cannot remain a dead letter. The alternative to
dialogue and to de-escalation would have incalculable
consequences for international peace and security.
