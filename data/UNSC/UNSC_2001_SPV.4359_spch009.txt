Mr. Shen Guofang (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
wish at the outset to thank the Under-Secretary-General
for Peacekeeping Operations, Mr. Guehenno, for his
comprehensive briefing. We appreciate the recent
efforts of the United Nations Interim Administration
Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to bring about the
comprehensive implementation of Security Council
resolution 1244 (1999) and the progress it has made in
that regard.

I wish today to address two issues. The first
relates to the elections. China has consistently
emphasized the importance of participation by
minorities in order to ensure the fairness and equity of
the elections. But we are concerned that the number of
members of minorities who have registered still
remains low. UNMIK must take further measures to
crack down on criminal activities, to improve the
security environment in Kosovo, to promote national
reconciliation and to build mutual trust so as to create
conditions in which refugees can return and in which
more members of minorities can participate in the
elections. Here, UNMIK should continue to strengthen
coordination and cooperation with the authorities of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

The second point relates to illegal arms flows.
When it comes to security issues, the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia is closely linked to the entire
Balkan region. To maintain peace and stability in the
region, it is very important to prevent illegal arms
flows in border areas between Kosovo and Macedonia
and to cut off the sources of supply of illegal weapons.
In our view, UNMIK can and should take more
effective measures in that regard. Like other countries,
we hope that efforts to seize illegal arms that are in the
hands of members of the Albanian minority will be
successful in order to create conditions favourable for
the implementation of the Framework Agreement on
Macedonia and to maintain peace and stability in the
region.
