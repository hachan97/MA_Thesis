Mr. Elaraby (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic):
The Egyptian delegation should like to extend its most
profound condolences to the Government and people of
China, as well as to the Chinese Mission to the United
Nations, on the passing of Paramount Leader Deng
Xiaoping.

Deng Xiaoping was in the leadership of China for
half a century and personally led that country for the past
18 years. He also helped to develop policies and reforms
for the modernization of China that have allowed the
country to achieve important progress. He has left an
indelible mark on the economic, political and social life
of his country.

China and the entire world will always remember
with appreciation and gratitude the many years of wise
leadership of the great leader Mr. Deng Xiaoping.
