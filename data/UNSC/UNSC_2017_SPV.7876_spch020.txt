Mr. Bermudez (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish):
Uruguay is grateful for the detailed briefings by
Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman and Under-
Secretary-General Stephen O'Brien, as well as by
Ambassador Ertugrul Apakan.

Uruguay continues to follow with great concern
the recent developments in Avdiivka and the recent
violations of the ceasefire. Uruguay thinks it is crucial
to step up efforts and dialogue to ensure the effective
implementation of the Minsk agreements, as they
constitute the right way to achieve a political and
peaceful solution to this conflict. Along those lines,
Uruguay calls on the parties to ensure the effective
protection ofhuman rights ofthe residents of all regions,
in particular of the territories of Donetsk and Luhansk.

At the same time, it is also crucial for the parties
to the conflict to respect international humanitarian
law in all circumstances. This is critical to addressing
the situation of internally displaced persons and people
requiring humanitarian assistance, in particular in
terms of protection and given the current weather
conditions, the continuous supply of water, food, energy
and heat, emergency shelter and other critical services
in temperatures that drop to -20Â°C

Uruguay recognizes the important work being
carried out by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission to
Ukraine and believes that it is vital for the Mission to
be allowed access to all conflict areas in order to end
to fulfil its mandate. We urge a resumption of the spirit
with which the Security Council unanimously adopted
resolution 2202 (2015). The parties must comply with
their obligatioons in that regard.

In conclusion, Uruguay hopes that the challenges in
implementing the Minsk agreements can be overcome
and that the disputes can be settled exclusively through
peaceful means, dialogue between the parties and with
full respect for international law and democratic values.
