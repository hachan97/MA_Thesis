Mr. Shen Bo (China) (spoke in Chinese): I would
like to thank Ms. Bensouda for her briefing.

China has been watching closely the developments
in Libya. We support the political transition process
taking place in Libya under the good offices ofthe United
Nations. We are pleased to see that the Presidential
Council of the Libyan Government of National Accord
has arrived at the capital and begun its work. That is
important progress in the implementation of the Libyan
Political Agreement by all parties. We hope that all
parties in Libya will remain committed to a political
process that is Libyan-led and open to all parties,
effectively implement the Libyan Political Agreement
and insist on settling differences through negotiation,
with a View to the early restoration of national security
and stability. That is both a precondition and the basis
for achieving judicial justice in Libya.

China's position with regard to international
judicial institutions remains unchanged.
