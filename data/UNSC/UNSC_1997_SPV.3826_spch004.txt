Mr. Monteiro (Portugal): The work of the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) is fundamental to
achieving the goals that the Council established in adopting
resolution 687 (1991). Full cooperation on the part of the
Iraqi authorities is essential to this process.

The Security Council must be consistent in its
decisions. We cannot forget why resolution 1115 (1997)
was adopted last June. The Council must take a firm
stand in order to send a clear signal that it cannot tolerate
further incidents, such as those reported by the Executive
Chairman of the Special Commission, which prevent
UNSCOM. from carrying out its mission.

We acknowledge that Iraq has been offering some
degree of cooperation to UNSCOM. lately. But, at the
same time, obstruction of UNSCOM. inspections has
continued. This is unacceptable. Nothing less than full
cooperation by Iraq with the Special Commission will
enable it to fulfil its task.

We agree with those who say that what is most
important is to have access to the truth. The cooperation
of Iraq is fundamental in this regard. The Council shall
give UNSCOM. and Ambassador Butler all the latitude he
deems necessary, in accordance with the resolutions of
the Council concerning the work of the Special
Commission, to establish the most adequate means to
achieve its goals.

For these reasons, the draft resolution before us is,
in our View, the most appropriate response of the Council
in the present circumstances. It sends a clear message to
Iraq: Let UNSCOM. proceed with its task. Let it find the
truth. Let the Commission accomplish its mission.
Cooperate fully with it so that sanctions may finally be
lifted.

This is why we have co-sponsored this draft
resolution.
