The President: I propose that the Security Council
invite the Permanent Observer of the observer State
Palestine to the United Nations to participate in this
meeting, in accordance with the provisional rules of
procedure and the previous practice in that regard.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

In accordance with rule 39 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure, I invite Mr. Taye-Brook
Zerihoun, Assistant Secretary-General for Political
Affairs and Acting Under-Secretary-General for
Political Affairs, to participate in this meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda.

I refer to note S/2017/507 and encourage members
and non-members of the Council to limit their
statements to five minutes or less, and the briefer to the
agreed time limit.

I now give the floor to Mr. Zerihoun.
