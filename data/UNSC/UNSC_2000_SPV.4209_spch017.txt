The President: I shall now make a statement in
my capacity as the representative of Namibia.

My delegation is grateful to the High
Representative for his comprehensive and informative
report on the implementation of the peace process in
Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The report of the High Representative indicates
that, overall, the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina
has been calm and stable. Steady, albeit slow, progress
has been achieved in areas of institution-building. This
achievement gives us hope that Bosnia and
Herzegovina will soon chase the ghost of ethnic
cleansing to the dustbin of history. It also encourages
us to continue supporting the efforts and contributions
extended to the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina by
the international community.

Namibia takes note with appreciation the
appraisal of the peace process by the Peace
Implementation Council which met in Brussels in May.
The three strategic targets identified with respect to the
consolidation of State institutions enjoy my country's
attention.

We are happy to learn that the rate of return of
refugees and internally displaced persons has picked up
this year. However, the macro-economic performance
of the country has been mixed. In this regard, my
delegation is encouraged by the new political climate
in the region, especially the new Administration in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as well as in Croatia.

Finally, we acknowledge the work ofthe office of
the High Representative and the United Nations
Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as other
international institutions which have dedicated their
financial and human resources to build democratic
State institutions in that country.

I now resume my function as President of the
Security Council.

The next speaker on my list is the representative
of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
