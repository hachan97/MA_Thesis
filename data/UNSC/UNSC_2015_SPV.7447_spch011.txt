Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
illicit trade in small arms and light weapons exacerbates
regional armed conflicts, worsens regional tension,
fosters terrorism and transnational organized crime
and causes bodily harm and death to innocent civilians.
Tackling the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons
is of great significance for maintaining regional peace
and stability and promoting the normal socioeconomic
development of the countries concerned.

The Chinese Government has always been
firmly opposed to the illicit trade in small arms and
light weapons. The Security Council should play an
active role in further strengthening the efforts of the
international community in combating the illicit trade in
small arms and light weapons. In the current situation,
more than ever, the international community needs a
Security Council resolution that can comprehensively
and effectively combat the illicit trade in small arms
and light weapons.

The Chinese delegation took part in consultations
on resolution 2220 (2015) in a positive and constructive
spirit. During the consultations, some members, in
particular the three African members, proposed some
important, legitimate and highly valid amendments.
The consultations should have further heeded the
Views of all sides and sought to solve differences so as
to reach a text that could enjoy the unanimous support
of the whole Council. It is regrettable that the relevant
amendments have not been fully reflected in the text. In
the light of the situation, China abstained in the voting
on resolution 2220 (2015).
