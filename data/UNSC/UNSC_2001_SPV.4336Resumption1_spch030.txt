Mr. Singhara Na Ayudhaya (Thailand): I should
like to express my appreciation to you, Sir, for
convening this important open meeting on the agenda
item "The situation between Iraq and Kuwait". I should
also like to thank the Russian Federation for taking the
initiative of requesting such a meeting.

Like many other countries, Thailand is primarily
concerned over the well-being and welfare of the
people of Iraq. The sanctions imposed on Iraq by
relevant resolutions of the Security Council have
brought about hardship for ordinary Iraqi citizens. The
suffering, particularly that of women, children and the
elderly, has gone on for so long.

We note that the existing humanitarian
programme in Iraq, under the auspices of the oil-for-
food programme, has, over the past four years,
contributed to improving the living conditions of the
average Iraqi, according to the Secretary-General's
report pursuant to paragraph 5 of resolution 1330
(2000). According to the same report, however, more
can be done to alleviate the plight of the Iraqi people
and it is incumbent on all parties concerned

"to refrain from any actions that could exacerbate
the already fragile living conditions of the
average Iraqi". (S/2001/505, para. 136)

In order to facilitate the eventual lifting of the
United Nations sanctions, Thailand hopes that Iraq will
abide by the appropriate United Nations resolutions
and thus help all parties concerned to join hands in
finding a long-term and comprehensive solution.
