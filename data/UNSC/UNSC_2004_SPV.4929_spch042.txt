Mr. Atiyanto (Indonesia): The delegation of
Indonesia was appalled to learn of the assassination by
Israel on 22 March 2004 of the leader of Hamas,
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. That attack led, even more
sadly, to the deaths of eight others, and we strongly
condemn it.

In our view, Israel's policy of targeted
assassinations is not only illegal under international
law, but it cannot guarantee peace. If Israel's objective
is peace, if peace is the jewel that Israel seeks through
the often brutal deployment of the Israel Defense
Forces in the occupied Palestinian territory, if peace is
the reward for which Israel hunts in its construction of
the separation wall, then the methods of the
Government of Israel are unlikely to yield any of those
dreams.

My delegation is convinced that the militaristic
approach of the Government of Israel does not favour
the Government of Israel. The strategy has yielded only
the further return of violence. Consequently, it is easy
to see that this strategy is not in the interest of the
ordinary people of Israel, who are in the front line of
revenge attacks.

My delegation calls on Israel to recognize that its
future is best served by returning to the negotiating
table with the Palestinians. We call on Israel to
recognize that peace has a far better chance through
dialogue than through military force. We call on Israel
to recognize that peace has a far better chance through
the support of the international community - available
through the implementation of the road map - than in
the language of bullets and bulldozers. Israel must
immediately terminate the practice of the extrajudicial
killings of Palestinians and return in good faith to
negotiations. Only such an approach can lead to peace
and a just and comprehensive settlement, as anticipated
in the road map.
