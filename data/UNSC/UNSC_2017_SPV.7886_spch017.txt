The Secretary-General: I was flying yesterday
evening from Lisbon to New York when, during the
flight, one of the flight attendants came to me with a
small note saying that it was coming from the Captain.
The note said that Vitaly Churkin had passed away. I
must confess that my first reaction was not to believe
it. I had not had the opportunity to work with him for a
long time, as has happened with many other members
of the Security Council, but I always felt that he was
one of those persons who represent life itself.

Unfortunately, it was not ajoke in bad taste, nor was
it misinformation; it was the truth. I believe that Vitaly
Churkin was not only an outstanding diplomat, but an
extraordinary human being who possessed a unique
combination of intelligence, knowledge, and firmness
in the expression of his beliefs. He was also a man
with a remarkable sense of humour and an enormous
warmth that would make us all feel a natural tendency
to become friends.

I want to express my deepest condolences to
Mrs. Irina Churkina, to Vitaly's family, to the
Government and the people of the Russian Federation,
and most especially to Vitaly Churkin's colleagues
in the Russian Mission and in the Ministry for
Foreign Affairs.

I think Vitaly's passing represents a deep loss for all
of us at the United Nations, including for the members
of the Security Council, where his distinctive voice was
ever present over the past decade and where that voice
will indeed be missed in the sessions to come.
