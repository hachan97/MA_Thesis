The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform members of the Council that I intend to adjourn
this meeting at 1.15 p.m.

As many questions have already been put to the
High Representative and Mr. Klein, I would appeal to
the remaining speakers to be as brief as possible and to
proceed directly to asking their questions.
