Mr. Vieira (Brazil): I have the honour to speak on
behalf of Brazil, Chile and Guatamala.

Two days ago (see S/PV.7920), we expressed before
the Council our support for the Secretary-General's
recommendations on gradually withdrawing the
military component of the United Nations Stabilization
Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) until the closure of the
Mission on 15 October. We have also supported the
proposal to establish a follow-on mission focused on
strengthening the rule of law, police development and
monitoring human rights in Haiti.

Regrettably, we were surprised, however, to see
in resolution 2350 (2017) the last-minute introduction
of paragraph 18, which had never been discussed in
the Group of Friends of Haiti. Although we favour
accountability in peacekeeping operations, we believe
that the content of this paragraph is unnecessary in the
current resolution and does not reflect the reality on the
ground and the high-level performance of MINUSTAH's
troops. During the 13 years of MINUSTAH, there has
been no problem at all regarding undeclared caveats,
lack of effective command and control, refusal to obey
orders, failure to respond to attacks on civilians or
inadequate equipment, as paragraph 18 may suggest.

In a moment of review and possibly reform of
peacekeeping operations, it is crucial to highlight
the importance of tailored approaches. The idea
of standardizing and replicating paragraphs in all
resolutions of the Council regarding peacekeeping
operations is ill conceived. One size does not fit all.
Our countries are very proud of the work done by
MINUSTAH, including its military component,
which has had exemplary behaviour and operational
performance, contributing to its success and ultimately

to the work of the Security Council.

The meeting rose at 10.50 a.m.
