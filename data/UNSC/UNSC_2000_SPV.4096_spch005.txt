The President: We thank President Chiluba from
the bottom of our hearts for staying and for giving us this
important mission. I am sure my colleagues will join me
in saying that we will pay close attention to this question
and will welcome him back to the Security Council
whenever he wishes to ask us to help once again
accelerate and reinforce the Lusaka peace process. We
listened with great attention to his wisdom and to his very
kind words about us.
