The President (interpretation from Russian): There
are no other names on the list ol' speakers.

The Security Council has heard the views of its
members and of other States Members of the United
Nations on the item on its agenda. These views, as well
as those expressed by Member States during the
discussions on relevant agenda items at the fiftieth session
of the General Assembly, will be taken into account by
the Council when it gives further consideration to the
question of consultations with troop contributors.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 6 p.m.
