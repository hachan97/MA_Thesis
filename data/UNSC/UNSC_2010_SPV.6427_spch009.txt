The President: I thank Mr. Daccord for his
briefing.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers
to limit their statements to no more than four minutes,
in order to enable the Council to carry its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate the text in writing and to
deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.

I shall now give the floor to members of the
Council.
