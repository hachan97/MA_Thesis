Mr. McLay (New Zealand): I would like to thank
you, Mr. President, for convening this debate and for
allowing New Zealand to make this statement. I will
be brief, but discussion of an international incident
that brings death to New Zealanders demands some
comment.

New Zealand joins with others in expressing
its deepest sympathy to the families, friends and
colleagues of all those who have died. We also express
our solidarity with our close friend Malaysia - indeed,
with all the countries whose people have died. Our
thoughts and prayers are with them all at this incredibly
sad time.

We express outrage at the mounting evidence that
this totally unnecessary and avoidable tragedy resulted
from a surface-to-air missile strike. If that evidence
is confirmed, this is a grave crime that demands an
international, thorough, credible and independent
investigation. We call in particular for protecting the
integrity of the crash site.

New Zealand welcomes the calls for such an
investigation - from the Secretary-General, the
Security Council and many others. The circumstances
of this tragedy, the catastrophic nature of its occurrence
and its occurrence in a conflic zone mean that the
international community, in particular those like New
Zealand and others that have lost nationals, has a right to
demand such an investigation. Any party with relevant
informaton that can help in that process must offer its
proactive assistance and cooperation. Perpetrators must
be brought to justice: no qualifications, no ifs, no buts,
no maybes.

The situation in Ukraine has now gone beyond
dangerous. It now kills people from other parts of the
world with no direct involvement in the local conflict.
This morning families in New Zealand and many
other countries are waking up to the tragic reality that
they have lost loved ones to a conflict that threatens
international peace and security and demands the
ongoing attention of the Council.
