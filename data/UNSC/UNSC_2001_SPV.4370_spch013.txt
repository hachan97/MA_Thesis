Mr. Ahsan (Bangladesh): The Government and
the people of Bangladesh are shocked at the despicable,
cowardly acts of terrorism committed yesterday in New
York, Washington, DC, and Pennsylvania. We are
overwhelmed by the enormous toll in innocent human
lives, destruction and damage in cities that these
horrific attacks have taken. The Government of
Bangladesh has condemned these attacks in the
strongest terms in a statement released yesterday. On
behalf on my Government, I express our deep
condolences to the bereaved families and our sympathy
for those affected by this catastrophe.

These attacks represent an affront to humanity
and a challenge to the international community. We
must collectively face this challenge. Bangladesh
reiterates its full support to international efforts in
combating all acts of terrorism. My delegation fully
endorses the resolution before us.
