Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding

Following consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council welcomes the signing of
the Interim Accord between Greece and the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (S/1995/794, annex I) and looks forward to the establishment of
a new relationship between the parties based on
international law and peaceful, friendly relations.
The Council believes the accord will promote the
strengthening of stability in the region.

"The Security Council commends both parties,
the Secretary-General, the Secretary-General's
Special Envoy, Cyrus Vance, and the United States
envoy, Matthew Nimetz, for their efforts in bringing
about this important achievement, pursuant to
Security Council resolutions 817 (1993) and 845
(1993). The Council encourages them to continue
their efforts to resolve the remaining differences
between the parties and urges the parties to
implement fully the Interim Accord."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
