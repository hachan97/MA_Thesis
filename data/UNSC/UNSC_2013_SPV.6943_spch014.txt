The President (spoke in Russian): This meeting
is probably the last of the month. On behalf of our
delegation, I would like to express our sincere gratitude
to the members ofthe Council, especially my colleagues
the Permanent Representatives and their staffs, as well
as to the Secretariat, for the support they have given us
during Russia's presidency. It has indeed been a busy
month, and one in which we succeeded in reaching
consensus on several important issues within our
purview. We could not have achieved those results alone
or without the hard work of support and constructive
cooperation by every delegation and the representatives
of the Secretariat, as well as the interpreters, translators,
meeting services staff and sound engineers.

As we end our presidency, I know I speak on behalf
of the Council in wishing the Rwandan delegation
success in the month of April. I am sure that the same
goes for every member of the Council.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Council will remain seized of the matter.

The meeting rose at 4.05 pm.
