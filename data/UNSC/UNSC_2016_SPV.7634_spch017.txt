Mr. Rosselli (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): On
behalf of the delegation of Uruguay, I would like to
thank Mr. De Mistura, Special Envoy of the Secretary-
General, not just for his briefing just now but also
for his untiring spirit, unceasing efforts and his
determination to advance the mission entrusted to him
by the Secretary-General and the Security Council. Our
thanks include his team as well, and we would like to
reiterate our confidence in their work. The Uruguayan
delegation would also like to thank the United States
and the Russian Federation not only for drafting
resolution 2268 (2016), which we have just adopted, but
also for their efforts in helping to reach this new stage
in a conflict that has already gone on far too long.

On Wednesday, the Government of Uruguay issued
a communique in which, essentially, we expressed
our satisfaction with the recent announcement by
the United States Secretary of State, John Kerry, and
Sergey Lavrov, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the
Russian Federation, as co-Chairs of the International
Syria Support Group, regarding their signing of an
agreement on the entry into force of a cessation of
hostilities in Syria. Uruguay believes it is an important
step forward in the efforts to put an end to the violence
and facilitate humanitarian access in Syria, particularly
to besieged areas. In that regard, we would like to call
on the parties to respect the commitments they have
undertaken and to work to effectively comply with and
implement them.

This is a sign of hope for the Syrian people and
an essential step towards achieving the effective
implementation of resolution 2254 (2015). My delegation
voted in favour of the adoption of both resolution 2254
(2015) and resolution 2268 (2016), in the belief that this
is a first step towards achieving a lasting ceasefire,
which should make it possible to advance a political
process that will enable us to end this long conflict.
