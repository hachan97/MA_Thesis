Mr. Martins (Angola): Angola voted in favour of
resolution 2333 (2016), renewing the mandate of the
United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) for more
than 12 months, based mainly on our overall evaluation
of the very positive role of UNMIL, especially in
coming electoral period, and on the concrete request
of the Government of Liberia, in solidarity with and
understanding of the challenges can be faced during the
electoral period and the need for stability. That is why
we voted in favour of the resolution.

Angola regrets that the resolution was not adopted
unanimously by all Council members, as that would
have shown a more resolute and united position of the
Council, especially for a mission that can be considered
a success story of the Council. I hope that we will
continue to engage with UNMIL and the Government,
especially in this period of peace consolidation, which
is a very critical phase. We do not want to see a return
to a situation that has been positively corrected by the
Mission while in Liberia.
