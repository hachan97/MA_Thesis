Mr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): Mr.
President, may I at the outset say how pleased I am at
seeing you presiding over the Security Council and
how satisfied I am, as I am sure are all Member States,
for the entirely praiseworthy way that you have been
doing so this far. My delegation is also very pleased to
see Mexico return to the Council to make a
contribution that undoubtedly will be very valuable for
the successful outcome of its work.

May I also say how grateful we are to the
Ambassador of Mauritius, who has deserved the thanks
of our Organization for the talented and remarkably
effective way in which he conducted the work of the
Council last month.

What other international crisis could legitimately
lay claim to the attention of the Security Council as
much as the one that we are seeing today, with horror
and impotence increasing daily, in occupied Palestine.
We are grateful to all Council members for having
realized the seriousness and urgency of this by
acceding to the request of the legitimate
representatives of the Palestinian people, supported by
the Group of Arab States for an immediate meeting of
the Security Council.

The unprecedented degree of savagery that the
Israeli army has attained these past few weeks and the
enormous military means used to break down the
resistance of the Palestinian people no longer leave
room for any doubt about the term that should be used
to describe the situation. Despite the stubborn denials
of the Israelis, this is undoubtedly a situation of war.
As such, it calls for the urgent implementation of the
pertinent instruments of international humanitarian
law, specifically the Fourth Geneva Convention of
1949, to assure the protection of the people of
Palestine, who have been targeted by a regular army,
without prejudice to any additional measures of
protection that the United Nations is bound under the
Charter to take as a matter of urgency.

It is quite clear that the military actions that have
been directed against Palestinian Authority buildings
and the destruction of its infrastructures, the repeated
invasions of the territories under Palestinian
jurisdiction, the physical isolation of the legitimate
leadership, democratically elected by the Palestinian
people and represented by President Yasser Arafat, the
military and diplomatic harassment that has been
visited upon the Palestinian Authority are part and
parcel of a deliberate policy to reduce to naught what
remains of what was achieved in Oslo and to
completely disrupt the peace dynamic started in
Madrid.

Furthermore, the obstruction of any attempt to
reactivate the peace process under the specious pretext
of responding to acts of resistance caused by the
heightened feelings of a people that has been occupied
for generations, by political assassination and by State
terrorism has now been raised to the status of national
policy, openly approved in the Council of Ministers by
the Government of Israel, and which has been
stubbornly pursued, despite the unanimous
condemnation of the international community, in a very
clear and conscious effort to create the conditions most

favourable for the political process and most conducive
to heightening the intensity of the violence.

The objective is in fact to attack the credibility of
the Palestinian Authority, to break its internal workings
and to make it impossible for it to discharge its
obligations to maintain public order, while demanding
that it control the legitimate revolt of the people
against the occupier, which the constantly growing
violence of the repression feeds daily, leading to an
infernal spiral that, if we are not careful, may well
accelerate and reach the point of no return.

In other words, this Israeli policy, which has been
carefully thought out, is aimed at discrediting and
disqualifying the concept of a viable and responsible
Palestinian State, which is the final purpose of the
peace process, particularly since this eternal demand of
the Palestinian people registered a decisive
breakthrough on 10 November 2001, when it was
referred to by the President of the United States of
America before the General Assembly of the United
Nations.

In parallel, and to set aside definitively any
further chance of relaunching the peace process, the
Israeli Government pursues, tirelessly and with
impunity, its policy of territorial expansion in violation
of the resolutions of the United Nations, and has turned
a deaf ear to the appeals of the international
community to freeze its colonization policies. The
result of the worst-case policy pursued by Israel is that
the Middle East today is at the edge of the abyss, the
closest it has ever been to a generalized confrontation.

In the light of this situation, it is imperative that
the international community cease being merely a
passive bystander watching the Middle East sink into
Violence, and assume with courage and determination
its responsibilities before this nervous region, as the
Security-General warned us, begins to tip into total
war, with dramatic consequences for all.

From this point of view, Algeria considers
opportune and welcome the declared intention of the
Secretary-General to intensify the consultations,
through his Special Coordinator, with the members of
the "Quartet" as well as with the other regional and
international actors concerned in this matter.

Nevertheless, my country believes that the
Security Council, in view of its particular
responsibilities to maintain international peace and

security and its irreplaceable role, is called upon with
increased urgency to involve itself directly by
condemning this worst-case policy of the Israeli
Government, calling for the immediate cessation of
violence and sending, on the spot, a mission composed
of its members in order to examine, in the occupied
territories, the ways and means of providing the
protection that the Palestinian people is entitled to
expect from the international community, particularly
through the deployment of international observers, and
in order to set all the elements in place to undertake
effective and priority action to reduce the level of
violence and relaunch the peace process.

Therefore, in order to restore a minimum of
confidence, mend the broken threads of dialogue and
relaunch the peace process with increased
determination, in a new spirit and, we hope this time,
with greater chances of success, it seems to us
necessary to act from a common ground, acceptable to
all and accepted by all, such as that provided by the
recommendations contained in the Mitchell report and
the Tenet plan.

On the basis of a balanced approach, the Mitchell
report envisages a number of measures that would help
to set back on track the long-stymied peace process
through stopping the acts of violence, freezing the
colonization, re-establishing confidence and resuming
the negotiations. Therefore, the Security Council must
call for the total and immediate implementation of
these recommendations. Furthermore, it is essential
that an impartial monitoring mechanism be set up
promptly in the field to carry forward the Mitchell
report.

We are more than ever convinced that peace is a
strategic choice and that there is no alternative to a
return to the negotiating table. Therefore, Algeria is
firmly attached to the idea of a peaceful, just, lasting
and global settlement of the conflict in the Middle
East, based on international legality, in accordance
with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338
(1973), as well as on Israel's respect for the
commitments undertaken as part of the peace process,
particularly the principle of land for peace agreed in
Madrid, and on the total withdrawal of Israeli forces
from the Palestinian territories it has occupied since
1967. Such a settlement would make it possible to
realize the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian
people, including its right to establish its own
independent State with Al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital.
