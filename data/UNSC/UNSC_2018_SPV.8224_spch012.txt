Mr. Inchauste Jordan (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): As we stated at the
previous meeting on this topic (see S/PV.8203), Bolivia
categorically rejects the use of chemical agents as
weapons as an unjustifiable and criminal act because
it is considered a serious crime against international
law, peace and security. We express our concern about
the challenges facing the non-proliferation regime.
We reiterate the need for an independent, transparent,
objective, impartial and depoliticized investigation, in
accordance with the existing rules of international law,
in particular within the framework of the Chemical
Weapons Convention, to clarify the events of 4 March.

We believe that cooperation between the relevant
parties is essential for progress to be made, through the
relevant diplomatic channels, in resolving this issue and,
above all, in strengthening the non-proliferation regime.
