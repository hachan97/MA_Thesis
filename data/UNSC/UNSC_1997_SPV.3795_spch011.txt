The President (interpretation from Russian): I thank
the representative of Lesotho for his kind words addressed
to me and to my predecessor as President of the Security
Council.

I should like to inform the Council that I have
received letters from the representatives of Zimbabwe and
Mauritius, in which they request to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's
agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose,
with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional
rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Mapuranga
(Zimbabwe) and Mr. Wan Chat Kwong (Mauritius)
took the seats reserved for them at the side of the
Council Chamber.

The President (interpretation from Russian): The
next speaker on my list is the representative of Argentina.
I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to
make his statement.
