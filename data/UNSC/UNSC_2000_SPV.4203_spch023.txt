The President (spoke in French): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of Mali.

I would like at the outset to associate the Mali
delegation with the thanks addressed to Mr. Sergio
Vieira de Mello and all his team for the excellent work

they have done - under extremely difficult
conditions- since the establishment of the United
Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor
(UNTAET).

I would next like to make a few short comments
on the principal questions raised in the typically
detailed and lucid briefing made by Mr. Vieira de
Mello - a briefing for which I thank him.

First, I would like to emphasize that, like others,
we continue to be greatly concerned by the security
situation in which, as Mr. Vieira de Mello put it, there
has been a tragic deterioration. Mali strongly condemns
all the acts of violence, in particular those that occurred
in Atambua. We urge the Indonesian Government to
take all the necessary measures to ensure security and
prevent such acts from recurring.

As regards the situation of the refugees, I would
like to emphasize the necessity of quickly coming to a
resolution. From this point of view we believe it
essential that the Indonesian Government cooperate
with UNTAET and the Office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees both in the camps
and on the routes of return.

As concerns the transition process, we must call
attention to the need to involve the Timorese as soon as
possible. We are pleased by the steps taken in this
regard and encourage the international community to
provide the necessary support for the successful
organization of the national elections planned for the
second half of 2001 and for the continuation of the
efforts that have allowed UNTAET to achieve
significant progress in building a democratic and stable
State in East Timor.

I resume my function as President of the Council.
