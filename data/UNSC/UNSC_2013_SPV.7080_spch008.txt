Mr. Zhao Yong (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
have listened carefully to the briefing by Prosecutor
Bensouda and the statement made by the Permanent
Representative of the Sudan. The question of Darfur is
very complicated and involves many elements, including
the political process, security and stability, development
and reconstruction, humanitarian assistance and justice
and judicial order. Among those elements, the political
element is key. Only by promoting sustained progress
in the political process can lasting peace be achieved
in Darfur and solid foundations be laid for progress in
other areas, such as justice and the rule of law.

China believes that all of the efforts of the
international community regarding Darfur should
first facilitate pushing the political process in Darfur
forward and then achieving other goals.

The Sudanese Government plays a key role in
the promotion of the political process. Recently,
the Sudanese Government has been committed to
promoting the peace process in Darfur, implementing
the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur in good faith,
and diffusing intercommunal ethnic conflicts. In the
mean time, it has invited rebels to join the national
dialogue with a View to seeking a comprehensive
political settlement for the question of Darfur. The
rebels, on the other hand, have also reiterated that
they are ready to seek the reunification and territorial
integrity of the Sudan. China welcomes that.

We call on the international community to
provide active support and assistance to the Sudanese
Government, and we hope that the International
Criminal Court (ICC) will play a constructive role in
that regard.

As for the ICC's work relating to the question of
Darfur, China's position remains unchanged. We hope
that, in that regard, the Council will take into due
account the positions of the African Union, the League
of Arab States and other organizations and countries in
the region.
