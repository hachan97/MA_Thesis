Mr. Pankin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Mr. President, you were about to put to the
vote a text before us in document S/201 l/4l7. As far as
I understand from the consultations, the adoption of the
draft resolution, with the inclusion of the date of
10 July, with the resulting retroactive effect on the
Mission, is not in line with the Council's normal
practice. You will recall, Sir, that our staff worked on
the text. Could you explain the issue of the date? We
are adopting on ll July a document with retroactive
effect to yesterday. It was drafted to take effect 10 July,
so we have a situation in which we are adopting a
document with retrospective effect. That is not in line
with normal practice in the Council.
