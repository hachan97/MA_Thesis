Mr. Suescum (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): I
would like to express my gratitude for the detailed
briefings and information given by the President of the
Special Court and the Prosecutor, and also the
information given by the Deputy Secretary-General.

Panama would like to take advantage of this
opportunity to acknowledge the essential work done by
the Special Court and its vital contribution to the
establishment of the rule of law in Sierra Leone and in
the subregion.
We cannot overlook the contribution that the
Court has made to jurisprudence on questions such as
the legal effects of the amnesty called for in the Lome

Peace Agreement, or the irrelevance of the status of
head of State or the jurisdiction of special courts in
accordance with international law.

Moreover, as mentioned by the Prosecutor, the
Court has been the first to deal with various types of
crimes under international law, as well as crimes
against humanity and war crimes. The overall success
and effectiveness of the Special Court in its mission to
tackle impunity through the trials of those who are
primarily responsible is an important example to be
followed in Africa as well as in other regions.

In the period remaining before the Special Court
until December 2009, it will be important for it to be
able to guarantee that its work is in accordance with
the highest standards of international law. Therefore, it
is crucial for the international community to provide
the necessary resources to the Court.

Furthermore, a trial is very similar to an election,
where after the outcome there is still much work left to
be done. The Prosecutor mentioned steps that have
been undertaken to protect and relocate witnesses. It
would be interesting to know a little more about the
projections being considered for after 2009 in cases
such as the post-appeal process, adequate treatment of
prisoners and victims, the conservation of documents,
guaranteeing that these documents would be
accessible, and so forth.
