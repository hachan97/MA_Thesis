Mr. Sidorov (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian): The Russian delegation notes that, as stated in the
report of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the
United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) has achieved
significant progress in implementing the task entrusted to it,
in particular as concerns providing a safe and secure
environment in Haiti.

The first experience of democratic elections in Haiti,
of course, was an important step towards the restoration of
democracy in that State. At the same time, we note that 22
of the 27 political parties that took part in the elections
said, in one way or another, that they had serious problems
with the electoral process itself and with the way the votes
were counted. In addition, 15 leading opposition parties
decided not to participate at all in the elections. These facts
should prompt the international community to continue very
carefully to follow the development of the situation with a
view to holding the next round of voting, and then the
presidential elections.

We share the view of the Secretary-General of the
United Nations that in the long term, one of the key factors
for the stabilization of the political situation and the
security of Haiti will be the consolidation and the gradual
improvement of the social and economic situation in the
country. The international community must offer
assistance to this end.

We wish to stress that the main responsibility for the
fate of the country lies with the Government and the
people of Haiti. We hope that President Aristide, the
Government of Haiti and the leaders of the political
parties will learn from the mistakes made in the conduct
of previous elections and will take all necessary steps to
redress these mistakes in the subsequent electoral process.
This process must ensure that by February 1996, when
the United Nations operation in that country will come to
an end, the establishment of democratically elected
institutions and a proper security system.
