Mr. Alhariri (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): I wish to make one brief comment on the
representative of Israel's statement that we were not
"supposed" to speak. We made our statement under
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure,
which is perfectly clear, and with the approval of the
Council. I think addressing the Council in the way he
did is evidence of absolute arrogance. If there are
experts on international terrorism, everybody knows
that Israel is "the" expert on international terrorism. It
established a State on the basis of international
terrorism. If there is suffering in the world, it is
because of Israel.

In his statement, the representative of Israel
spoke three times of a third world war. The
Constitution of UNESCO tells us that "wars begin in
the minds of men", and it appears that this is what is in
the mind of Israel. If we think about this, we will find
the reasons for both the First and the Second World
Wars.
