The President: I wish to thank Secretary-General
Kofi Annan for his introductory statement to this most
important debate on the prevention of armed conflicts.
His presence here today attests to the importance of
this issue to the international community as it seeks to
develop a culture of prevention. I again thank him for
his presentation and for his recommendations for action
by the Council.

I would like to acknowledge the presence at the
Council table of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of
Namibia and President of the General Assembly, His
Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab. On behalf of the
Council I extend a warm welcome to him.
