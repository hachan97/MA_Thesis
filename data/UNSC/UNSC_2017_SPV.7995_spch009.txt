The President (spoke in Spanish): There are no
more names inscribed on the list of speakers.

Before adjourning the meeting, as this is the
last scheduled meeting of the Council during the
Bolivian presidency, I would like to express the sincere
appreciation of my delegation to all the members of
the Council, especially my colleagues, the permanent
representatives, the deputy permanent representatives,
the diplomatic experts of all the missions and the
secretariat of the Council for all the support it has given
to us, as well as the rest of the Council members, who
have supported us during the various meetings. Indeed,
as the representative of Uruguay said earlier, it has been
a busy month, but we think we achieved our objectives
in terms of reaching consensus on several important
issues within our purview. We could not have done it
alone or without the support and fraternal solidarity of
Council members, despite our differences.

I am grateful for the positive contributions of
every delegation on the various issues. I thank the
representatives of the Secretariat - the interpreters,
the translators, the Conference Services officers, the
sound engineers and the security personnel - who
safeguarded the Council's work.

As we end our presidency, I know that I speak
on behalf of the Council in wishing the delegation of
China the best of luck in the month of July, when it will
assume the presidency of the Council.

I now invite Council members to informal
consultations to continue our discussion on the subject.

The meeting rose at11.35 a.m.
