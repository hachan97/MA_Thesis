Mr. Vohidov (Uzbekistan) (spoke in Russian):
The position of principle of the Republic of Uzbekistan
on the issue under discussion was accurately and
clearly set out in a statement issued by the Ministry for
Foreign Affairs of Uzbekistan on 6 February 2003. Its
main points are as follows.

"The problem of Iraq, the implementation of
Security Council resolution 1441 (2002), the
activities of the United Nations inspectors in Iraq
and the positions of leading States with regard to
resolving this question cannot fail to be of
concern today to international public opinion and
to the international community, including
Uzbekistan.

"The statement made by United States
Secretary of State Colin Powell at the meeting of
the Security Council held on 5 February 2003 and
the arguments and reasons he cited are, in our
view, a sufficient and convincing reaffirmation of
the correctness of the United States position
aimed at the use of firmer and more substantial
measures to exclude any presence in Iraq of
weapons of mass destruction and any stocks and
technologies for their production in order to save
mankind from this horrendous danger."

In the context of today's discussion, the Republic
of Uzbekistan also believes it to be fundamentally
important to note the following two issues. First, a
solution to this question lies not in increasing the
number of inspectors, but in a change in Iraq's attitude
towards the issue of disarmament. Secondly, the
Security Council must shoulder its responsibilities and
take effective action to compel Iraq to implement
resolution 1441 (2002).
