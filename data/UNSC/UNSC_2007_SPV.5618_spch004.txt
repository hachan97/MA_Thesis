Mr. De Riviere (France) (spoke in French): I,
too, wish to commend the delegation of Slovakia and
Ambassador Burian for the excellent work
3
accomplished since the vote on resolution 1718 (2006)
and to thank him for his briefing.

France hopes that the Security Council
Committee established pursuant to resolution 1718
(2006) can swiftly complete the current work on the
adoption of its guidelines, and particularly that it can
take up substantive work on a number of important
issues. I will cite just three of them.

First, it would be desirable to be begin work on
identifying individuals and entities covered by the
measures freezing assets and restricting travel. Those
provisions of the resolution still have no practical
application, two months after its adoption.

Secondly, we must continue to consider more
specifically the possible addition of articles to the lists.
We have not been able to discuss in detail the proposals
that have been made. We must now do that.

Thirdly and finally, while this point is more
limited, France believes that the Committee should
have already specified that the resolution's provisions
do not ban the provision to North Korea of vaccines or
basic products - such as toothpaste, for example -
containing trace amounts of substances subject to the
embargo, such as fluoride. Common sense dictates that
it is regrettable not to spell things out, even as States
are adopting their measures to implement the
resolution at the national level.
