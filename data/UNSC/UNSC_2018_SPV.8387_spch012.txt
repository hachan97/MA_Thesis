Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara (MINURSO) has earnestly fulfilled the mandate
of the Security Council and made positive efforts to
maintain regional stability. China supports the renewal
of MINURSO's mandate so that it can continue to play
a constructive role in properly resolving the issue of
Western Sahara. We hope that, with respect to future
draft resolutions, there will be full consultations that
allow us to reach consensus. China appreciates the
good offices of the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-
General for Western Sahara, Mr. Horst Kohler, and
commends his initiative to convene a round table
in Geneva. We hope that, with the joint efforts of all
stakeholders, that round table will successfully take
place and lay the concrete foundations for advancing
the political process.

Through the adoption today of resolution 2440
(2018), the Council has extended the MINURSO
mandate for six months. We express our full support for
the initiative of the Personal Envoy, demonstrating his
determination to uphold the mandate of the Mission in
order to achieve a political solution to the issue. China's
position on the issue of Western Sahara has been
consistent. We will maintain an impartial and objective
position in support of the work of the United Nations
in promoting a political settlement, and encourage the
parties to seek a just, lasting and mutually acceptable
solution on the basis of the relevant Security Council
resolutions and through negotiations.
