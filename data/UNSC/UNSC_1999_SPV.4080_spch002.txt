Mr. Andjaba (Namibia): My delegation firmly
believes in the inalienable rights of the people of Western
Sahara to self-determination and independence. We also
believe that the United Nations Settlement Plan for Western
Sahara remains the only credible mechanism to achieve
this. This plan has the full support of the Organization of
African Unity.

With regard to our work of today, my delegation
would have preferred a technical resolution to extend the
mandate of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum
in Western Sahara to 29 February 2000, as recommended
by the Secretary-General. This would have been more
appropriate while we are awaiting a more comprehensive
report from the Secretary-General, on the occasion of
whose presentation the Council is expected to review the
overall situation regarding Western Sahara.
The draft resolution before us today, in our view,
does not represent faithfully the content of the last report
of the Secretary-General. Furthermore, it is selective in its
approach and ignores crucial concerns previously
expressed by the Council. An obvious example of this is
the omission of reference to the concern expressed by the
Council in resolutions 1238 (1999) and 1263 (1999),
which, inter alia, stated that the appeals process should
not be turned into a new round of identification.

Furthermore, it is our view that the draft resolution
paints a negative picture, which might negatively affect
the implementation of the settlement plan and would send
a wrong message to the international community.

It is for these reasons that my delegation cannot
support the draft resolution before us.
