Mr. Chen Xu (China) (spoke in Chinese): To begin
we would like to thank the Secretary-General for his
report and Assistant Secretary-General Annabi for his
additional briefing.

The peace process of Tajikistan has yielded
significant progress. The United Nations Mission of
Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) has become another
success story. This shows that the political will of the
parties concerned and the forceful support of the
international community are the indispensable
prerequisites for any success in peacekeeping operations.

As was pointed out by the Secretary-General in his
report, the peace process in Tajikistan has not been a
smooth one. During the process there were grave crises.
However, the Government and political parties of
Tajikistan demonstrated their commitment to the peace
agreement, solved their differences through dialogue,
overcame many obstacles and eventually embarked on the
path towards national reconciliation and democracy. This
is particularly precious for the people of Tajikistan, who
suffered through many years of war.

The Chinese delegation places great value on the
enormous efforts made by the international community in
general, and by the United Nations, the Contact Group of
Guarantor States and International Organizations and
Russia in particular. As the mandate of UNMOT will be
expiring soon, we support the Secretary-General in his
continued consultations with the Government of Tajikistan
aimed at exploring what role the United Nations can play
in the process of post-conflict peace-building and
consolidation.

Before concluding, the Chinese delegation would
like to state that it supports the draft presidential
statement proposed by the Russian Federation.
