The President: In accordance with rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite the representative of the Syrian Arab Republic to participate in this meeting. The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. Members of the Council have before them documents S/2020/24 and S/2020/25, each of which contains the text of a draft resolution. The Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolutions before it. I now call on those members of the Council who wish to make statements before the voting.
