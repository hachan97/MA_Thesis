My delegation would like to thank France for its hard work in facilitating the negotiation process and accommodating the various views of the Council members. Indeed, it was not an easy process, and Indonesia is pleased that a compromise could be reached. My delegation voted in favour of resolution 2539 (2020), and we wish to re-emphasize the important and positive role of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), in cooperation with the Lebanese Armed Forces, in maintaining stability across the Blue Line and the region. UNIFIL's key role in preventing conflicts and reducing tensions must not be taken for granted. Indonesia believes that the high expectations and demands placed upon UNIFIL and its peacekeepers must also be met with realistic and achievable mandates, including adequate and timely resources. In addition, all parties must firmly abide by their obligation to respect the safety and security of UNIFIL personnel. With regard to the UNIFIL assessment, we look forward to receiving a detailed plan from the Secretary-General to implement the recommendations of the assessment. As stated clearly in the resolution, full and close consultation with Lebanon and the troop-contributing countries (TCCs) is necessary in elaborating the plan. In that regard, meaningful coordination between the Secretariat and Lebanon, as well as the TCCs, is vital, particularly in further discussing various details and technical and operational elements of the recommendations. In conclusion, Indonesia wishes to reiterate its strong support for the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon.
