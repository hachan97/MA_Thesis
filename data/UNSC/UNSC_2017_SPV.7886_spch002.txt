Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian delegation is grateful for the
warm words and expressions of condolence on Russia's
irreparable loss of Ambassador Vitaly Churkin. We
have lost an outstanding diplomat, a great professional,
a talented orator and polemicist, and a soulful and
kind-hearted person. He had encyclopedic knowledge
that he often applied in practice, delving into the finer
points of all issues discussed. Working at the forefront
of international diplomacy and occupying the most
critical posts, Vitaly Ivanovich defended the positions
of his country for more than 40 years.

Thanks to his talent and brilliant mind, he often
found solutions to what seemed to be impossible
situations. He always sought ways to unify efforts and
strike a balance ofinterests, while carefully listening to
the Views of his partners in debates. That is why he was
respected by all who worked with him, even those who
may not have agreed with his approach. The hundreds
of calls and letters of condolence that continue to flow
into the Russian Mission bear witness to that.

Vitaly Ivanovich will always remain in our memory
as a principled diplomat of the highest calibre, a leader
who demanded much but also upheld the highest
standards. I again thank everyone for their kind words.
