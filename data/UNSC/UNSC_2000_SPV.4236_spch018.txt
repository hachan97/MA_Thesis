The President: I will now make a brief statement
in my national capacity.

It is specifically on behalf of the Netherlands that
I wish to express my heartfelt thanks to Sergio Vieira
de Mello. It is probably the last time that the
Netherlands as a member of the Security Council will
hear him report on East Timor, and he and his staff of
dedicated people are doing a superb job in the face of
enormous challenges which, as Ambassador Soderberg
pointed out, are rarely reported in the press because the
operation is going so well.

It is clear from the report of the Security Council
mission and from Mr. Vieira de Mello's briefing today
that the international community will have to sustain
its commitment to East Timor for some time to come.
We therefore fully agree with the draft presidential
statement submitted by the United Kingdom - which
statement underlines the need for a strong international
commitment to East Timor after independence, inter
alia, through the provision of financial, technical and
security assistance.

This month the Dutch presidency has devoted
special attention to exit strategies - that is, to the
question of how to wind up a peace operation after its
objective has been realized. It is clear that the theme is
also very relevant for East Timor. Not so long ago my
delegation expressed its concern about the tendency of
some of us - both Member States and those within the
Secretariat - to underestimate the time it will take for
East Timor to be able to face all the challenges of an
independent State, including external security, on its
own. We are relieved to note that in this respect there
has been a striking change of heart. We welcome the
new atmosphere of realism. Only by being both
committed and realistic can we hope to bring the East
Timor operation to a successful conclusion.

I will now resume my function as President of the
Council and give the floor to Mr. Vieira de Mello to
respond to comments and questions from members of
the Council.
