Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian delegation voted in favour
of resolution 2287 (2016), given the importance of
maintaining consensus in the Council on the issue of
an Abyei settlement and of pursuing the activities of
the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei in
upholding peace and stability in that region.

At the same time, we cannot support the impulse
driving several delegations to raise ad infinitum the
issue of appointing a civilian head of the peacekeeping
mission, as reflected in the twenty-seventh preambular
paragraph of the resolution. The Government of the
Sudan does not agree to such an appointment and its
views cannot be ignored. Even the very name of mission
in Abyei speaks against appointing a civilian head. We
recall that basic peacekeeping principles require United
Nations peacekeeping operations be deployed with the
consent of the parties to the conflict. That requires the
assent of all interested parties, including the Sudan, to
any change in the mission's leadership, especially as in
this case it falls under Chapter VI of the Charter of the
United Nations.
