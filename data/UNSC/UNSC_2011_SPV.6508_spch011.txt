The President (spoke in Chinese): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the Permanent
Representative of China.

China voted in favour of resolution 1975 (2011),
which was just adopted. China is seriously concerned
at the continuing deterioration in the security situation
in Cote d'Ivoire. We call on all Ivorian parties to
immediately cease all violence and armed
confrontations, and to seek to settle their differences
through dialogue and consultations.

We believe that the crisis caused by the elections
in Cote d'Ivoire must be addressed through peaceful
means. We appreciate and support the efforts made by
the African Union and the Economic Community of
West African States to find a political settlement to the
crisis. We call on all Ivorian parties to show active and
comprehensive cooperation.

China's position regarding the International
Criminal Court remains unchanged.

China always believes that United Nations
peacekeeping operations should strictly abide by the
principle of neutrality. We hope that the United Nations
Operation in Cote d'Ivoire will fulfil its mandate in a
strict and comprehensive manner, help to peacefully
settle the crisis in care d'Ivoire and avoid becoming a
party to the conflict.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Cote
d'Ivoire.
