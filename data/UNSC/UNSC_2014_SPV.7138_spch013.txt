Mr. Oh Joon (Republic of Korea): The Republic of
Korea voted in favour of the draft resolution contained
in document S/2014/189, as we firmly believe that the
unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine should be
fully respected and that the future of Ukraine should
be decided by the Ukrainians themselves without
any intervention or influence by outside forces. We
think that the draft resolution clearly embodies those
principles.

It is regrettable that the draft resolution was not
adopted by the Security Council today. Still, we very
much hope that today's failure will not close the window
on a peaceful and diplomatic solution to the crisis.
