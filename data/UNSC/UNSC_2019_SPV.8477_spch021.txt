The President (spoke in Spanish): There are no
more names inscribed on the list of speakers.

Before adjourning the meeting, as this is the
last scheduled meeting of the Council for the month
of February, I would like to express the sincere
appreciation of the delegation of Equatorial Guinea to
the members of the Council, especially my colleagues
the Permanent Representatives, their respective staff
and the Secretariat of the Council for all the support
they have given to us. Indeed, it has been a busy
month, and one in which we have rallied to consensus
on several important issues within our purview. We
could not have done it alone or without the hard work,
support and positive contributions of every delegation
and the representatives of the Secretariat, including the
conference service officers, interpreters, translators,
verbatim reporters and security staff. It has been a very
enriching experience for us and we apologize for any
difficulties that may have arisen

As we end our presidency, I know I speak on behalf
of the Council in wishing good luck to the delegations
of France and Germany during their joint presidency in
the months of March and April.

I now invite Council members to informal
consultations to continue our discussion on the subject.

The meeting rose at 6.40 pm.
