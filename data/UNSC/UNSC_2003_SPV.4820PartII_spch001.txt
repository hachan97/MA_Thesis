colleagues when I express our deepest sympathy over
the tragic murder of the Swedish Foreign Minister,
Anna Lindh.

Voting on draft resolution S/2003/824

The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, in which
he requests that he be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the discussion, without the right to vote,
in conformity with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Own
(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) took a seat at the
Council table.


The President: The Security Council will now
continue its consideration of the item on its agenda. In
doing so, the Council is continuing its meeting as
agreed on 9 September 2003.

Members of the Council have before them
document 8/2003/824, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Bulgaria and the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

I should also like to draw the Council's attention
to document S/2003/818, which contains the text of a
letter dated 15 August 2003 from the Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya, and document S/2003/819, which contains
the text of a letter dated 15 August 2003 from the
United Kingdom and the United States.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it
(S/2003/824). Unless I hear any objection I shall put
the draft resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chile, China,
Germany, Guinea, Mexico, Pakistan, Russian
Federation, Spain, Syrian Arab Republic, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland

Abstaining:
France, United States of America


The President: There were 13 votes in favour, no
votes against and two abstentions. The draft resolution
has therefore been adopted as resolution 1506 (2003).

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
