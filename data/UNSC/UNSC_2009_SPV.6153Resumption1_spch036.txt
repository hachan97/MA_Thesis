The President: I thank the Under-Secretaries-
General for the additional comments.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. Before I adjourn the meeting, I would like to thank
everyone for their participation in, and contribution to,
today's debate. I am particularly indebted to Under-
Secretaries-General Le Roy and Malcorra, as well as to
the representatives of the major troop, police and
financial contributors for their insightful and thought-
provoking comments and proposals. I am confident

that the views expressed today around the table will
contribute to the many parallel debates under way in
various forums. We particularly look forward to the
Secretariat's New Horizon non-paper, which will
constitute an important basis for our work ahead.

Last but not least, we remember fondly all the
United Nations peacekeepers who have lost their lives
in the line of duty.

With those thoughts, I shall now adjourn the
meeting.
