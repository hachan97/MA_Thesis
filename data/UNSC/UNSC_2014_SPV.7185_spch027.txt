Mr. Sergeyev (Ukraine) (spoke in Russian): I have
listened to the statement made by the representative of
the Russian Federation, and I believe that the easiest
way for his side to move forward would be as follows.
He has told us what we should do, so I should like to tell
him what Russia should do.

The Russian Government, the Minister for Foreign
Affairs or whoever makes the decisions should appeal
to their people, and first and foremost to the Chechen
leadership. Instead of conducting manoeuvres during
the presidential elections in Donetsk, those hundreds
of Chechens should immediately leave Ukraine. That is
the first requirement.

Secondly, with respect to the hundreds of Cossacks
in Ukraine, as I recall the President of the Russian
Federation took a decision regarding the presence of
the Russian army. The presence of those Cossacks is
therefore subject to a dual interpretation. It would thus
be only right for Russia to call on them, too, to leave
my country. Such an appeal could also be directed to
Russian citizens who, for lack of direction, sign on as
mercenaries. It would also be right to warn them against
acting on their impulses.

With respect to Crimea, we have been in contact
with the occupying Power concerning the issue of
water. This is an economic problem, but the most
pressing issue in Crimea has yet to be resolved. Crimea
is Ukrainian territory, and we must resolve the issue
of its restoration to Ukraine. That is our principled
position. No one is rejecting Crimea. That is an issue
we could consider together in negotiations.
