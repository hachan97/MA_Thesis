Mr. Arias (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): I should
like to join in welcoming to this Council His
Excellency Mr. Dileita Mohamed Dileita, Prime
Minister of Djibouti, and in acknowledging the
presence here of the Permanent Representative of
Eritrea and the representatives of the African Union
and of the League of Arab States. I should also like to
express our thanks for the briefing we have received
today from Mr. Joao Honwana of the Department of
Political Affairs.

The Council is meeting today at the request of the
Government of Djibouti for the purpose of assessing
the serious situation on the border between Djibouti
and Eritrea, where confrontations have recently
occurred between the armed forces of the two
countries.

In that connection, allow me to outline Panama's
position. The United Nations and each and every one
of its Member States are called upon to respect the
territorial integrity of States, and that includes
respecting their borders. When two neighbouring States
dispute the location of borders, the dispute should be
resolved through bilateral negotiations. If an agreement
cannot be reached between the two parties, they should
submit the dispute to the International Court of Justice.
In the event of any dispute that might jeopardize
international peace and security, this Council is called
upon to act to prevent the dispute from escalating into
armed conflict. To that purpose, the Security Council
should use all means at its disposal, including dialogue,
participation and collaboration between Member
States.

We thus appeal to both parties to withdraw the
military forces that have recently been deployed on the
border and immediately to initiate bilateral dialogue,
making use of the good offices and mechanisms
provided by the United Nations and other relevant
international bodies. Likewise, Panama considers it
appropriate for the Secretary-General to keep the
Security Council informed of any developments in the
situation.
