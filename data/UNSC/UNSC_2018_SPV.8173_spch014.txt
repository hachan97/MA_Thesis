The President: As this is the last scheduled meeting
of the Security Council for the month of January, I would
like to reiterate the sincere appreciation of the delegation
ofKazakhstan to the members ofthe Council, especially
my colleagues the Permanent Representatives, their
respective staffs and the secretariat of the Council, for
all the support they have given to us. Indeed, it has been
a busy month, and one in which we rallied to consensus
on several important issues within our purview. We
could not have done it alone, or without the hard work,
support and positive contributions of every delegation
and the representatives of the Secretariat, as well as
all the conference service officers, interpreters and
security staff.

As we end our presidency, I know that I speak
on behalf of the Council in wishing the delegation
of Kuwait good luck in the month of February. As a
token of our appreciation, we have distributed to each
delegation photographs to commemorate our work
together and limited-edition commemorative stamps.

The meeting rose at 11.35 am.
