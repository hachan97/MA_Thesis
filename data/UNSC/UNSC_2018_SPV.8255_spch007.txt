The President: I thank Ambassador Pierce for
her briefing.

On behalf of the Council, I should like to express
appreciation to all the members of the Security
Council and the Secretariat who participated in the
mission for the manner in which they discharged their
important responsibilities.

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements.
