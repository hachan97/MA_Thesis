Mr. DeLaurentis (United States of America): I
would like to thank Mr. Nqakula for travelling to New
York to brief the Council on the latest developments in
the peace process.

The United States calls on the PALIPEHUTU-
FNL to return to the negotiating table, refrain from any
further violence and implement its agreement with the
Government of Burundi by 31 December. We are
encouraged by President Nkurunziza's recent efforts to
reach out to the political opposition in Burundi, which
culminated in the allotment of several ministerial
positions to opposition parties in November.

The United States congratulates Union pour le
progres national (UPRONA) member of parliament
Yves Sahinguvu, the new First Vice-President. We trust
that President Nkurunziza and he will work together to
establish greater political cohesion and to focus on the
problems facing the country. The United States
commends the work of the African Union and United
Nations Integrated Office in Burundi (BINUB) in
facilitating the implementation of the ceasefire
agreement between the Government of Burundi and the
FNL and in providing support for the alleged FNL
dissidents located in two camps north of Bujumbura.
The United States also welcomes the efforts of
the Peacebuilding Commission in creating an
integrated strategy for peacebuilding in Burundi. We

strongly support the Peacebuilding Commission's work
in implementing that strategy to produce tangible,
sustainable results for the long term, and to prevent a
reversion to conflict.
