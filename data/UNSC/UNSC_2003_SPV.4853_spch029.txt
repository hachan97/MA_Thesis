The President: I know that I speak for all
members of the Council when I say that we appreciate
your having appeared before us and briefed us this
morning and responded in such a forthright way to the
various questions that were raised. We wish to
commend you on the excellent start that you appear to
have undertaken with respect to the exercise of your
important responsibilities, and we know that the
mission of leading the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo is in extremely
good hands.

The meeting rose at 1.05 pm.
