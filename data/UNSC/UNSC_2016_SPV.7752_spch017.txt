Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
position of China on resolution 2303 (2016), which
has just been adopted, is quite clear. Our starting
point is the fact that the fundamental interests of the
Government and the people of Burundi and those of the
Governments and people of the African continent as a
whole should be protected. The Council is an important
organ of the United Nations system. We need to have a
responsible attitude towards the people of Burundi, and
the Council should be cautious in dealing with these
extremely important matters.

The Security Council, during its discussions,
must take an inclusive approach and take into account
the views of the international community. As we
see it, the positions of other countries should not be
distorted in this Chamber. To do so is inappropriate
and irresponsible; it certainly does not contribute to the
common efforts of the Council to help the people and
the Government of Burundi to resolve their problems.
