Mr. Legwaila (Botswana): The resolution the
Security Council has just adopted is of fundamental
importance to the peace process in Liberia and to the
Liberian people, who have lost control of their country to
the rule of the gun. The extension of UNOMIL's
mandate to 30 June 1995 is possibly Liberia's last chance.
It is our sincere hope that the factions and political
leaders there will understand the message very clearly.

My delegation wholeheartedly welcomes the efforts
of Heads of State of the Economic Community of West
African States in the search for peace in Liberia. We
hope that the summit meeting planned for 10 May 1995
will be successful in bringing peace to that ravaged
country. We shudder to imagine what will happen to
Liberia if the various factions once again fail to
cooperate.
