Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We welcome the adoption of resolution 2402
(2018), on the extension of the mandate of the Panel
of Experts on Yemen mandated by Security Council
resolution 2342 (2017) and the renewal of sanctions
pursuant to resolution 2140 (2014), and we thank
all the delegations that supported it. Its unanimous
adoption creates an opportunity for further joint work
on reaching a settlement for Yemen and improving
the situation in the region in general. We assume that
the Panel will continue to carefully investigate the
information on rockets launched against Saudi Arabian
territory, which we condemn in the strongest terms.

We stress once again that we need a united approach
from all international and regional stakeholders,
including, needless to say, Saudi Arabia and Iran, if we
are to deal with the fundamental issues in the region.
The Russian Federation supports and values its relations
with all the Arab States, including Saudi Arabia and
Iran, and we will continue to build on those relations
with the aim of improving the situation in the region,
where peace must, ultimately, be established.

I would like to respond to the United States
representative's remarks. We withheld our support to
draft resolution S/2018/156, proposed by the United
Kingdom, not because we wanted to kill it by any
means possible, but because we were unable to reach
agreement on the wording of a few specific but key
sections. I spoke about this earlier. After all, the goal
of the draft resolution is to extend the mandate of the
Panel of Experts on Yemen, not to hold Iran accountable
or attempt to cobble together an anti-Iran coalition. The
United States representative's statement showed that
our concerns in that regard were well founded. In any
event, we are grateful to all the members of the Council
for making the right decision today.
