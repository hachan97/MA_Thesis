The President: I thank Judge Pillay for her

International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.

I now give the floor to Ms. Del Ponte, Prosecutor

Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda, to whom the Council has extended an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure, so that she may brief the Council.
