Mr. Lowcock: You asked me a question, Sir, about
the basis on which we are assessing humanitarian need
in Venezuela, and I would be happy, if the Security
Council wished, to provide a written explanation of
how we do that. In summary, however, in the interest of
time, as I said in my statement, the work we have done
so far has been on the basis of all of the available data.
We have, in the best way we were able to in Venezuela,
applied our tried and tested methodology that we use
all over the world to assess humanitarian need. We have
applied our standard system for caveating and quality
controlling the use of the data and the judgments
we make on the data. Again, as I said earlier, we are
keen to sustain the consultations we have with the
Government and others, because the only basis for
principled humanitarian action as the situation evolves
is a serious and professional ongoing effort to assess
humanitarian need.
