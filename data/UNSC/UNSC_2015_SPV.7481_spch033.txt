Mr. Wilson (United Kingdom): I shall speak very
briefly just to say that this is a 20-year anniversary of
an event in which the United Nations as an institution
and the Council were deeply associated. It is therefore
absolutely vital and absolutely right that we have
focused on this. We were proud to hold the pen on the
draft resolution, and seeking to commemorate that
event in the way that we have tried to do today has
absolutely got to be the right thing to do.
