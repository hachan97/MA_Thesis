The President (spoke in French): The Security

Council has before it the text of a presidential

statement to be issued on behalf of the Council on the
subject of this meeting.

I thank the Council members for their valuable
contributions to the statement. In accordance with the
understanding reached among the members of the
Council, I shall take it that the members of the Security
Council agree to the statement, which will be issued as
a document of the Security Council under the symbol
S/PRST/2012/2.

It is so decided.

I now give the floor to Mr. Jose Madeira, Special
Representative of the Chairperson of the African Union
Commission for Counter-Terrorism Cooperation.
