Mr. Allen (United Kingdom): Let me join others
in congratulating you, Madam President, on assuming
the presidency of the Security Council. I would like to

say straight out that we support the ambition you have
shown, Madam, in your provisional programme of
work, and we are very happy with it. As all of us tend to
do during our presidencies, I note that the United States
has proposed a thematic debate, this one on corruption
and conflict, which I think will be very interesting for
us to consider. We support it completely on that.

The main focus of our conversation today has
been on Nicaragua, where we have seen many lives
lost and increased refugee claims in the region. The
United Kingdom, as part of its presidency, hosted an
open debate last week (see S/PV.8334) on mediation
and the importance of that element of the agenda in our
preventive toolbox. I therefore think it is right that as
a Council we are considering those issues and thinking
about how we can support countries in the region.

The representative of Peru mentioned the regional
dimension. I would also like to point to Article 34 of
the Charter of the United Nations, which states very
clearly that the Security Council may investigate any
dispute or situation that might lead to international
friction or give rise to a dispute, in order to determine
whether the continuation of the dispute or situation is
likely to endanger the maintenance of international
peace and security. It is therefore clear to me that this
is a proper subject for debate. The United Kingdom
supports the United States fully, and I would encourage
our colleagues in the Council to agree to having those
discussions and a debate. That is what we are here for. I
would also encourage the Government of Nicaragua to
come to that meeting in a constructive spirit and focus
on its vision for an inclusive and mediated solution.
