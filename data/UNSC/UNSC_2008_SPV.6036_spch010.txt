Mr. Mantovani (Italy): At the outset, I would
like to thank Ambassador Grauls for his comprehensive
briefing and for his effective leadership of the Security
Council Committee established pursuant to resolution
1737 (2006).

Unfortunately, the most recent report of the
Director General of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) confirms Iran's non-compliance with
the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the
IAEA Board of Governors. Italy remains committed to
resolving the Iranian nuclear issue through a dual-track
approach, based on dialogue and the full
implementation of Security Council resolutions 1737
(2006), 1747 (2007), 1803 (2008) and 1835 (2008).

The French delegation's intervention just
highlighted the initiatives undertaken by the European
Union to that end, which Italy firmly supports. At the
same time, we wish to reaffirm the importance of the
political dimension, which is prominent in the package
of incentives offered to Tehran, as an essential means
to overcome the current stalemate and to strengthen
regional stability by actively involving all actors
concerned.
