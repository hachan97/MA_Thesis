Mr. Konuzin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): My delegation thanks our colleagues,
Ambassadors Jones Parry, De La Sabliere and Gaspar
Martins, for their briefing on the Security Council
mission to West Africa. I am sure that the visit was a
useful one. This year, unfortunately, my delegation was
unable to participate in the mission. Therefore,
following the oral briefing, I should like to ask a few
specific questions.

With respect to the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire, did
the constitutional Government of the country ask for
assistance from the Security Council in settling the
conflict with the rebels? If so, what was the nature of
the request and how did the mission respond to it?

As to the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, what was
the mission's impression of the military's preparedness
for restraint and not to interfere in the country's
constitutional regime? The mission met with the
military last year and was assured that the military
respected the Constitution, and yet there was a coup
d'etat a few months later.

In Liberia, following thousands of murders, the
mass torture of women, and crimes committed in
connection with the recruitment and use of child
soldiers, did the mission feel that at least one criminal
may be punished in actual fact and not, as we have
seen thus far, with mere threats?
