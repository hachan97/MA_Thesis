The President: I think we should acknowledge
the increasing role played by the African Union, the
Economic Community of West African States and other
regional and subregional bodies in addressing various
conflict situations in Africa. Long-term stabilization is
an important issue that merits greater attention and
interaction among African and other regional
organizations that can contribute their share. The
European Union is a good example in that regard.

I now call on Nana Effah-Apenteng,
representative of the Chairman of the Economic
Community of West African States.
