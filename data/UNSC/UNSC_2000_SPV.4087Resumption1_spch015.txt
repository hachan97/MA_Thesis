The President: Thank you, Mr. Ambassador,
particularly for the insight into your own country's dealing
with this problem. I would call everyone's attention to the
fact that the Ambassador concluded with a proposal that
we consider a General Assembly session on this issue at
a later date.

It is now my pleasure to call on another new
member of the Security Council, the representative of
Mali, Ambassador Ouane. Welcome to the Security
Council, Mr. Ambassador.
