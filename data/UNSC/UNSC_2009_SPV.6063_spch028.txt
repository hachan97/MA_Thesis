Mr. Mayr-Harting (Austria): Austria believes
that there was an urgent need for this formal call by the
Council for an immediate, permanent and fully
respected ceasefire. We also believe that it was
essential to preserve the unity of the Council regarding
this important matter that is of concern to the entire
world. We therefore are grateful for the efforts
undertaken, in particular by the United Kingdom,
France, the United States, Libya and the group of Arab
countries represented here, which made this consensus
possible.

There must be an unconditional halt to all rocket
attacks out of Gaza on Israel, as well as to all military
action by Israel in Gaza. For this reason, Austria
believes that today's decision must be followed up as
rapidly as possible by the establishment of the
guarantees and arrangements mentioned in today's
resolution. We actively support the international efforts
under way to make this possible.

Another priority is the lasting and sustained
opening of the border crossings so that we can come to
09-20414
grips with the ever more desperate humanitarian
situation affecting the population in Gaza.

Finally, like Mexico, Austria would draw the
Council's attention to one point not explicitly
mentioned in today's resolution but that is of key
importance: the obligation of all parties to respect
human rights law and humanitarian law. The
developments of recent days and of today in particular
have shown how important that is.
