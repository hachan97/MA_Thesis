Mr. Mahbubani (Singapore): You have asked us
to be brief, Mr. President. We will be brief, but we
hope that the brevity of our statement is not in any way
taken as an indication of the depth of the shock, horror
and outrage that we feel about yesterday's
developments.

By any standards, what happened yesterday was a
great tragedy. We join our colleagues in conveying our
deepest condolences to the victims and their families
and to the people and Government of the United States
of America. Both the President and the Prime Minister
of Singapore have conveyed the condolences of
Singapore to President George W. Bush.

We also join others in strongly condemning these
acts of terrorism. We have consistently taken the
position that terrorism anywhere should not be
condoned for any reason whatever.

What happened yesterday also demonstrates
clearly that the international community has to come
together to react to such terrorism. Several proposals
have been tabled this morning for a stronger
international response. We support all these responses,
and we hope that the Security Council will come
together and deliver a very effective response to ensure
that the events of yesterday are not repeated.

We also join our colleagues in supporting the
draft resolution before us.
