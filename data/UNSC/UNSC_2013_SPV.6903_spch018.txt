The President: It is my understanding that the
Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft
resolution before it (S/2013/27). I would like to thank
all Council members for co-sponsoring the draft
resolution, which is now a presidential text. It is a
most fitting tribute to the United Nations and to our
peacekeepers. I shall put the draft resolution to the vote
now.

A vote was taken by a show ofhands.

In favour:
Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, China, France,
Guatemala, Luxembourg, Morocco, Pakistan,
Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Rwanda,
Togo, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and United States of America

The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 2086 (2013).

I wish to request all speakers to limit their statements
to no more than four minutes in order to enable the
Council to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations
with longer statements are kindly requested to circulate
the texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version
when speaking in the Chamber.

I now give the floor to the representative of Egypt.
