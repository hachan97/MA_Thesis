Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria) (spoke in French): I
should like to begin by thanking Mr. James Morris for
his excellent and comprehensive briefing, which
reflected an integrated approach to matters of peace,
development and human dignity.

Mr. Morris began his briefing by quoting
President Obasajo, who said that a hungry person is an
angry person. For my part, I should like to quote a
famous French politician, who said that a dissatisfied
person is a poor person who thinks.

My country believes that while hunger has
cyclical causes such as drought and poor resource
management, structural causes are also involved. I do
not wish to repeat what was said this week during the
debate in the General Assembly, which is continuing in
the high-level segment of the Economic and Social
Council, because we believe that those two bodies are
better equipped than the Security Council to identify
obstacles and propose solutions.

Nonetheless, I believe that, with respect to
structural causes, issues related to international
governance, food production and the weakening of
agriculture in developing countries due to the unfair
practice of developed countries' providing huge
subsidies are relevant to this debate.

With respect to the Security Council's mandate, I
should like to express our agreement with Mr. Morris's
View that food should never become an instrument of
war or of diplomatic coercion, regardless of how a
Government may be Viewed. Our hope is that the
members of the Security Council will, in the course of
this debate, hear a reaffirmation of that cardinal moral
principle.

In conclusion, I should like to express Algeria's
appreciation for the efforts that the WFP is deploying
in Africa, in particular in support of the objectives of
the New Partnership for Africa's Development, and for
the efforts it is making at the international level. It can
rest assured of our support.
