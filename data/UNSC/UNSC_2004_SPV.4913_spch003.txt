The President (spoke in Chinese): I thank
Mr. Guehenno for his briefing.

I wish to recall that there are 30 speakers
scheduled for this morning. Many of them have
indicated to me that they do not wish to speak at
another meeting. Therefore, in accordance with the
understanding reached among Council members, I wish
to remind all speakers that, other than Under-Secretary-
General Guehenno and Foreign Minister Ramos-Horta
of Timor-Leste, representatives' statements will be
limited to no more than five minutes in order to enable
the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to circulate their texts in writing and to
deliver condensed versions when speaking in the
Chamber. 1 thank them for their understanding and
cooperation.
I now call on the representative of Brazil.
