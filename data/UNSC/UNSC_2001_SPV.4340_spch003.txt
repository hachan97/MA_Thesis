The President: I thank Mr. Adeniji for his
comprehensive and very useful briefing. I believe it has
given us along with the report of the Secretary-
General, some very important aspects and points which
need to be addressed by the members of the Council.

As I now proceed to give the floor to the
members of the Council, my appeal and request to
them would be that they be focused in their statement,
rather than elaborating a long speech on their policy
towards Sierra Leone, and address the points that the
report of the Secretary-General and Mr. Adeniji have
raised. I think that it will serve the purpose of the
debate better if we do so. At some given points, I shall
come back to Mr. Adeniji for a response to the points
raised by the members of the Council.
