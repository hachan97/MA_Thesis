Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese):
Mr. President, I welcome you in presiding over today's
meeting. China welcomes the Security Council's
unanimous adoption of resolution 2307 (2016),
authorizing the United Nations mission in Colombia.

The Government of Colombia and the Fuerzas
Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia reached a
final peace agreement in August, which will soon be
formally signed and which represents major progress
in Colombia's peace process. China wishes to extend
its congratulations in that connection and to express
its appreciation for the efforts of the Colombian
Government and other countries, including Venezuela,
Cuba, Chile and Norway, in that connection.

The signing of the final peace agreement will
provide lasting peace and stability to the Colombian
people and promote the peace and stability of the entire
region. It will also have a positive ripple effect on the
search for solutions to other regional hotspot issues.
The Council's unanimous adoption of resolution 2307
(2016) is conducive to stepping up the deployment
of the United Nations political mission in Colombia,
facilitating the implementation of the monitoring and
verification mechanism, and further promoting the
peace process in Colombia.

China hopes that the UnitedNations will, on the basis
of respect for Colombia's sovereignty, independence and
territorial integrity, work to strengthen communication
and coordination with the Colombian Government,
facilitate the early deployment of the mission, help the
parties in Colombia in fully implementing the ceasefire
agreement and the final peace agreement, and provide
constructive assistance to Colombia to ensure a smooth
implementation of the peace process.
