The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter, dated 15 March 1996, from
the Permanent Representative of Guinea-Bissau to the
United Nations, which will be issued as document
S/1996/ 196, and reads as follows:

"I have the honour to request you that during
the meeting of the Security Council devoted to the
Consideration of the Situation in Somalia, the
Council extend an invitation, under Rule 39 of the
Provisional Rules of Procedure, to HE.
Mr. Ibrahima Sy, Permanent Observer of the
Organization of African Unity to the United
Nations."

 

If I hear no objection, I shall take it that the Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 to His
Excellency Mr. Ibrahima Sy.
It is so decided.
