Mr. Llorentty Soliz (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): At the outset, I would
like to thank you, Mr. President, for the way in which
you are conducting the work of this unusual meeting
of the Council. We believe it is important that the
text of the draft resolution (S/2017/968) that we are
submitting be put before members of the Council for
their consideration. We do not need to apologize for
having recourse to the provisional rules of procedure
of the Council.

At the same time, we wish to make it clear that
we wish the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative
Mechanism to continue its work and we also want to
address the concerns of other members of the Security
Council. With that, my delegation would like to ask
Security Council members for their support to the
draft resolution.
