The Russian Federation abstained in the voting on resolution 2556 (2020), on the mandate renewal of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, submitted by France. We cannot agree with the new wording of the paragraphs on international humanitarian assistance proposed by the authors, which dilutes the relevant United Nations guiding principles contained in General Assembly resolution 46/182. We regard the guiding principles as the only universal basis for the work of all international humanitarian organizations and donors. They capture the imperative to ensure respect for the sovereignty of States recipients of humanitarian aid. We believe that they need to be duly reflected in documents of the Security Council. We regret that the French penholder of the Congolese dossier deemed it appropriate to ignore the legitimate interests and priorities of a fellow member of the Security Council and sacrifice consensus for the sake of controversial innovations on this highly sensitive issue. It is particularly sad that this took place amid the current complex political momentum regarding the Democratic Republic of the Congo, at a time when Kinshasa so badly needs a unified signal of support from the Security Council.
