Mr. Manongi (United Republic of Tanzania):
Our statement will be circulated, so I should just like to
make five points.

The first is to express deep regret at the recent
negative developments in Timor-Leste.

The second is to commend the quick action taken
by the Secretary-General not only in consulting leaders
in the region and maintaining contacts with countries
that had committed to sending forces to help restore
stability, but also in deciding to send his Special
Envoy. The Envoy's message that this was not a
moment for despair, but a time for the people and
leaders of Timor-Leste as well as the international
community to act together, deserves our collective
support.

Thirdly, we applaud Australia, Malaysia, New
Zealand and Portugal for their response in sending
forces to help in the restoration of order and stability,

as well as those who responded and continue to
respond to the existing humanitarian challenges.

Fourthly, we appeal to the Timorese leadership to
take urgent action to begin addressing the root causes
of the conflict, including heeding the Secretary-
General's message that any corrective measures must
be pursued within the framework of the Constitution.
We welcome the establishment of an independent
commission of enquiry.

Lastly, the relapse of Timor-Leste is tragic. In
hindsight, it can now be said that the Timor-Leste
peacekeepers were pulled out too soon. We can,
however, remedy that by supporting Timor-Leste while
it heals its wounds and by helping the country to
address the social and economic problems it faces.
Timor-Leste needs an enhanced and extended United
Nations presence. This Council can help make that
possible. The United Republic of Tanzania will support
such efforts.
