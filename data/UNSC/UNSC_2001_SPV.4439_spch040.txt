The President (spoke in French): I thank the
representative of Sierra Leone for his kind words
addressed to me. I invite him to resume the seat
reserved for him at the side of the Council Chamber.

I now give the floor to Mr. Ibrahima Fall so that
he can respond to the comments that have been made
and the questions that have been addressed to him.
