Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The negative impact on the implementation
of the Package of Measures for the Implementation of
the Minsk Agreements, which remains the only option
for resolving the situation in south-eastern Ukraine, is
exacerbated by overall instability in the country, the
exploitation of the Donbas factor to foment internal
political strife and the rise of radical and extremist
forces that are condoned by the authorities.

More and more often, it is the weapons in the hands
of the extremists that are becoming the instruments
that settle conflicts, and the country's authorities
are incapable of prosecuting the trafficking of those
weapons. In that regard, we would like to draw
the Council's attention to the fact that, according
to data published in April by the independent
non-governmental organization the Small Arms
Survey, the volume of illegally traded small arms in
Ukraine stood at approximately 3 million units in 2013.
The 2014 coup d'etat only exacerbated the situation.
It was under the passive eye of the coupists that army
depots were looted - which was well documented in
the media - including in western areas of the country,
and small arms and light weapons were distributed
willy nilly to the extremists, who were subsequently
legalized by their inclusion in the country's armed
forces. In that regard, we hope that the Kyiv authorities
fulfil their international obligation to control the
circulation of small arms and light weapons and take
the necessary measures to combat their illegal trade.
