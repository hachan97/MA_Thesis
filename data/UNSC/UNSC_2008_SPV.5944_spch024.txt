Mr. Zannier: I would just like briefly to refer to
one issue raised by Foreign Minister Jeremie in his
statement, which has to do with the findings
concerning allegations that excessive force was used
on 17 March against Kosovo Serb demonstrators in the
town of Mitrovica. I wish to inform him that the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations will organize
a briefing for concerned Member States on that issue
next week.
