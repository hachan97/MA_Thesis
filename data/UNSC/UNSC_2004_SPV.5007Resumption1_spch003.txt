The President: We appreciate the
institutionalized framework of consultations between
the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the
United Nations. I would also like to welcome the
excellent work done in the context of the dialogue
among civilizations and "enlightened moderation". I
also welcome the fact that the ministerial meeting of
the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the
European Union is scheduled to take place in Istanbul
in the next few weeks.
