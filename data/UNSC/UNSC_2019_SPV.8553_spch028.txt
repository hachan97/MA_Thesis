Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): So I now see that I have only just understood
the real point of the question and the answer. It turns
out that hospitals whose coordinates are known must
not be bombed, but carpet bombing that wipes hospitals
off the face of the earth is all right. That is how I
understood my British colleague's statement.

In answer to his question, I have already said that
we have serious doubts about the statistics that have
been provided about the medical facilities that have
been destroyed. We have raised that question not just
in the Chamber but also in dialogue with our United
Nations colleagues, and we have not had a clear or
trustworthy answer. How reliable are the statistics
provided? We were told that the statistics confirming
the destruction of hospitals in various areas that had
been bombed are based on the testimony of certain
trustworthy individuals with links to the World Health
Organization (WHO), who provide the WHO with
data that has not been confirmed by anyone else but
which forms the basis for the statistics that have been
presented to us here. We are not convinced by that. That
is my answer to the question, and we will continue to
try to obtain information concerning the basis for the
statistics that officials of the United Nations 7 and
they are high-ranking officials 7 are using as evidence
that we have heard about today and as the basis for the
accusations that some Member States have made.
