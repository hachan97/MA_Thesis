Mr. Gaspar Martins (Angola): My country
voted in favour of this resolution, as the concerns
expressed and proposed as amendments have been
taken into account - though not sufficiently. This is
not a perfect resolution; it is the possible resolution. It
is the hope of my delegation that by adopting
resolution 1559 (2004) the Security Council will be
able to make an effective contribution to the
strengthening of the political independence, territorial
integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon in its territorially
recognized borders. It is also our hope that its adoption
will not have undesirable and unexpected effects, since
the situation in Lebanon does not represent an
immediate threat to peace and security.

In the view of my delegation, the approach
adopted by the Security Council could have been better
balanced and could have taken into account very
delicate geostrategic realities of the region. The
Council could also take a more proactive role in the
search for a comprehensive solution to the problems
prevailing in the region. My delegation would have
preferred - as we expressed during the consultations
on the draft resolution - to seize the opportunity for
the Council to encourage the Governments of Lebanon
and Syria to conclude a bilateral agreement under the
auspices and guarantees of the Security Council. That
approach, in the view of my delegation, might better
safeguard the interests of all parties concerned and
better guarantee the attainment of the objectives set by
the international community, thus contributing to a
better way and defusing tensions prevailing in the
entire region.
