Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We are grateful to the Special Envoy of the
Secretary-General for Darfur, Mr. Eliasson, and to the
Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations,
Mr. Guehenno, for their comprehensive briefing on
progress on the political track of a settlement in Darfur
and the deployment of the African Union-United
Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID).

We are convinced that a settlement in Darfur lies
exclusively in the political sphere through negotiations
between the Government of the Sudan and Darfur
rebels. New peace agreements between Khartoum and
the Darfur opposition must become the future support
structure for the restoration of peace and security in the
Sudanese region.

We believe that resuming the negotiating process
launched in Sirt is a priority. Without success in the
Darfur-Darfur dialogue, it will be impossible to
improve the humanitarian situation and successfully to
ensure UNAMID's fulfilment of its mandate. We fully
subscribe to the calls regarding the need for a
comprehensive solution. We express our clear
commitment to work towards that in the Council.

In conclusion, Mr. President, allow me to say just
a few words on a personal level. I would like to thank
you and all my colleagues around the table for the nice
words extended to me, including the words of
encouragement in connection with my future position.
