The President: I thank Mr. Khare for his
statement.

On this occasion I must say that the fact that so
many speakers, from five regions of the world, took the
floor in this open debate on Timor-Leste is a
manifestation of strong interest and support by all
Member States regarding the future, the democracy and
the stability of Timor-Leste. It seems that unanimous
strong support was expressed for the continued
presence of the United Nations Integrated Mission in
Timor-Leste (UNMIT) and for an extension of its
mandate, as well as for the continued prosperity of
Timor-Leste.

I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of
my colleagues in the Council, to convey the deepest
possible appreciation to His Excellency President Jose
Ramos-Horta and his delegation for taking the trouble
to come to New York to attend this open debate on the
occasion of an extension of the mandate. I wish the
President good health and future success in his country.
I also express great appreciation to Deputy Secretary-
General Migiro for her patience and for staying with
the Council to show her solidarity with us.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my list.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 1.35 pm.
