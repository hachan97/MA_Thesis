The President: I thank Ms. Zerrougui for her
briefing. I also convey to her, on behalf of every member
of the Security Council, our strong support for the work
she does and for the efforts of the men and women in
the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, sometimes
under very difficult circumstances.

I now give the floor to Ambassador Alotaibi.
