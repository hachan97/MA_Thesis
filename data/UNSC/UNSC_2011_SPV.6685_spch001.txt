The President (spoke in Russian): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/201l/771, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by China, France, the
Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of
America.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to documents S/20ll/746 and S/20ll/746/Corr.l,
which contain the report of the Secretary-General on
the United Nations operation in Cyprus.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I should like to inform the Council that the
presidency of the Council has met with the
representatives of the parties, who have confirmed that
they maintain their well-known positions vis-a-vis the
item on the Council's agenda. On the basis of those
meetings, with the consent of the members of the
Council, the presidency has drawn the conclusion that
the Council can proceed to take a decision on the draft
resolution before it. IfI hear no objection, I shall put
the draft resolution to the vote now.

A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
Colombia, France, Gabon, Germany, India,
Lebanon, Nigeria, Portugal, Russian Federation,
South Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland and United States of
America

The President (spoke in Russian): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 2026 (2011).

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 10.20 am.
