Ms. Sison (United States of America): In response
to the last speaker's statement, I would like to take
this opportunity to thank Assistant Secretary-General
Mueller and the dedicated and brave teams of the
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(OCHA) and the United Nations agencies. They and
their implementing partners on the ground are saving
lives and helping the Syrian people every day, while the
Syrian Government continues to terrorize its people and
cause unimaginable suffering. OCHA has our support.
