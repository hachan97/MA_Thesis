I have the honour to refer to the draft resolution contained in document S/2020/852, submitted by Indonesia, in connection with the agenda item "Threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts". In accordance with the voting procedure set out in the letter dated 27 March 2020 (S/2020/253) from the President of the Security Council, a procedure agreed in the light of the extraordinary circumstances caused by the coronavirus disease pandemic, the draft resolution received 14 votes in favour, one against (the United States of America) and no abstentions. The draft resolution has not been adopted owing to the negative vote of a permanent member of the Council. Pursuant to that procedure, I enclose herewith copies of the related documents: My letter dated 28 August 2020, addressed to the Permanent Representatives of the members of the Security Council, putting to the vote the draft resolution contained in document S/2020/852 (annex | and enclosure); Letters received in response from the members of the Security Council indicating their national positions on the draft resolution (annexes 2 to 16); Statements subsequently submitted by members of the Security Council providing explanations of their votes (annexes 17 to 21). This letter and its enclosures will be issued as a document of the Security Council.
