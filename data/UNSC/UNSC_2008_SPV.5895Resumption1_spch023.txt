The President: I thank the representative of
Jamaica for that very important statement, which
included with a number of significant areas for follow-
up. We agree with the emphasis on bringing in the
General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council,
the Security Council and the Peacebuilding
Commission to address these questions.

I should just like to assure delegations that there
is no intention, either in the concept paper or beyond it,
to deviate or detract from funding for development.
What is proposed would be additional to existing
measures, in order to help address some of the
questions that the representative raised about post-
conflict situations.

I now call on the representative of Pakistan.
