Mr. Lucas (Angola): We start by thanking the
Egyptian presidency for convening this meeting.
The holding of open briefings by the Chairs of the
Sanctions Committees increases the transparency
of Security Council proceedings, which the United
Nations membership has been calling, for especially
in matters of great political sensibility, such as the
sanctions regimes.

We took note with appreciation of the briefings
provided by the Chairs of the Committee pursuant to
resolutions 1267 (1999), 1989 (2011) and 2253 (2015)
concerning Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant
(Da'esh), Al-Qaida and associated individuals, groups,
undertakings and entities; the Committee established
pursuant to resolution 1373 (2001) concerning counter-
terrorism; and the Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1540 (2004) - respectively, the Permanent
Representatives of New Zealand, Egypt and Spain.

We acknowledge the existence of organic
linkages and encourage the strengthening
of cooperation among the Sanctions and
Counter-Terrorism Committees, their respective groups
of experts and the Counter-Terrorism Committee
Executive Directorate (CTED), as well as among
United Nations specialized agencies, Member States
and the wider international community in dealing with
the impending threats to peace and security caused by
terrorism worldwide.
The holding of this meeting less than a month
after the debate on 14 April on threats to international
peace and security caused by terrorist acts (see S/PV.7670) demonstrates the Council's commitment to
combating the threat posed by terrorism in all its forms
and manifestations.

The report by the Chair of the 1267 Committee
highlights the expansion of the Islamic State in Iraq
and the Levant beyond Iraq and Syria, the shifting
of its centre of gravity due to military pressure,
with ensuing loss of territory and destruction of
different significant parts of its oil infrastructure.
A matter of great concern expressed in the report is
the return home to many foreign terrorist fighters and
the additional threat caused by those developments,
which as the Chair of the Committee stresses, pose
a greater risk to the international community and an
opportunity for improving the impact and effectiveness
of the 1267 (1999) sanctions regime, which has the
ultimate goal of degrading and destroying that lethal
terrorist organization.

Notwithstanding the fact that sanctions by
themselves are not enough to win the fight against
terrorism, it is imperative to strengthen global
international, regional and subregional cooperation,
as well as national capacities at all levels, and to find
creative ways to launch an ideological struggle to
successfully confront the terrorists. The phenomenon of
foreign terrorist fighters calls for enhanced cooperation
among States, international and regional organizations,
relevant United Nations bodies and partners to put an
end to the flow of foreign terrorist fighters, which is an
approach that should be at the centre of the Committees'
efforts and runs parallel with the activities employed by
the Counter-Terrorism Committees.

The guiding principles identified to assist Member
States in their efforts to stem the flow of foreign terrorist
fighters, the global surveys on the implementation
of resolution 1373 (2001), the use of information and
communication technologies for terrorist purposes, the
trends in terrorist financing and the efforts to cut the
flow of funds and undermine the terrorists' capacities
to exploit natural and economic resources in territories
under their control are matters identified in the Chair's
report as fundamental responses States should develop
for their security concerns.

Still concerning the report by the Chair of the
Counter-Terrorism Committee, we share his view on the
need to implement measures permitting the Committee
to act more rapidly and efficiently in its dialogue with
Member States by improving its responsiveness to their
needs based upon the principle of national ownership.

The extreme violence of acts perpetrated by the
terrorists substantiate that the realization of their
already proclaimed determination to make use of
weapons of mass destruction would be a development
of catastrophic dimensions, which as the Chair of the
1540 Committee reminds us, can be avoided only by
constantly vigilance by Member States to prevent
non-State actors from acquiring and using weapons
of mass destruction. It is against such a backdrop that
the 1540 Committee is undertaking a comprehensive
review on the implementation of resolution 1540
(2014) highlighting the need for continued vigilance at
national, regional and international levels, along with
sustained and intensified support from the Committee.
The priorities and the main thrust highlighted by the
Chair of the Committee of the comprehensive review
of the implementation ofresolution 1540 (2004) has our
support and encouragement by streamlining Security
Council efforts and strengthening cooperation and
effective coordination between the Committee and
overall framework set up to combat terrorism, including
the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the Sanctions
Committees related to terrorists activities.
