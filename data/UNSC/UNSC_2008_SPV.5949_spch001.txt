The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Iraq, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Al-Bayati
(Iraq) took a seat at the Council table.

The President (spoke in French): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the course of the
Council's prior consultations, I shall take it that the
Security Council agrees to extend an invitation under
rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure to
Mr. Lynn Pascoe, Under-Secretary-General for
Political Affairs.

It is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/495, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 6 of
resolution 1770 (2007). I wish to draw the attention of
members to document 8/2008/523, which contains the
text of a note verbale dated 4 August 2008 from the
Permanent Mission of Iraq transmitting a letter from
the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear
briefings by Mr. Lynn Pascoe, Under-Secretary-
2

General for Political Affairs, and by His Excellency
Mr. Alejandro Wolff, Deputy Permanent Representative
of the United States, on behalf of the Multinational
Force.

I now give the floor to Mr. Pascoe.
