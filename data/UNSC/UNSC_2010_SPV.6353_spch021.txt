Mr. Mugoya (Uganda): I wish to start by
congratulating you, Madam, on having assumed the
presidency of the Council for the month of July. I also
thank Ambassador Heller and the delegation of Mexico
for having ably presided over the Council during the
month of June.

I welcome His Excellency Mr. Boris Tadic',
President of the Republic of Serbia, and thank him for
his statement. I thank Special Representative of the
Secretary-General Lamberto Zannier for his briefing on
the situation in northern Kosovo. I also thank Mr. De
Kermabon of the European Union and Mr. Hyseni for
their statements.

We condemn the recent bombing attack in North
Mitrovica and deplore the resulting of loss of life and
injuries. It is important that the perpetrators of these
acts be brought to justice in order to prevent their
recurrence and to foster a sense of community among
the communities. We encourage all sides to remain
calm and to avoid any action that could exacerbate the
fragile security situation any further. We also call on
the parties to exercise restraint, mutual respect and
tolerance in the interest of peace.

It is important for the authorities in Kosovo to
desist from taking any unilateral action in northern
Kosovo that is of a provocative nature and could
further aggravate the situation. There is a need to
ensure adequate protection of the lives and property of
the minority populations in northern Kosovo. We call
on all the relevant players in the region to play their
part in promoting and safeguarding peace.

We welcome the continuing efforts of the United
Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo to

10-43 669
promote security and stability in Kosovo and the entire
region. We also commend the Mission for its work in
encouraging reconciliation and facilitating dialogue.
However, the recent incidents are a reminder of the
need for the parties to commit themselves to dialogue
and the implementation of resolution 1244 (1999).
