Mr. Polyanskiy (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I too would like to join in congratulating our
British colleagues on their presidency in August. They
had a difficult job and nonetheless handled it well. I
also wish you and your team every success, Madam
President. This too will be a complicated month. You
effectively lose a week to the general debate, but I
think with our collective efforts we can make headway
and discuss genuinely important issues pertaining to
international peace and security.

In that context, I wish to endorse my Bolivian
colleague's statement, which I felt made a very
compelling and persuasive argument. There is no
question that the Security Council should focus on
issues that pose a threat to international peace and
security, and in that regard, we see no such threat
from the situation in Nicaragua. Furthermore, we fear
that putting this item on the agenda of the Security
Council will only undermine the efforts being made
in Nicaragua to resolve the situation, and which of
course we fully support. Our hope is that you, Madam
President, will heed our views and that we can continue
to work together as a team and achieve success in areas
where we can make genuine progress.

I also want to note that we understand and are
familiar with the previously mentioned plans to hold
a high-level meeting on 26 September. We assume
that the discussion will take place in the context of the
implementation of resolution 2231 (2015). In our view,
the subject of Iran can be discussed only within that
framework. In particular, we very much hope that the
aspects linked to the withdrawal of the United States
from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action will
be discussed.
