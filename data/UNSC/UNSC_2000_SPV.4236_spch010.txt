Mr. Heinbecker (Canada) (spoke in French): I
begin by expressing the Canadian Government's
gratitude for the excellent work Mr. Vieira de Mello
has been doing, and continues to do, in East Timor. We
are pleased that the United Nations Transitional
Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) has
succeeded in reducing militia activity in East Timor.

(spoke in English)

We are encouraged by the return in recent weeks
of some 400 refugees from West Timor. We note that
UNTAET has developed appropriate contingency
plans, in coordination with humanitarian agencies, for
a significant return of refugees. In that regard, we note
that the Government of Indonesia has created a task
force to develop registration projects. We endorse the
Council mission's conclusion that to be credible those
exercises must be free from pro-integration influence
and include international personnel.

We agree with the emphasis Mr. Vieira de Mello
has placed on the development of a national police
force and on increasing judicial capacity. We are
pleased that the Fifth Committee has informally agreed
with the Secretary-General's proposal to strengthen
those components within the assessed UNTAET
budget. We look forward to the review of the needs of
the justice sector in East Timor, and agree that more
should be done on the basis of assessed resources,
given the scope of UNTAET's mandate.

We are pleased that arrests have been made in
relation to the murder of the three personnel of the
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) in Atambua on 6 September, and
that Indonesia has recently adopted legislation in
support of a national human rights tribunal.

I have one specific question for Mr. Vieira
de Mello. How does he assess prospects for an
agreement between the Government of Indonesia and
UNTAET on transit arrangements between the Oecussi
enclave and East Timor?
