The President (spoke in French): I thank the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General for his
statement. I also thank all of those who have been with
us to the very end of this long meeting, which by its
duration and the quality of all the statements made, has
emphasized the attention with which our Council is,
day after day and month after month, following the
difficult yet impressive progress accomplished on the
way to reconciliation and reconstruction in Kosovo.

On all our behalf, I wish to express our gratitude
to the Special Representative and through him to all the
teams surrounding him in the field.

There are no other speakers on my list. We have
thus concluded this stage of consideration of the item
on the agenda. The Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 2.10p.m.
