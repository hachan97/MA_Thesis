Mr. Denisov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation supported the
adoption of the Security Council resolution extending
the mandate of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force
in Cyprus (UNFICYP) until 15 June 2004.

That operation continues to play an important
role in maintaining stability and security on the island
of Cyprus. We agreed with the recommendations of the
Secretary-General regarding changes to the concept of
operations and the force level, taking into account the
fact that those changes reflect the situation in security
terms on the island and will not harm the activities of
the United Nations armed forces in carrying out their
mandate.

The Russian Federation continued to help in a
lasting settlement in Cyprus, in accordance with
Security Council resolutions, in particular resolution
1251 (1999) and other decisions of the Security
Council.

We agree on the importance of establishing a
favourable environment for the renewal of the
negotiation process, including through economic
relations between the two Cypriot communities. In that
regard, we must strictly observe the provisions of
Security Council resolutions 541 (1983) and 550 (1984).
