The President: I thank the representative of
Mauritania for his kind words addressed to me.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is Mr.
Hussein Hassouna, Permanent Observer for the League
of Arab States to the United Nations, to whom the
Council has extended an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure. I invite him to take a
seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
