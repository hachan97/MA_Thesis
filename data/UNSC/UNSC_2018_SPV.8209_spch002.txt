Mr. Kuzmin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): As far as I know, today's meeting was not
scheduled in the Security Council's agreed programme
of work for this month. Our delegation would be
extremely grateful to you, Mr. President, if you could
explain what exactly we are supposed to discuss at
today's meeting and whom the Council plans to invite
as briefers.
