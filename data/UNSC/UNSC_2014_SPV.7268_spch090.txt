Ms. Chan: I would first like to thank the
United States presidency of the Security Council for
organizing this timely debate on Ebola. I would also
like to thank the Council members and representatives
of other countries who spoke today for their outpouring
of support, political and otherwise, including in the
areas of human resources, expertise, material and
military assets. They are all very valuable to the efforts
to support the three countries affected - Guinea,
Sierra Leone and Liberia - in solidarity with them
and under their national leaderships. The unanimous
support for resolution (2177 (2014), with 130 sponsors,
is an unprecedented feat, and I would like to thank the
Council for its show of solidarity.

It also warmed my heart to hear the support ofso many
here for the Secretary-General's initiative in creating
a United Nations mission. The entire United Nations
family, working with various agencies in the system,
particularly the World Food Programme, UNICEF,
the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs and others, along with partners in the private
sector, civil society and important organizations such
as the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies and Medecins Sans Frontieres, will
do its utmost to conduct this massive surge with speed,
scale and efficiency, and without duplication. We look
forward to the Council's continued guidance and advice
on the way forward. Let us work together to end the
Ebola outbreak and kick it out of the African continent.
Once again, I thank all here. I am really touched by the
solidarity shown with these countries.
