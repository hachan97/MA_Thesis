The President: I thank the Chairman of the
Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the
Palestinian People for his kind words addressed to me, to
my predecessor and to other members of the Security
Council.

The next speaker on my list is the representative of
Jordan. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and
to make his statement.
