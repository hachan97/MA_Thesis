Ms. Siider (Sweden): When I arrived in New York
last night to take part in today's debate on European
security, I was met by the news that Ambassador Vitaly
Churkin had passed away. The Swedish Government,
our Permanent Representative Olof Skoog, who is
travelling, and I are deeply saddened by this news. I
would like to express our sincere condolences to the
family of Vitaly Churkin, to our colleagues in the
Mission, here represented by Mr. Iliichev, to the
Russian Government and to the people of the Russian
Federation.

On a personal note, let me say that I will certainly
miss the lively and fruitful conversations I had during
almost all of my visits here in New York in the last few
years. Vitaly Churkin will certainly be greatly missed.
