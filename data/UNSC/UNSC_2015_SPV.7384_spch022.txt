Ms. Power (United States of America): I just want
to be clear in response to my Russian colleague that the
United States wholeheartedly welcomes the agreement.
We will do all we can to support it. But if Russia is
committed to peace, it does not need a Security Council
resolution to prove it. There are actually easier ways
to prove it. Russia could stop arming the separatists;
stop sending hundreds of heavy weapons across the
border, in addition to Russian troops; stop pretending
that it is not doing what it is doing; and start calling on
and insisting that the separatists observe the ceasefire
around Debaltseve. Resolution or no resolution, What
matters is fulfilling the commitments that have been
made now multiple times. I assure him that we will be
the first to take notice, and it will actually be very easy
to see whether or not the commitments are being met.
