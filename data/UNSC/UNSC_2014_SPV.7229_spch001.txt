The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them document
S/2014/536, which contains the text ofa draft resolution
submitted by France, the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of
America.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members to
document S/2014/46l, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the United Nations operation in
Cyprus.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.

I should like to inform the Council that the presidency
of the Council has met with the representatives of the
parties, who have confirmed that they maintain their
well-known positions vis-a-vis the item on the Council's
agenda. On the basis of those meetings, with the
consent of the members of the Council, the presidency
has drawn the conclusion that the Council can proceed
to take a decision on the draft resolution before it.

IfI hear no objection, I shall put the draft resolution
to the vote now.

A vote was taken by Show ofhands.

In favour:
Argentina, Australia, Chad, Chile, China, France,
Jordan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Nigeria, Republic
of Korea, Russian Federation, Rwanda, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and United States of America

The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 2168 (2014).

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 10.10 am.
