Mr. Inchauste Jordan (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): At the outset, we
should like to highlight the work carried out by the
penholders, whose substantial efforts resulted in a text
that all members could support. Nevertheless, Bolivia
abstained in the voting due to changes in the situation
on the ground.

As a result of the Astana agreements, it was
possible to establish four de-escalation zones, reduce
violence on the ground and thereby provide better
humanitarian assistance to certain areas. However, we
believe that the text does not fully reflect the changes
on the ground. Some proposals made during the
negotiation process were not reflected in the final text,
such as regarding the transparency of the monitoring
mechanism, the management of information and control
over those non-governmental organizations involved in
humanitarian operations, including beneficiary reports,
distribution sites and all other aspects of their work.
That is why today Bolivia abstained in the voting.
