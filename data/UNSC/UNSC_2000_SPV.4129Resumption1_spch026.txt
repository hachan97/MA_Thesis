The President: I thank the representative of Brazil for
his extremely kind words addressed to our delegation.
Brazil was an inspiration to Canada on the Security Council
and I thank the Ambassador of Brazil for his participation
here today.

The next speaker is the representative of Spain. I
invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make
his statement.
