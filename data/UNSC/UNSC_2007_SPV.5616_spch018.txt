Mr. Kumalo (South Africa): I, too, wish to
welcome Mr. Solana. It is always good to hear him
brief on African issues, in which he is deeply involved.
We also appreciate the briefings we received from Mr.
Guehenno and Mr. Gambari on their support of the
process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Everything that has happened so far in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo is due to the
Congolese people. We wish to pay tribute to the
Congolese people for having achieved what they have
achieved so far. We look forward to the Government of
the Democratic Republic of the Congo taking shape,
because we would also like to take our lead from that
Government about the way forward. We hope that the
support of the European Union will continue in the
Congo, because the Congo still has a difficult road
ahead. As has been mentioned here, there are still
critical elections ahead of us. We as South Africa
pledge ourselves to continue to assist the people of the
Congo as much as we can on the road ahead.

Finally, I would like to recall what Mr. Guehenno
said in his briefing about our being careful not to move
towards early disengagement from the Congo, because
14
experience has shown that the results of early
disengagement are sometimes not positive at all.
