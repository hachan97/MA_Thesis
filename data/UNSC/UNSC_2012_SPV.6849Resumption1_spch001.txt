The President (spoke in Spanish): Under rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite
the representative of Timor-Leste to participate in this
meeting.

I wish to remind all speakers to limit their
statements to no more than four minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Liechtenstein.
