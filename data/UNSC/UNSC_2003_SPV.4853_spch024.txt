Mr. Motomura (Japan): Thank you,
Mr. President, for convening this open Security
Council meeting concerning the situation in Kosovo. I
thank Mr. Harri Holkeri, Special Representative of the
Secretary-General, for his comprehensive briefing.

First, Japan welcomes the direct dialogue that
began among the representatives of the Government of
the Republic of Serbia and of the United Nations
Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK)
and the authority in Kosovo on 14 October in Vienna.
We believe that the dialogue is the outcome of sincere
efforts by the parties concerned and is an important
step towards resolution of the Kosovo issue. We
strongly hope that confidence between the parties will
be built through continued dialogue, leading to a
concrete agreement on the various issues Kosovo is
facing. We also express our deep respect and thanks to
Mr. Holkeri for his strenuous efforts to initiate the
dialogue.

The Japanese Government considers that the
Kosovo issue should be resolved based on resolution
1244 (1999) and the standards before status policy, and
urges all the parties concerned to adopt a cautious and
restrained attitude. Regarding the standards before
status policy as the only tangible method for resolving
the Kosovo issue, my Government has in the past
provided humanitarian and reconstruction assistance,
amounting to approximately $187 million, in a variety
of areas, including refugee returns, housing and
electricity.

We are carefully watching developments in
relation to Kosovo, including this direct dialogue, and,
in cooperation with the international community, intend
to maintain our commitment to achieving the stability
and prosperity of the South-Eastern European region,
in the recognition that the stabilization of the situation
in Kosovo is essential for that goal.
