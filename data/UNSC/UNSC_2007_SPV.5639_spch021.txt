Mr. Qazi: I would first of all like to thank the
members of the Security Council for their generous
statements about the work that the United Nations
Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI) is trying to
perform in Iraq, and for their statements of continued
support for UNAMI and for the invaluable suggestions
that they have made which we have taken careful note
of.

I would also like to personally add a word of
deep appreciation for the presence of His Excellency
the Vice-President of Iraq, who has provided an extra
dimension of added value to the proceedings of today's
meetings. I would also like to reiterate the fact that the
Secretary-General attaches the highest priority to
contributing, through UNAMI and through the United
Nations country team for Iraq and other agencies and
funds, to the restoration of peace, stability and
normalcy in Iraq.

In this regard, the commitment of the Secretary-
General is made evident by his decision to convene an
International Compact meeting tomorrow, which will
also be attended by His Excellency the Vice-President,
and which will provide a framework for the launch of
the Compact process and the implementation of a
grand partnership between Iraq and the international
community in order to assist the Government and
people of Iraq in implementing their reform
programmes and reconciliation programmes, and in
order to realize a nationally-shared national vision of
the future of Iraq.

I think that is a process in which the entire world
has a stake. Recent developments, including the
meetings of 10 March and future meetings at the
ministerial level among neighbours and expanded
versions of these meetings, testify to the recognition of
the stake we all have in the success of the efforts of the
Government of Iraq. UNAMI is privileged to stand
ready to assist the Government and people of Iraq in
every respect. With these words, I thank you very
much, Mr. President.
