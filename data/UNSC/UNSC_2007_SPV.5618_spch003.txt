Ms. Wolcott Sanders (United States of America): First, the United States would like to
commend Ambassador Burian for his superb leadership
in setting up and chairing the Committee established
pursuant to resolution 1718 (2006). Ambassador Burian
provided steady guidance to members in the
Committee's first weeks and conducted his duties with
great professionalism and respect for the interests of all
Committee members throughout his tenure. My
delegation recognizes the tireless efforts he dedicated
to the Committee's successful functioning, and we
greatly appreciate his commitment.

The United States is concerned that several
important issues on the Committee's agenda remain
unresolved. Several delegations, including my own,
have proposed amendments to the lists of items,
materials, equipment, goods and technology prohibited
from export to or import from North Korea. For the
sake of the credibility of the Committee and the
sanctions regime, we wish to see those amendments
adopted as quickly as possible. The United States
stands ready to work constructively with our fellow
Committee members to reach agreement on the
outstanding proposals.

My delegation also believes that the Committee's
guidelines should be completed as soon as possible -
no later than the end of January. Guidelines could be a
useful tool for the decision-making of the Committee,
but their adoption is not a precondition for Committee
or Council action. The United States supports informal
meetings to reach consensus on the main pending
issues related to the Committee guidelines.

Finally, the United States intends to propose
several entities to the 1718 Committee in the very near
future and hopes that the submission will be considered
expeditiously for designation, pursuant to sub-
paragraph 8 (d) of resolution 1718 (2006).
