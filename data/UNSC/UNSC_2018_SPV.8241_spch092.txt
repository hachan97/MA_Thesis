The President (spoke in Spanish): I remind Council
members to limit their statements to a maximum of four
minutes. If delegations have longer statements, they are
kindly requested to deliver an abridged version in the
Chamber and make the full written statement available
to the Council.

I now give the floor to the representative of Qatar.
