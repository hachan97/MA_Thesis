The President: I thank the representative of
Sweden for distributing the text of the Swedish
statement on behalf of the European Union and for
confining himself, in this format, to oral comments. I
find that a very useful approach in our interactive
mode, and recommend it to other non-members of the
Council when they wish to represent their views in
Council debates in this style.

I see that the Under-Secretary-General has some
final brief comments on the latest statements, and I call
on him now.
