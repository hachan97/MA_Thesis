Mr. Rendon Barnica (Honduras) (interpretation from Spanish): Since the United Nations Preventive Deployment
Force (UNPREDEP) was deployed in the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, we have seen in that country the
growth of confidence and political stability, the
consolidation of pluralistic democracy and considerable
progress in the improvement of its relations with
neighbouring countries.

It is encouraging that last April an Agreement was
signed between the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which
will make it possible to normalize relations and mutual
cooperation between the two countries and to hasten the
border demarcation process.

We are also pleased with the important progress
made towards improving the country's relations with
Greece on the basis of the Interim Accord of 13
September 1995.

However, although threats to the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia are currently not as grave as they
were in 1992, we believe that the peace and security of
the country cannot be totally guaranteed until stability is
brought to the region as a whole, the Agreement for
Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina is fully implemented,
the border with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is
demarcated, and the controversy with Greece is resolved
and inter-ethnic tensions cease.

It is therefore necessary to maintain UNPREDEP
with its present military and civilian composition. The
delegation of Honduras believes that UNPREDEP
continues to play an important role as facilitator in the
dialogue between the different sectors in the country in
order to promote internal peace and stability. Furthermore,
its presence along the northern and western borders of the
country has a stabilizing effect throughout the Balkan
region.

My delegation believes UNPREDEP is a successful
operation and that it is necessary to preserve its
achievements. Therefore, we shall vote in favour of the
draft resolution extending its mandate.
