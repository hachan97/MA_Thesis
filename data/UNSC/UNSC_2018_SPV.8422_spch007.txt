Ms. Wronecka (Poland): Let me take this
opportunity to thank France for its efforts in coordinating
the drafting of resolution 2448 (2018). Poland voted in
favour of it, and we regret that we were unable to reach
consensus on it. In our opinion, the United Nations
Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in
the Central African Republic is a crucial element in the
Council's efforts to support peace in the Central African
Republic, and the issue of extending the mandate of the
Mission for another year is extremely important both
for the country and the whole Central African region.
In that context, it is critical to maintain a constructive
position in the Council on the issue in order to help to
ensure overall stability in the Central African Republic,
especially in the context of the elections planned for
2020 and 2021. It is especially important right now to
send a clear message to the Government and the people
of the Central African Republic that the Security
Council is united in supporting their aspirations for
stability and prosperity.
