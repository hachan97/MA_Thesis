Mrs. Adeng (South Sudan): We would like to
congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of
the presidency of the Security Council for the month
of April. Our delegation is delighted and ready to work
and cooperate with you during your tenure.

On behalf of the Government of the Republic
of South Sudan, today we welcome the renewal of
the mandate of the United Nations Interim Security
Force for Abyei, and we are grateful to all who made
it possible. We would like to recognize the tireless
efforts of the Government of the Federal Democratic
Republic of Ethiopia, the United Nations and the
African Union High-level Implementation Panel, as
well as the Government of the Sudan, for the positive
collaboration demonstrated in realizing the need for
supporting the United Nations Interim Security Force
for Abyei in the work of the Joint Border Verification
and Monitoring Mechanism.

Progress has been made in the Area, and the
commitment to continue the implementation of the
mandate is evident. We would like to reiterate that we,
the Government of the Republic of South Sudan and the
Government of the Republic of the Sudan, supported
by the regional communities, worked continuously
towards achieving the current positive regional
developments, so as to reassure the communities in the
Abyei Area that a satisfactory solution would be found
soon. In addition, the Joint Border Commission and the
Joint Demarcation Committee are scheduled to hold
a series of meetings in April, June and July. Today's
renewal should add to what has been achieved thus far
through the steps established by the Joint Political and
Security Mechanism.

In conclusion, the Government of the Republic
of South Sudan is committed to working closely
with the Security Council as we continue with the
implementation of the tasks at hand.

The meeting rose at 10.20 a.m.
