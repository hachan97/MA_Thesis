The President (spoke in Chinese): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of C6te d'Ivoire, in which he
requests to be invited to participate in the consideration
of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity
with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of
the Council, to invite that representative to participate
in the consideration of the item, without the right to
vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, MnDje'dje'

The President (spoke in Chinese): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Choi Young-Jin,
Special Representative of the Secretary-General and
head of the United Nations Operation in Cote d'Ivoire.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Choi to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

I wish to draw the attention of the members of the
Council to document S/2010/15, which contains the
twenty-third progress report of the Secretary-General
on the United Nations Operation in Cote d'Ivoire.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Choi Young-Jin, to whom I give the
floor.
