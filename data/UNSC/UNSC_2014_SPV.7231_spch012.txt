Mr. Hmoud (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): At the
outset, I should like express our thanks and appreciation
to you, Mr. President, for your efficient stewardship of
the Council's affairs in July, which has witnessed grave
developments in the international arena with respect to
various issues falling within the scope of the Council's
work, especially the tragic developments in the Middle
East, notably in Syria, Gaza and Iraq.

The Council has continued to follow the
developments in Ukraine, in addition to issues related
to the important and diverse African files. I would be
remiss not to commend the convening of the debate on
peacekeeping operations (see S/PV.7228). In that respect,
my delegation will not delve into the details of the
aforementioned important thematic issues, concerning
which my delegation has expressed its position in detail
during the Council's debates. It has also engaged with
all Council members in a constructive, positive manner
to explain positions and to reach a consensus with a
view to shouldering the responsibilities on the Council
in that respect.

Our intervention will focus only on the procedural
matters alluded to by our delegation in the meeting
held in March. We have reiterated those issues and our
three proposals on procedural matters in subsequent
meetings in order to improve the work of the Council
through its Informal Working Group on Documentation
and Other Procedural Questions.

In conclusion, my delegation wishes every success
to the United Kingdom during its presidency next
month.
