Dr. Piot: Yes, actually, this is one of our major
functions and roles. Such a clearing house exists on a
regional basis and in countries. The theme groups on
HIV/AIDS started doing that within the United Nations
system four years ago. Now they are reaching out; bilateral
donors, other actors, are joining these groups, and one of
the first functions is information exchange. That is also
happening at the continental level; and it is something that
is available partly through web sites as well as through
other means.

What I think will be needed is to push that through,
because, first of all, not every body has included HIV in its
development portfolio; and secondly, we also have to do a
better job when it comes to the private sector and non-
governmental organizations - what they are actually taking
on. The basis for that certainly exists and has to be
improved. I think this debate will greatly help that.
