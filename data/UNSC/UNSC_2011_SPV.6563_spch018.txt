Mr. Osorio (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I
would just like to say a very few words to thank all the
representatives who made statements for their kind
words and for the support that they have given to the
Committee in the work it is doing. I should also like to
mention the importance of the work being done by the
members of the Committee, with the support of the
Secretariat and the invaluable support of the Panel of
Experts.

It is clear that there have been violations and
attempted Violations. The Committee has thoroughly
studied each of the notifications in the report of the
members of the Panel. I will do everything in my
power under my good offices as Chair to ensure that
the report presented is distributed as soon as possible
and that, in that way, the principle of transparency with
regard to the work of such an important Committee on
an issue as serious as this can be made public.
