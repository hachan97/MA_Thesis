Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Today the Russian delegation voted in favour
of resolution 2373 (2017), which extends the mandate
of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL), because of the important stabilizing role
that this peacekeeping mission plays in the region. The
positive effect of the work of UNIFIL's peacekeepers
is felt not only on the Blue Line between Lebanon and
Israel but also within Lebanon and indeed in the Middle
East in general. We greatly appreciate the Tripartite
Mechanism's efforts to prevent and resolve incidents.
The fragile stability of the constructive collaboration
that exists among all the Lebanese political forces
must be protected. In our View, every issue on the
national agenda, including those related to security,
should be resolved by legal institutions through a
comprehensive intra-Lebanese dialogue and without
external interference.

We cherish our bilateral relations with Lebanon
and urge everyone to focus on supporting the Lebanese
people and the Government. It is also important to
help them to implement measures aimed at preserving
political and economic stability, in a country that has
recently been making forward progress. We should
ensure that we maintain a policy of support to Lebanon's
sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity. We hope
that the future activities of this important peacekeeping
operation will be carried out with full respect for the
opinion of the Government of Lebanon.
