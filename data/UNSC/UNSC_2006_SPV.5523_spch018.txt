The President: I shall now make a statement in
my capacity as representative of Greece.

I, too, would like to thank Mr. Qazi, the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General, for his
comprehensive briefing on the latest developments in
Iraq and for presenting the Secretary-General's latest
report on the activities of the United Nations
Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI). I should like
also to thank Ambassador John Bolton for having
provided us with an update on the activities of the
Multinational Force in Iraq.

The Secretary-General's report and Ambassador
Qazi's briefing are a stark reminder that a great deal
remains to be done in Iraq. Indeed, we see that the
significant achievements of the political transition
process have not yet been translated into an improved
security and human rights situation. The levels of
violence in Iraq and their devastating toll on the
civilian population is cause for alarm.

The Government of Iraq, with the help of the
international community and with the constructive
support of its neighbours, should do all it can to
address the needs of the Iraqi people, in terms of both
living conditions and also, and more importantly, of
safeguarding their security and fundamental human
rights.

We fully support the tremendous work that is
being done by Ambassador Qazi and by the United
Nations in Iraq and are aware of the very difficult
circumstances within which they are operating. We
agree with many of the observations contained in the
Secretary-General's report and concur with the
recommendations contained therein regarding the role
of the United Nations in Iraq.

Greece will continue to support Iraq's efforts,
both bilaterally and through the European Union, and
will work towards the establishment of a peaceful,
stable, democratic, pluralist and unified Iraq in which
there is full respect for human rights and the rule of
law.
I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

I call on the representative of Iraq.
