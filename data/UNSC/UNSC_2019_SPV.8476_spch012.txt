Mr. Lindner (Germany): Let me explain why we
voted in favour of the draft resolution of the United
States of America (S/2019/186) and against the Russian
draft resolution (S/2019/l90).

We supported the United States text because it
recognizes the dire humanitarian situation - a man-
made humanitarian situation - respects the sovereignty
of Venezuela, conforms with the European Union's
call for free, credible and transparent elections and
promotes a peaceful political solution to the crisis.

As for the text of the Russian Federation, it
does not present a solution to the crisis. It supports
a Government - the Maduro regime - that
does not represent the Venezuelan population and
refuses to recognize the humanitarian emergency
of its population. The text also includes unspecific
allegations of violations of the Charter of the United
Nations. However, efforts here in the Council and by the
international community do not constitute interference
in the internal affairs of a sovereign country. Serious
humanitarian rights violations by the Maduro regime,
plus the 3.5 million refugees fleeing from Venezuela
to Colombia, Brazil and even Peru and other countries,
have also made the situation in Venezuela a threat to
the stability and security of the entire region.

We want to recall our main aims for Venezuela.
We condemn the use of force. Secondly, the origins
of the ongoing crisis in Venezuela are political, and
the solution can therefore only be a political one.
An inclusive, political and peaceful solution to the
crisis must therefore urgently be found. Thirdly, we
stress the need to respond to the humanitarian needs
of the Venezuelan people - there is a humanitarian
crisis - and alleviate the suffering of the most
vulnerable. Fourthly, we strongly renew our call for
a peaceful restoration of democracy through free,
transparent and credible presidential elections, in
accordance with international democratic standards
and the Venezuelan constitutional order.
