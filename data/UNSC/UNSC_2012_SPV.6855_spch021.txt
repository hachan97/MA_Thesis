Ms. Bensouda: I thank you, Mr. President, for
this second opportunity. I would also like to take the
opportunity to thank members of the Council for their
support in this process.

There was a specific question raised by the
representative of South Africa regarding the process
that is currently ongoing at the International Criminal
Court, namely, the challenge of admissibility by Libya.
I can only say here that the judges will decide that. I
believe that many members have already commented on
the matter. Of course, it is not my place to prejudge the
judges' decision.

However, I can say that my Office finds it positive
that the Government of Libya is engaging in the judicial
process. I think that that is very positive. As a policy,
my Office has always encouraged and supported
national proceedings. The test set by the Court is clear.
The Court requires evidence of a sufficient degree of
specificity and probative value to demonstrate that
Libya is indeed investigating the case. I believe that
Libya is aware of its obligations. The burden of proof of
course remains with the Government of Libya.

The process in which we are engaged is ongoing.
I believe that the dialogue between the Court and the
Government of Libya will also be ongoing.
