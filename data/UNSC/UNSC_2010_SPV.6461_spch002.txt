Mr. Rugunda (Uganda): Uganda voted for
resolution 1964 (2010) and welcomes its adoption by
2

the Security Council. We welcome the Council's
positive response to the African Union's request to
increase the strength of the African Union Mission in
Somalia (AMISOM), which will enhance its capacity
to carry out its mandate. We encourage the Transitional
Federal Government (TFG) in Somalia to remain
cohesive and continue its efforts to reach out to those
groups that are willing and ready to cooperate in a
spirit of reconciliation within the framework of the
Djibouti Agreement.

Ultimately, the primary responsibility for
restoring peace and stability in Somalia lies with the
Government and people of Somalia. It is essential that
the international community continue to support the
TFG in building the capacity of its institutions,
especially the security sector. It is also crucial to
ensure that AMISOM. receives the requisite resources
to fulfil its mandate effectively. The African Union is
committed to supporting the Transitional Federal
Government and the people of Somalia in their efforts
to restore peace and stability in their country.
