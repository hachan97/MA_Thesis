The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.

In a letter dated 23 September 2011 addressed to
the Secretary-General, the application of Palestine for
admission to membership in the United Nations was
submitted by its President. That letter has been
circulated as an attachment to a note by the Secretary-
General, contained in document 8/2011/592.
Under the provisions of rule 59 of the provisional
rules of procedure of the Security Council, unless the
Council decides otherwise, an application for
membership shall be referred by the President of the
Council to the Committee on the Admission of New
Members. Accordingly, unless I hear a proposal to the
contrary, I shall refer the application of Palestine to the
Committee on the Admission of New Members for
examination and report.

As I hear no objection, it is so decided.

I would propose that the Committee on the
Admission of New Members meet on Friday,
30 September 2011 at 10 a.m. in Conference Room 1 in
the North Lawn Building to consider the application of
Palestine for membership in the United Nations.

The meeting rose at 9.40 am.
