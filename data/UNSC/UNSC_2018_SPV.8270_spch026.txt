Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I will be very brief. As I said today, the
Ukrainian Foreign Minister has already hinted at the
version that it will put out about the murder of the
unfortunate journalist Arkady Babchenko. I believe
that Ukraine's justice system, whose value we are
familiar with, will no doubt discover a trail leading to
Russia, as we promised the Council today.

Secondly, I mentioned Crimea, or rather the
Minister mentioned Crimea just now. I am touched by
his concern for Crimea and the suffering of the people
there. I have a piece of advice for him. He should not
worry about them; they are quite happy. And today we
are discussing Ukraine, not Crimea. Crimea is part
of Russia. It is time to accept that fact and proceed
accordingly.

I want to say that I grieve for all who have died in
this senseless conflict, including Darya Kazemirova,
whose picture we just saw. I grieve for the soldiers of
the Ukrainian army who have died as cannon fodder in
this senseless conflict. And I grieve for all Ukrainians
who have perished there, including those who have
sadly died in Donbas, victims of Ukrainian weapons.
There are many people who have suffered a fate similar
to Darya Kazemirova's, as the Minister well knows.
He should not forget to bring their pictures for the
next meeting.

The meeting rose at 6pm.
