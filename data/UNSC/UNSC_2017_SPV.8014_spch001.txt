Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them document
S/2017/636, which contains the text ofa draft resolution
submitted by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland.

to document S/2017/586, which contains the report of

in Cyprus.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.

consent of the members of the Council, the presidency
has drawn the conclusion that the Council can proceed
to take a decision on the draft resolution before it.
