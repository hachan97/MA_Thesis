The President: I would request the Ambassador of
South Africa to please convey to President Mbeki the fact
that Vice-President Gore referred specifically to him and
quoted him.

In order to shorten the rest of the day, I request all
representatives to refrain from any further compliments to
the new President of the Security Council or for the
holding of this meeting. I appreciate them greatly, and so
does my country, but the time is short, and we still have
a very large number of speakers to hear.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Japan. I invite him to take a seat at the
Council table and to make his statement.
