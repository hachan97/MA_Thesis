Mr. Oh Joon (Republic of Korea): The Republic of
Korea welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution
2165 (2014). We greatly appreciate the hard work of the
authors of resolution 2165 (2014) - Australia, Jordan
and Luxembourg - during the past several weeks.
The resolution that we have adopted today is crafted in
an operationally focused manner so as to address the
current ineffectiveness of humanitarian access into and
within Syria. The Republic of Korea co-sponsored and
voted in favour of the resolution in the expectation of
the full and immediate implementation ofthe measures
provided for therein.
More than four months have passed since the
Council adopted resolution 2139 (2014), which remains
far from having been implemented.

Syria continues to be devastated by the never-
ending violence, and civilians, including women and
children, continue to bear the brunt of the war.

Under the circumstances, it is critical for the
Council to see to it that this new resolution actually
makes a difference in the humanitarian situation on the
ground. We urge all parties in Syria, particularly the
Syrian Government, to fully comply with the provisions
of resolution 2165 (2014) and the Council's presidential
statement of2 October 2013 (S/PRST/2013/15).

For its part, the Security Council should live up
to its promise that it will take further measures in the
event of non-compliance by any party.
