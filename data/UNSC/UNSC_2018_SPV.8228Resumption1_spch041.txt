Mr. Van Oosterom (Netherlands): We abstained in
the voting on the draft resolution (S/2018/322) because
we had serious hesitations about the text, as it differed
in some crucial aspects from the Swedish text put
forward yesterday.

First of all, the text makes it insufficiently clear
that the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons Fact-finding Mission in the Syrian Arab
Republic already has the mandate for on-site visits, as
States have to comply with it. They do not need the
Council's authorization. Secondly, the text is unduly
restrictive. Paragraph 3 is not a correct reflection of
the decision of the Director-General or of his existing
mandate. The necessity of on-site investigations is up
to the team to decide. My third point is that the fact-
finding mission should be able to perform its mandate
in complete independence. Fourthly, we do not want
the precedent that Security Council authorization is
needed for a fact-finding mission to do its work. We
are convinced that those were issues that we could
have solved if the draft resolution had been put forward
for proper consultations. We received it this morning.
We regret that those concerns could not be taken
into account.

My lastpoint is that one colleague said that the litmus
test of this evening, and of today, was the voting on this
draft resolution. I disagree. The litmus test of today's

meeting was the veto by one permanent member on the
establishment of an effective attribution mechanism.
