Mr. Esono Mbengono (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in Spanish): We appreciate the initiative of convening
this meeting owing to the gravity of the situation on
the ground. We also thank the Special Envoy of the
Secretary-General for Syria, Mr. De Mistura, for his
informative briefing.

As we continue to seek a solution to the tragic
humanitarian situation throughout the country, it is also
important to continue pursuing political efforts. We all
believe that there is no military solution to the Syrian
issue. The international community must continue to
support and encourage the intra-Syrian negotiations
and impress upon all parties that it is only by sitting
around the negotiating table and engaging in frank,
direct and inclusive dialogue that a solution can be
reached that addresses everyone's concerns. In such a
process, we must ensure that the sovereignty and unity
of Syria are respected.

We support the United Nations in its mission as a
mediator in finding a political solution to the Syrian
issue, pursuant to resolution 2254 (2015). It is imperative
to relaunch negotiations in Geneva and all other peace
initiatives, including those in Astana and Sochi, which
must lead to the resumption of negotiations in Geneva.
The final outcome must ensure the well-being of the
Syrian people. Consolidating a political process in
Syria will be difficult without eradicating terrorism.
The international community must also demonstrate
its unfaltering unity by joining forces and following
the same criteria to combat the various terrorist
organizations operating in Syria.
