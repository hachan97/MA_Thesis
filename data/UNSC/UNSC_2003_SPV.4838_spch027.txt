The President: Before proceeding to give the
floor again to the judges and the prosecutors, I would
just like to note that a number of the questions I heard
during the course of our discussion this afternoon were
either slightly repetitive in nature or variants of the
same theme. I hope in considering your replies that you
would try to group them together and answer them in
as succinct and summary a form as you feel
comfortable with.

With those brief preliminary comments, I shall
now give the floor to Judge Meron to respond to the
comments and questions raised.
