Mrs. Van Vlierberge (Belgium) (spoke in French): Belgium voted in favour of resolution 2513 (2020), on the situation in Afghanistan, and welcomes its unanimous adoption. We commend the United States of America and all members of the Security Council for their close cooperation, which led us to this result. Today's resolution send an important and strong signal of the Security Council's commitment to all the parties in Afghanistan. We welcome the recent peace and reconciliation efforts. What we expect now is a prompt start to the intra-Afghan dialogue through negotiating teams that are diverse and inclusive, and the conclusion of a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire agreement to reduce the number of civilian casualties. The civilian toll of this conflict, including on children, is tragic. We further remind all parties that any agreement must protect the rights of women as of the entire Afghan people. Ishall conclude by reiterating Belgium's support for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and the Afghan people. At this vital juncture for Afghanistan, it is crucial that the United Nations play a strong role.
