The President (spoke in Arabic): I shall now make
a statement in my national capacity as Permanent
Representative of Egypt.

Egypt joined the international consensus and voted
in favour of the Security Council's adoption today
of resolution 2371 (2017), based on our consistent
commitment to upholding the credibility of the nuclear
non-proliferation system and of the Council and our firm
belief in the importance of ensuring that the Security
Council and all United Nations bodies and international
stakeholders can deliver on their mandates and their
responsibilities in this regard, as Egypt is doing. We
also believe that all similar threats should be treated
with the same level of seriousness as threats in the field
of the nuclear proliferation, and that every effort should
be made to achieve the universality of the the Treaty
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, without
double standards.

Egypt is aware of the threat that North Korea's
repeated violations of Security Council resolutions
poses to international and regional peace and security.
In that regard, we reiterate our desire to see all the
parties concerned commit to working to reach apeaceful
settlement to the crisis on the Korean peninsula,
exercising restraint, taking steps on both sides to
de-escalate the situation and paving the way to a return
to the negotiating table, with a view to upholding the
interests of all concerned and protecting international
peace and security. Once again, Egypt welcomes every
initiative and constructive idea that uses negotiation
and dialogue to achieve the denuclearization of the
Korean peninsula and, ultimately, either lasting peace
or reunification of the two Koreas.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

I give the floor to the representative of the Republic
of Korea.
