The President (spoke in French): In accordance with rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite the representative of the Central African Republic to participate in this meeting. In accordance with rule 39 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite the following briefers to participate in this meeting: Mr. Mankeur Ndiaye, Special Representative of the Secretary- General for the Central African Republic and Head of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic; Mr. Matias Bertino Matondo, African Union Special Representative and Head of the African Union Office in the Central African Republic; His Excellency Mr. Olof Skoog, Head of the Delegation of the European Union to the United Nations; and His Excellency Mr. Omar Hilale, Permanent Representative of Morocco to the United Nations, in his capacity as Chair of the Central African Republic configuration of the Peacebuilding Commission. Mr. Matondo is joining via video-teleconference from Khartoum. Since we have four briefers today - an unusually high number - I would ask for their cooperation in trying to keep the briefings within reasonable time limits. We will try to cover all the briefings in 30 minutes, so I would like to ask each briefer to be as concise as possible. The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. I wish to draw the attention of Council members to document S/2020/124, which contains the report of the Secretary-General on the Central African Republic. I now give the floor to Mr. Ndiaye.
