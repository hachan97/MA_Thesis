The President (Spoke in Russian): In accordance
with rule 39 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure, I invite Mr. Jean-Pierre Lacroix, Under-
Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, to
participate in this meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members to
document 8/2018/530, which contains the special report
of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission
and the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the
strategic review of the African Union-United Nations
Hybrid Operation in Darfur.

I now give the floor to Mr. Lacroix.
