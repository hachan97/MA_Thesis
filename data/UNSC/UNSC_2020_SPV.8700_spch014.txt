Mr. Syihab (Indonesia): Indonesia welcomes the adoption of resolution 2504 (2020), which extends the cross-border mechanism. Indeed, it has been a complex and lengthy process. We thank the co-penholders, Belgium, Germany and earlier Kuwait, for facilitating the discussions and for finding a compromise among Council members. My delegation has previously mentioned that civilian lives are at stake and we are responsible for addressing this urgent issue immediately. We believe that everyone around the table is equally unhappy but, as my delegation has stated on many occasions, it is not about the happiness or unhappiness of us as Council members but about saving human lives. We hope that the adoption of the resolution will help to save millions of Syrian lives. Again, it is fair to say that we are all equally unhappy but I still think that congratulations are appropriate. Saving 4 million people in the northwest and northeast is not an ideal outcome. As mentioned by the United Nations many times, we believe that the Al-Yarubiyah crossing point is still necessary for the delivery of medical supplies for more than 1.3 million people. We therefore support the request to the Secretary-General to provide a report on the feasibility of using alternative modalities for the border crossing of Al-Yarubiyah. We have full confidence that the Secretary-General will spare no effort in ensuring the most comprehensive, reliable and credible report in that regard. Indonesia understands that this mechanism was established during a specific situation and is supposedly a temporary instrument in some areas with limited access. We sincerely hope that the Syrian conflict will end so that the cross-border mechanism will no longer be needed. In the meantime, the adjustment of the mechanism needs to be conducted cautiously. Let us continue to stand together in our common goal to ease the suffering of people in need in Syria.
