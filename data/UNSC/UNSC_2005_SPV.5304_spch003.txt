Mr. Garcia Moritan (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): Argentina has participated in the consensus
in the adoption of resolution 1638 (2005) on the
understanding that any process of post-conflict
peacebuilding - in this case in Liberia - necessarily
must be conducted with respect for the law and for
justice.

Impunity sends a bad Sign for the future. It is an
element that weakens and undermines a genuine
process of national reconciliation. Peace can never
really be achieved until those who have committed the
gravest crimes against humankind are brought to
justice.

It is for this reason that we support the mandate
that this resolution gives to the United Nations Mission
in Liberia, within full respect for the sovereignty and
legal order of Liberia and in coordination with the
Government of that country, to apprehend Mr. Charles
Taylor and to facilitate his transfer to the Special Court
for Sierra Leone for prosecution in the event that he
returns to Liberia.

I wish to reaffirm our country's position of
defending the rule of law and the principles of
international law in all circumstances and without
exception.
