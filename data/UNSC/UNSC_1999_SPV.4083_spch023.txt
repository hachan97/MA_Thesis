The President: With the Council's permission, I
should like to suspend the meeting to enable me to keep my
appointment with the Secretary-General. The Permanent
Representative of the United Kingdom, Ambassador
Greenstock, will resume the meeting immediately after my
departure. I extend my apologies, but I would not want to
curtail an interesting discussion.

I also thank members of the Security Council for their
forbearance in my presiding over the Council and for their
kind remarks. I certainly found it extremely interesting, and
I feel that we are moving forward, both in terms of Africa
policy and in terms of looking at how the Security Council
might interact more informally, as we did yesterday and to
some extent will be able to do today.

The meeting was suspended at 12.12 p.m. and
resumed at 12.15 pm.
