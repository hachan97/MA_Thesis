The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Iraq in which he requests to be invited
to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Aldouri
(Iraq) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: I welcome the presence of the
Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, at this meeting. I
also welcome the presence of Mr. Hans Blix, Executive
Chairman of the United Nations Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission, and
Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the
International Atomic Energy Agency. Members of the
Council who wish to address questions to Mr. Blix and
Mr. ElBaradei are invited to do so at the luncheon to be
held following the adjournment of this meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

The purpose of this meeting is to hear a
presentation by the United States. In order for us to
work within our timetable, participants are urged to
speak for no longer than seven minutes.

I call on His Excellency Mr. Colin Powell,
Secretary of State of the United States of America.
