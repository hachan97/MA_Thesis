Mr. Matjila (South Africa): The text submitted
by the Russian Federation (S/20l9/l90) is consistent
with the South African Constitution and the values and
principles of democracy founded on the rule of law.
At the international level, the Russian text assesses
the principles of the Charter of the United Nations
and reinforces the founding principles of the United
Nations based on the sovereign equality of all its States
Members. That draft resolution speaks to the principle
of the peaceful settlement of international disputes, in
line with the provisions of Article 2. paragraph 3, and
Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations, on the
peaceful settlement of disputes.

Furthermore, the Russian draft resolution reiterates
the need to fully respect the principles of humanity,
neutrality, impartiality and independence in the
provision of international humanitarian assistance. The
Russian text is a reaffirmation of the principles of the
Charter of the United Nations, which enjoys universality
in terms of its scope and application. It was on that
basis that South African supported the draft resolution.

Ultimately, South Africa will urge for any further
action by the Council to be guided by genuine efforts to
maintain international peace and security and promote
the unity of peoples in that regard.
