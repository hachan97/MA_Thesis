Mr. Alemu (Ethiopia): We welcome the adoption
of resolution 2410 (2018) renewing the mandate of the
United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti
(MINUJUSTH). It is unfortunate that the resolution
could not be adopted by consensus, no doubt for good
reason. We had hopedthat some ofthe concerns expressed
on the draft text, including the issues with regard to
invoking Chapter VII, could have been addressed. We
believe that has implications for future discussions, and
that is why we conveyed our concerns to the penholder,
together with other like-minded countries.

Of course, it would have been much better if we
had been able to send a strong and unified message
in support of Haiti. Nonetheless, we all agree that
the establishment of the Mission was indeed very
important to consolidating peace by strengthening the
institutions of justice and the rule of law, as well as
supporting the institutional and operational capacity of
the Haitian National Police. The renewal of its mandate
will enable it to continue assisting the Government in
strengthening rule of law institutions. We appreciate
the initiatives and efforts being undertaken by the
Mission to build the capacities of the Haitian Police
in strategic and operational planning, criminal
intelligence, investigations, organized crime, crime
scene management, recruitment, training, gender
mainstreaming, crowd control, information technology,
communications, logistics and infrastructure
maintenance. However, we note the challenges being
faced in the area of justice and correction and the
efforts being made by MINUJUSTH to address them,
as highlighted in the report of the Secretary-General
(S/2018/241).

We understand that Haiti still continues to face
enormous challenges and vulnerabilities. We hope the
new partnership established between Haiti and the
United Nations with the establishment of MINUJUSTH
will lay a solid foundation for the long-term stability
and sustainable development of Haiti.
