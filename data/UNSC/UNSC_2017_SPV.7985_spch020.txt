The President (spoke in Spanish): I wish to remind
all speakers to limit their statement to no more than
four minutes in order to enable the Council to carry
out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy
statements are kindly requested to circulate their texts
in writing and to deliver a condensed version.

I also wish to inform all concerned that, with the
consent of the members of the Security Council, I will
suspend this meeting between 1 pm. and 2 pm.

I now welcome and give the floor to the Minister
for Foreign Affairs of Montenegro.
