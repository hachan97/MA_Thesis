The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank
the representative of Argentina for his kind words
addressed to me.

The next speaker is Mr. Engin Ansay, Permanent
Observer of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
to the United Nations, to whom the Council extended an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure at the 3648th meeting. I invite him to take a
seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
