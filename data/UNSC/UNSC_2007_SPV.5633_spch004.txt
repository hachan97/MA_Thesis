Mr. Mantovani (Italy): My delegation shares the
views expressed by the representatives of France and
the United Kingdom and would like to make a few
remarks.

Italy voted in favour of the resolution to provide
full support to the current efforts of the African Union
and to authorize the urgent deployment of the African
Union Military Observer Mission in Somalia
07-24434

(AMISOM). In our view, a fully inclusive political
process - indeed, one owned and conducted by
Somalis themselves - is the key to the solution to the
Somali crisis, as the resolution in fact recognizes. Italy
believes that, in order to be successful, it is essential
for AMISOM. to be unequivocally perceived by the
Somali population as instrumental in supporting
dialogue and reconciliation.
