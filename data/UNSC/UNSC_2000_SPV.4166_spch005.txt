The President (spoke in French): I thank the
Permanent Representative of Djibouti for his extremely
complete presentation on the Conference on which
President Guelleh has taken such a fine initiative. I
thank him too for his account of the progress already
made by many representatives of Somali society
towards the reconstruction of their State.
