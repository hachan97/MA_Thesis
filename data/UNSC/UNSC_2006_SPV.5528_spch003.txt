The President: I thank Mr. Pronk for his
briefing.

As there is no list of speakers for this meeting, I
would invite Council members who wish to take the
floor to so indicate to the Secretariat.

On behalf of the members of the Council, I
extend a warm welcome to Lord Triesman,
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs of the United Kingdom.
