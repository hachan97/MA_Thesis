Mr. Rostow (United States of America):
Resolution 1540 (2004) reflects a shared conviction
that States should keep the most dangerous weapons
and materials and delivery systems out of the hands of
non-state actors and terrorists. President Bush made
this point in his address to the General Assembly in
2003 and called on us all to act. Others did so as well.
Resolution 1540 (2004) is supposed to enhance
everyone's security. That is why the United States is
committed to helping make the resolution an effective
non-proliferation tool.

While the resolution highlights the challenge of
preventing non-State actors and terrorists from
obtaining weapons of mass destruction, it also
addresses more generally the threat posed by the
proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons, their related materials and means of delivery.
Resolution 1540 (2004) also makes specific reference
to catchall or user controls to ensure that States adopt
them, in order to prevent misuse of the devices and
materials specified in the resolution.

I would like to thank Ambassador Motoc and the
Security Council Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1540 (2004) for the statement and report.
The United States commends Ambassador Motoc and
his Mission colleagues for organizing and leading the
1540 Committee, a task which has not proved to be
simple. The Committee's work is important. The
Committee should help ensure implementation of
resolution 1540 (2004). We are pleased that many
countries have submitted reports to the Committee and
welcome all the efforts to date to meet the resolution's
requirements. We encourage States that have not yet
submitted reports to do so as soon as practicable.
