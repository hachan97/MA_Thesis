The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Ambassador Oshima for his informative briefing.

On behalf of the Council, I should like to express
gratitude and appreciation to all of the members of the
Security Council mission, which was so ably led by
Ambassador Oshima, for the manner in which they
discharged their important responsibilities on behalf of
the Council.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The next meeting, to discuss the written report
of the mission, will be fixed in consultations with the
members of the Security Council.

The meeting rose at 10.35 am.
