Mr. Mantovani (Italy): First of all, I would like
to thank as our partner the Special Representative,
Ambassador Fall, for his comprehensive and detailed
briefing and for his tireless work in these years of
valuable changes for the Great Lakes region.

I wish to commend the positive developments in
the region, such as the successful and peaceful
conclusion of the electoral process in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, the efforts of Burundi in the
peacebuilding process, the achievement of stabilization
in Rwanda and the positive achievement of the Nairobi
Conference in December.

The Pact on Security, Stability and Development
in the Great Lakes Region, adopted in Nairobi, is a
fundamental starting point towards establishing lasting
peace and sustainable development. However, we
remain concerned about the human rights situation and
the important issue of the illegal exploitation of natural
resources, which affect the economic perspective and
sustainable development of the whole region. At the
same time, we would like to express our concerns
about the stalemate in the Juba peace talks and the
continuing threat that the Lord's Resistance Army
poses to the peace and stability of the whole Great
Lakes region.

Good governance and the fight against corruption
are important pillars of the follow-up to the Great
Lakes Conference. It would be interesting for us if
Ambassador Fall could elaborate further on measures
to be taken in that field by the countries involved.
