Ms. O'Brien: I have just a few concluding
remarks. I am very pleased with the great interest that
Member States have demonstrated in this debate, and
the close attention with which they have analysed the
Secretary-General's report (S/2010/394).

I would like to reiterate the importance of
Council members, when considering the various
options to further the aim of prosecution, also taking
into account the equal importance of putting in place
adequate arrangements for imprisonment. I look
forward now to the Security Council's further
consideration of the options we have identified. If the
Council wishes to move forward with any of them, my
Office, of course, stands ready to assist in any way we
can.

I wish finally to acknowledge the contributions
made to the Secretary-General's report by the United
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the United
Nations Development Programme, the International
Maritime Organization, the Department of Political
Affairs - which, of course, includes the United
Nations Political Office for Somalia - and, last, but
not least, my own team in the Office of Legal Affairs,
who have contributed great effort to this report.

I thank you, Mr. President, for providing this
opportunity to consider and discuss the report today.
