Mr. Guterres: Very briefly, I would like to thank
you again, Mr. President, for this opportunity, and to
say that when doing humanitarian work, we are on the
receiving end of the problems we've been talking about
here. We deal with their impact and with the most
vulnerable. Obviously for us, not having the ability to
interfere with the political dimensions, which are
always part of the origin of humanitarian problems, it
is very important that the international community as a
whole be able to address the gaps - in governance, in
political will and in operating - that lead to situations
such as those we have been discussing today, and to
find the best instruments and strategies for addressing
them.
