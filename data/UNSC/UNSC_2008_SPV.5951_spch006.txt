Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): Before we came
into this Chamber, members of the Council met in the
Consultations Room. We regret that it has not yet been
possible to agree on a Security Council statement on
this issue. We hope that it will be possible in the days
to come. But the absence of a statement tonight should
not be taken as a sign that the Security Council is not
engaged on this issue and is unconcerned about the
direction that events are taking. On the contrary, this is
a grave matter, and it is one that threatens stability and
security in the region.
I would like to use this opportunity to express our
serious concern at the escalation of violence in South
Ossetia, Georgia. I would like to take the opportunity
to call for the immediate cessation of hostilities and
take the opportunity also to call on the parties to
immediately resume negotiations.

We have been concerned to hear about reports of
troops and other armed personnel from outside Georgia
and South Ossetia moving into the region, and the
United Kingdom calls on all actors in the region,
whether they are State or non-State actors, not to
escalate tensions and to exercise the utmost restraint at
this time.
