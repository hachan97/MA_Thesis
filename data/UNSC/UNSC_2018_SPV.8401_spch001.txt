The President (spoke in Chinese): In accordance
with rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure, I invite the representative of the Central
African Republic to participate in this meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them
document 8/2018/1025, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by France.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document 8/2018/922, which contains the report of
the Secretary-General on the situation in the Central
African Republic.

The Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the
draft resolution before it.

I shall first give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the voting.
