The President (spoke in Arabic): To clarify, the
representative of the Syrian Arab Republic stated that,
in his experience, there had never been a case where a
Council member raised a point of order. In accordance
with rule 30 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure, it is entirely acceptable for a Council member
to raise a point of order. However, the representative
of the United Kingdom raised a point of order before I
had given her the floor, so it was not possible to fully
interpret her statement.

I now give the floor to Mr. Bakin to respond to
comments and questions raised.
