Mr. Fernandez-Arias Minuesa (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): Spain welcomes the adoption of resolution
2197 (2015). In spite of differences during the
negotiations, the main purpose of the resolution - to
renew the mandate of the United Nations Peacekeeping
Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) - has been achieved.
Any step taken towards finding a solution to this issue
will always have Spain's support.

Spain appreciates the commendable work done by
UNFICYP. I would also like to reiterate my country's
resolute support for the good offices of the Secretary-
General through his Special Adviser Espen Barth Eide
and his renewed efforts to reach an agreement to bring
an end to a problem that has lasted for much too long
and is affecting an island that is part of the European
Union.

Spain urges removing all obstacles and resuming
negotiations as soon as possible with a view to finding
a path towards a solution of this issue.
