Mr. Heusgen (Germany): I am still a bit speechless after having listened to the fairy tale of our Russian colleague. I am under the impression that, if we continue our discussions about Ukraine, one day our Russian colleague will say that Ukraine invaded Russia and not the other way around. I hope that next time our colleague mentions the implementation of the Minsk agreements, he will finally react to what actually happened after the signing of the Minsk agreements, the most important provision of which was an immediate ceasefire, which was not upheld by Russia. Instead, Russia continued the fight against the city of Debaltseve. That was at the beginning of the implementation of the Minsk agreements and made it very difficult subsequently to convince the Ukrainians to believe in those agreements and implement them. As I said before, we congratulate our Ukrainian friends on implementing the Minsk agreements. With regard to the statement of our Russian colleague, I missed a mentioning in it of the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, where Russian rockets brought down a plane, killing 298 people. We all remember the Russian rebels celebrating the successful downing of the plane. To date, there has been no compensation paid by Russia regarding the victims of that incident.
