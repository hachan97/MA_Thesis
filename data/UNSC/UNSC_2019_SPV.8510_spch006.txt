Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
Security Council just adopted resolution 2466 (2019),
which renews the mandate of the United Nations
Mission for Justice Support in Haiti (MINUJUSTH) for
the last time, until 15 October 2019. The resolution will
be conducive to MINUJUSTH continuing to discharge
its mandate, help the Haitian Government take up its
responsibilities for national security, and achieve an
orderly final exit. It is in the interest of Haiti and the
countries of the region.

China voted in favour of the resolution. At the same
time, China believes that the Security Council bears the
primary responsibility for maintaining international
peace and security. MINUJUSTH should be focused on

assisting Haiti to deal with peace and security issues
and should not be too involved in the country's domestic
human rights issues. Council members should have had
more consultations on the draft resolution to strive for
consensus and further bridge differences.

China hopes that Council members will remain
united in follow-on consultations on the special political
mission and make efforts to promote peace, stability
and development in Haiti.
