Ms. Murmokaite (Lithuania): Let me start by
congratulating the Korean delegation on its assumption
of the presidency of the Security Council for the month
of May. I wish you every success during your tenure,
Madam. I would also like to express my delegation's
appreciation and gratitude to the outgoing presidency of
Nigeria for its wise stewardship of the Council during
the month oprril. I would also like to thank Mr. Jeffrey
Feltman for his brief but troubling information.

I would like to return to a question that has been
already raised: What would a country do if a group
of people in one of its towns decided to break away
and declare themselves above the country's laws and
Constitution, arm themselves illegally and attack local
Government, administrative and justice buildings and
take hostages and practice enforced disappearances,
beatings and killings? If such groups were supported
by sponsors from abroad and propped up by massive
propaganda campaigns demonizing the people and the
Government, and if provocations were expanding into
other regions of one's country, would one sit and wait
for the country to be decimated, or would one act in the
country's interest, protecting its sovereignty, unity and
territorial integrity?

Ukraine has taken belated and highly cautious
actions against those who are determined to carve it
up and parcel it out. Like any other State represented
in this Chamber, it has the right to protect its unity,
sovereignty and territorial integrity by all means
necessary.
As far as punitive actions go, let us be frank.
There were more victims on Thursday in Aleppo after
a market bombing by barrel bombs: at least 33 people
were killed and many more were wounded. That
took place a day after a barrel bomb was dropped by
a Government aircraft on an elementary school in
another part of the city, killing at least 20 other people,
including 17 children. Russia has so far not condemned
that punitive act by the Al-Assad regime, like countless
similar acts by the regime in the course of more then
three years of ongoing war in that country.

Today in eastern Ukraine, two Ukrainian helicopters
were shot down by mobile air defence systems, killing
two military officers and injuring seven others. Another
army helicopter was also damaged. Militants used
grenade launchers and portable air defence systems.
Peaceful protesters do not use grenade launchers that
can shoot down helicopters, or perhaps planes at some
time in the future. Peaceful protesters do not take
their morning walks armed with heavy weapons and
automatic weapons. They do not kidnap and shamelessly
parade international observers. Today provocations and
instigations are being carried out in yet another city in
Ukraine, as our Australian colleague has mentioned,
and there have now been deaths in Odessa.

Had the separatists respected and carried out the
Geneva statement, had they not taken up arms against
their own State in the first place, none of that would
be happening. It would not be happening had Russia,
the only Power with real influence on the separatists,
denounced such acts of aggression and called on the
separatists to accept a peaceful path of talks with the
central Government. Instead, Russia chose to continue
to put the blame on Ukraine, the only side that is actually
taking some steps - at gunpoint - to implement the
Geneva statement.

In addition to the various initiatives that were
referred to a couple ofdays ago during the Council's open
briefing (see S/PV.7165) - an amnesty law, a limitation
of presidential powers, decentralization - Ukraine's
Prime Minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, has now
announced that the Government will submit a draft law
to the Parliament on a referendum on national unity,
territorial integrity and decentralization, to be held
on 25 May together with the presidential elections.
He again stressed that decentralization would grant,
in certain territories, additional guarantees to the
Russian-speaking population, as well as to members of
ethnic minorities.

But I guess that people in eastern and southern
Ukraine do not really know that such initiatives even
exist, because an aggressive propaganda machine has
drowned out the voice of Kyiv, with its alternative
narrative of Ukraine's demonization. They simply will
not be allowed to know that viable alternatives exist
to the path of war, because that is not in the plans of
those who cannot wait to disrupt the 25 May elections
and proceed with Ukraine's dismemberment, under
false referendums, the so-called "will of the people" or
any sham pretext still in use by pro-Russian militants
and their State sponsors. And we must very carefully
watch on 11 May, when the self-proclaimed so-called
"people's mayor" of Donetsk republic is demanding
a new referendum be held. I would not be surprised
if another request to join Russia follows after that
referendum.

My Government condemns all attempts to destroy
Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity, and firmly rejects all Russian attempts to
validate its intentions and threats to use armed forces or
to send Russian Federation peacekeepers into Ukraine's
territory.

A couple of days ago, we expressed support for the
Secretary-General's initiatives and called for stepping
up international mediation efforts. We now welcome
the fact that Under-Secretary-General Feltman will
be going to the region. We fully stand behind the
efforts to de-escalate the situation. We also think, as
the representative of Luxembourg has stated, that
the international observers who are there to provide
unbiased, objective information must be allowed to
work across all of Ukraine's territory, in order to help
us all better understand what is happening there, but
also to help in de-escalating the situation before it
becomes much worse.

The international community must mobilize to
prevent the crisis from turning into a real bloodbath. For
we have seen, time and again, how deadly, horrifying
and inhuman the results of incitement and demonizing
the other can be. We have seen it in South Sudan, in
the Central African Republic and elsewhere. In a tragic
twist of irony, in the middle of Europe two sisterly
nations, two Slavic Orthodox nations, may start killing
each other, both victims of ruthless manipulation
through propaganda, orchestrated by the Kremlin. The
Geneva statement is the only thing we have on the table
now. We should go back to it. We hae to let it work. It is
in the interests of all of us.
