Mr. Haraguchi (Japan): The killing of Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, by Israeli
forces was committed recklessly, with no consideration
of the consequences that would follow. It is an act that
cannot be justified. It has seriously harmed the Middle
East peace process. Japan condemns the killing of
Sheikh Yassin.

Since the beginning of March, it seems that the
vicious circle, in which violence begets even greater
violence, has again commenced in this region. We fear
that the killing of Sheikh Yassin may provoke serious
retaliation and result in an overall escalation of the
conflict. Therefore, the situation must be regarded as
extremely serious. We are also concerned that the
negative impact of the incident may not be contained
within the context of the Israeli-Palestine conflict, but
may spread to a broader geographical area. To prevent
this incident from further fuelling the negative chain
reaction between hatred and violence, we urge Israel to
take effective measures immediately to calm the
situation, while exercising maximum self-restraint.

For the progress of peace, there is no choice for
the two parties but to ultimately overcome their anger
and loss of trust of each other so that they may sit
together at the negotiation table. We earnestly call
upon the leaders of both Israel and Palestine to show
courageous leadership by redirecting themselves
promptly toward peace through negotiation and
resuming the implementation of the road map, in order
to realize as early as possible the vision of two States
living side by side in peace.
