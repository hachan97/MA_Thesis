Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): Perhaps
I couldjust respond to my Russian colleague as he cited
my question specifically. It was unfortunate that he left
the Chamber before I actually spoke and perhaps it was
mistranslated on the television that he was watching.
The question I asked was not why Ms. Nadiya Savchenko
had been arrested. I asked why she was still being held,
given that Russia had agreed that there would be a full
exchange of prisoners as part of the Minsk agreements.

In terms of the facts on which he thought that I was
not well-versed, perhaps I can share with colleagues
some of the facts of Nadiya Savchenko's arrest. She
was actually captured on 17 June 2014 by the Donbas
People's Militia inside eastern Ukraine. She was
then taken to Russia, where she was charged with
involvement in a mortar attack in Ukraine, which killed
two Russian State television journalists - an attack
which occurred after she had been detained. Then,
in addition, in January 2015, Russian investigators
said that they had opened a new criminal case against
Ms. Savchenko for illegally crossing the border into
Russia, which is pretty rich given that she was detained
inside eastern Ukraine and then taking forcibly into
Russia in the first place.

Those are the facts of this case. The question I
asked my Russian colleague, and I repeat it, is why is
she still being held when there was an agreement in
the Minsk agreements of 12 February that all prisoners
would be released?
