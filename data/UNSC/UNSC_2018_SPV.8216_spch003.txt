Mr. Polyanskiy (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation supported the
adoption of resolution 2409 (2018), which renews
the mandate of the United Nations Organization
Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (MONUSCO) for one year. When drafting the
resolution, we took into account the overall situation
in the country, the assessments by regional Powers and
the views of the leaders of the Democratic Republic
of the Congo. We hope that holding the elections on
23 December, as scheduled, will help to reduce tensions
in the country.
We welcome the measures that the authorities in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo have undertaken in
preparation for the December elections, including the
passing ofa new electoral law, finalization ofthe revised
electoral lists, Parliament's approval of an electoral
budget and publication of the election timetable by the
Independent National Electoral Commission. In the
light of comments that have already made today on the
subject of elections, we would like to note that one of
the core principles of resolution 2409 (2018) is respect
for the sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo. In that regard, there should be no attempts
to impose solutions to electoral issues on Kinshasa.
That also applies to discussions on the issue of using
voting machines.

During the critical pre-election period we call on
MONUSCO's leadership to keep strictly to the mandate
set forth in the resolution adopted today. We would
like to recall that pursuant to resolution 2409 (2018),
the protection of civilians during the electoral process
must be carried out with full respect for the core
principles of peacekeeping and without interfering in
Kinshasa's domestic affairs. It will be crucial to avoid
any possibility of a situation in which MONUSCO will
be supporting one of the Congolese parties, especially
especially under the pretext of combatting violence
surrounding the elections.
