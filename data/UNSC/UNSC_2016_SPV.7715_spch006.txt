Mr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): First of all, I would
like to add my voice to the expressions of sympathy
and condolences conveyed through the United States
delegation to the victims of the mass shooting in
Orlando, which took so many innocent lives.

By voting in favour of today's resolution 2292
(2016), Ukraine proceeded from the conviction that,
despite the introduction of the arms embargo on Libya
in 2011, the threats posed by the trafficking of arms and
ammunition to that country, as well as to the countries of
the region, are growing. In an atmosphere of insecurity
and political instability, armed groups operating in
Libya, including terrorist organizations like Da'esh
or Al-Qaida, still have access to the transfer of arms
delivered to Libya in violation of the arms embargo.
These arms are being used not only to destabilize
Libya, but to undermine peace and security in northern
Africa and beyond.

The coordinated international support to Libya
and the region to address the issue of the smuggling of
illegal arms is highly needed now. The trafficking of
arms not only to Libya but from Libya must be stopped.
In this context, Ukraine welcomes the 23 May decision
of the Council of the European Union to extend the
mandate of Operation Sophia by one year and to add to
its mandate the implementation of the United Nations
arms embargo on the high seas off the Libyan coast.
We also welcome the decision of the European Union to
contribute to the training of the Libyan navy and coast
guard, which we believe would strengthen counter arms
proliferation measures in the Libyan territorial waters.

Finally, my delegation wishes to reiterate its
support to the sovereignty, independence, territorial
integrity and national unity of Libya.
