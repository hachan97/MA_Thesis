Mr. Amorim (Brazil): The draft resolution before us
is a response to the recommendations made by the
Secretary-General in his letter of 15 April 1998. In that
document, the Secretary-General emphasizes the need for
Iraq to be authorized to import equipment and spare parts
that will enable it to sell the quantity of oil necessary to
cover the imports of humanitarian supplies in accordance
with Security Council resolution 1153 (1998).

We note that the present text appropriately focuses
on the arrangements required for approval of the export
of spare parts and equipment to Iraq. We hope that the
mechanism hereby devised will be applied in such a way
so as to allow the smooth implementation of the enhanced
programme, whose humanitarian goals we want to see
achieved.

Brazil will be guided by this principle in working
with other delegations in the Committee established by
resolution 661 (1990). In this respect, we want to thank

 

the sponsors for their flexibility in accepting amendments
presented by several delegations, including ours, which
made it possible for the Council to come to a consensus on
a balanced text that does not create an unnecessarily
cumbersome set of procedures.

As the Council considers this matter, it is important to
bear in mind that we are dealing with a temporary and
exceptional measure adopted with a view to addressing the
very serious humanitarian situation in Iraq.

The enhanced distribution plan comes into effect at a
moment of more stable and cooperative relations between
the United Nations and the Government of Iraq following
the Memorandum of Understanding signed by the
Secretary-General last February. The spirit of cooperation
that guided the adoption of the Memorandum of
Understanding remains an essential element for the
achievement of the goals we are proposing here.

Brazil will vote in favour of the draft resolution.
