Mr. Gemez Camacho (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish):
As a country with a legitimate interest in Venezuela,
a sister nation, Mexico is grateful for the invitation
to participate in today's Security Council meeting
pursuant to rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

Mexico reiterates its concern about the deterioration
of the situation in Venezuela and regrets the loss of life
resulting from the most recent events. We support the
Secretary-General's statements and approach - that
all of the actors involved reduce tensions, do all they
can to prevent an escalation of the conflict and reject
all violence.

We must exhaust all avenues for dialogue and
conciliation that promote respect for human rights.
Mexico takes this opportunity to demand finding
a peaceful and democratic solution to the complex
situation facing Venezuela. The Venezuelan people
must choose their own course without interference.

In keeping with a long diplomatic tradition,
Mexico trusts that there is a negotiated solution based
on dialogue among all those involved, including the
options set forth in Chapter VI of the Charter of the
United Nations. The Governments of Mexico and
Uruguay have therefore proposed a new inclusive and
credible negotiation process that fully respects the rule
of law and human rights. We reiterate our full support,
commitment and willingness to work together for the
stability, well-being and peace of the Venezuelan people.
