The President (spoke in Chinese): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of China.

China is gravely concerned by the continuing
deterioration of the situation in Libya. We support the
Security Council's adoption of appropriate and
necessary action to stabilize the situation in Libya as
soon as possible and to halt acts of violence against
civilians.

China has always emphasized that, in its relevant
actions, the Security Council should follow the United
Nations Charter and the norms governing international
law, respect the sovereignty, independence, unity and
territorial integrity of Libya and resolve the current
crisis in Libya through peaceful means.

China is always against the use of force in
international relations. In the Security Council's
consultations on resolution 1973 (2011), we and other
Council members asked specific questions. However,
regrettably, many of those questions failed to be
clarified or answered. China has serious difficulty with
parts of the resolution.

Meanwhile, China attaches great importance to
the relevant position by the 22-member Arab League
on the establishment of a no-fly zone over Libya. We
also attach great importance to the position of African
countries and the African Union.

In View of this, and considering the special
circumstances surrounding the situation in Libya,
China abstained from the voting on resolution 1973
(2011). We support the Secretary-General's Special
Envoy for Libya, as well as the continuing efforts by
the African Union and the Arab League to address the
current crisis in Libya by peaceful means.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my list.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council will remain seized of the matter.
The meeting rose at 7.20 p.m.
