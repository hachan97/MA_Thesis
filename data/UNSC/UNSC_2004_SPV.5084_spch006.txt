Mr. Baja (Philippines): As this historic
meeting in Nairobi draws to a close, I would like, on
behalf of the members of the Council, to thank you,
Mr. President, and your delegation for your vision and
leadership in bringing us here to Nairobi. The seeds of
your initiative have been planted today. Tomorrow, we
will harvest the fruits. Our meetings in Nairobi will be
one of the highlights of your presidency, in particular,
and of the work of the Security Council in general. I
would like to invite my colleagues to give you and
your delegation a big hand for a very successful two
days of meetings in Nairobi.
