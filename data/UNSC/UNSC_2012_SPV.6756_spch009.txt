Mr. Mehdiyev (Azerbaijan): Azerbaijan has been
consistent in its support of the efforts aimed at ending
the violence, overcoming the crisis in Syria and finding
a solution by peaceful means and through dialogue.
Like all Security Council members, we have also
expressed our full support for the Joint Special Envoy
of the United Nations and the League of Arab States,
Mr. Kofi Annan, and his six-point proposal. As we all
want a peaceful solution to the Syrian crisis, it should
be emphasized once again that there is no alternative to
the mission of the Joint Special Envoy. He should enjoy
the uninterrupted support of the international
community for the work that he is doing.

With the adoption of resolution 2043 (2012)
today, authorizing the deployment of the United
Nations Supervision Mission in Syria, another
milestone has been reached in addressing the Syrian
crisis through peaceful means. We believe that the
United Nations Supervision Mission will be
instrumental in monitoring the cessation of armed
violence in all its forms by all parties and in monitoring
and supporting the full implementation of the Joint
Special Envoy's six-point proposal. It is very important
that the resolution adopted today once again reaffirms
the strong commitment of the Security Council to the
sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial
integrity of Syria.

Azerbaijan voted in favour of today's resolution
with the hope that its adoption will contribute to
ongoing efforts aimed at ending violence and human
rights violations, facilitating a dialogue, overcoming
the crisis and sustaining the progress achieved on the
ground.
