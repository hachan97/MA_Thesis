Mr. Adamu (Nigeria): I also thank Ambassador
Oyarzun Marchesi for his briefing. Nigeria welcomes
the entry into force of the Joint Comprehensive Plan
of Action on 18 October, which is a major step in the
implementation of resolution 2231 (2015). In our view,
the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action provides a clear
road map for the implementation of the agreement by
Iran and the P5+1 with regard to the Iranian nuclear
programme. It is our hope that that will lead to a
resolution of all outstanding issues. We would like to
reiterate our support for the agreement and urge the
parties to implement it in a transparent manner and in
good faith.

We are encouraged by reports coming out of
Vienna today that indicate that the Board of Governors
of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has
adopted a final resolution, completing the Agency's
probe of Iran's nuclear programme. That is another
crucial step in the implementation of the Iranian nuclear
agreement. We look forward to implementation day, at
which time the Security Council sanctions imposed
on Iran will be lifted. We commend the Chair of the
Security Council Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1737 (2006) for his effective leadership and
assure him of our continued support.
