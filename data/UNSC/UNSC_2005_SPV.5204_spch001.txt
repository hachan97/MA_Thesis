The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Iraq, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. al-Istrabadi
(Iraq) took a seat at the Council table.

The President (Spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document 5/2005/373, which contains a report of the
Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 30 of
resolution 1546 (2004).

At this meeting the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Danilo Tiirk, Assistant Secretary-
General for Political Affairs. I now give the floor to
Mr. Tiirk.
