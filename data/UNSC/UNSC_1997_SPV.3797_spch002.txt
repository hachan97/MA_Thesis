Mr. Mapuranga (Zimbabwe): I wish to register the
delegation' appreciation for this opportunity to participate
in these extremely important Security Council deliberations
on the extremely grave situation now prevailing in Sierra
Leone.

On behalf of His Excellency President R.G. Mugabe,
who is the current Chairman of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU), I wish to state categorically that the OAU
fully and unreservedly supports the initiative of the
Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire,
Guinea and Ghana, member States of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Their
mission is as noble as their efforts are praiseworthy.

The OAU Assembly of Heads of State and
Government, meeting in its thirty-third session, at Harare,
from 2 to 4 June 1997, "strongly and unequivocally"
condemned the coup d'e'tat that took place in Sierra
Leone on 25 May. That coup d'e'tat, mounted and
executed on OAU Day - Africa Day - and on the eve
of the meeting of the Council of Ministers and the
summit of Heads of State and Government, was not only
a blatant affront to the continental organization but also
a brazen challenge to the will and determination of the
OAU, the will and determination not only to resolve
violent conflicts now plaguing the continent but to
safeguard and defend and nurture democracy in Africa.
The coup d'e'tat was also a challenge and an act of
defiance to the United Nations and indeed to the entire
international community.

I wish to state in conclusion that Africa stands
solidly and unreservedly behind President Kabbah and the
elected Government of Sierra Leone, unreservedly
condemns the coup d 'etat and calls upon the Security
Council in particular and the international community at
large unconditionally to support the efforts of ECOWAS
and the OAU in seeking the non-recognition and demise
of the military regime in Sierra Leone and in working for
the restoration of the democratically elected Government
in that country.
