Mr. Moustafa (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the
outset, I would like to join my colleagues in expressing
our condolences to the Government and the people of
Colombia on the hundreds of Colombian lives claimed
by the landslide.

I would like also to thank the Special Representative
of the Secretary-General for his comprehensive
briefing. I have three brief points to make.

First, my delegation commends the efforts of the
two parties to the Final Peace Agreement and the
reaffirmation of their commitment to abide by the
timelines specified by the Agreement, despite the
logistical issues that have led to relative delays. In in
that regard, we welcome the successful cantonment of
combatants in the agreed-upon zones. We believe that
the next phase should focus on efforts to reintegrate
members of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de
Colombia into Colombian society.

Secondly, we commend the efforts and positive and
effective steps taken by the Government of Colombia
in implementing the Peace Agreement, in particular
with regard to legislation aimed at prosecuting the
perpetrators of crimes committed during the conflict,
as well as the establishment of other entities, including
the Monitoring and Verification Mechanism to follow
up on the implementation of the Peace Agreement and,
in particular the special electoral mission that will
monitor ensuring participation in political life.

Thirdly, and lastly, we hope that the two parties
will overcome their differences with regard to the
implementation of the Peace Agreement. That includes
committedly respecting the agreed timelines. In
that regard, we hope that the Security Council's visit
during Uruguay's presidency in May will provide
impetus for the Peace Agreement in Colombia and
its implementation. That would reflect international
support for the Agreement.
