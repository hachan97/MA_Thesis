The President: In accordance with rule 39
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I
invite the following briefers to participate in this
meeting: Mr. Mark Lowcock, Under-Secretary-
General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency
Relief Coordinator; and Mr. David Beasley, Executive
Director of the United Nations World Food Programme.

Mr. Lowcock and Mr. Beasley are joining this
meeting via video-teleconference from Dublin and
Biel, Switzerland, respectively.

The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda.

Recalling the Security Council's latest note 507 on
its working methods (S/2017/507), I wish to encourage
all participants, both members and non-members of the
Council, to deliver their statements in five minutes or
less. Note 507 also encourages briefers to be succinct and
to focus on key issues. Briefers are further encouraged
to limit initial remarks to 15 minutes or less.

I now give the floor to Mr. Lowcock.
