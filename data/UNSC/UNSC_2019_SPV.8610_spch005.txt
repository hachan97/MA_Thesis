Mr. Schulz (Germany): We welcome today's
unanimous adoption ofresolution 2485 (2019), renewing
the mandate of the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL). We want to explicitly thank France,
as penholder, for the professional and constructive
conduct of the negotiations. The extension of UNIFIL's
mandate is proof of the Council's continuous and strong

support for the mission and its appreciation for its work.
In the current regional context, the role of UNIFIL in
preserving calm at the Blue Line and beyond cannot be
overestimated. For all of us who want to see stability
between Lebanon and Israel, investment in the mission
is worthwhile. UNIFIL remains a crucial de-escalating
element in the region that we must preserve, support
and strengthen.

In that regard, we call on Lebanon and Israel
to use the instruments of UNIFIL, in particular
the communication channel through the Tripartite
Mechanism, in order to find a way to de-escalate and
reduce current tensions. We call on all sides to exercise
restraint with regard to both action and rhetoric, respect
the provisions of UNIFIL's mandate and avoid any
action that violates resolution 1701 (2006) and threatens
the stability between Lebanon and Israel.

Finally, we want to commend the valuable work of
all peacekeepers on the ground under the leadership of
Force Commander Del Col. It remains essential that
UNIFIL be able to fully implement its mandate.
