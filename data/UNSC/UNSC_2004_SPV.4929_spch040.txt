Mr. Hachani (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): I would
like first of all to thank you, Mr. President, for your
rapid and positive response to the request for the
convening of this urgent meeting to discuss the most
recent serious events in the Middle East. I would also
like to take this opportunity to say how much we
welcome the skilful way in which you are conducting
the work of the Security Council this month.

At a time when the international community is
stepping up its efforts at all levels with a view to
reviving the peace process in Middle East and to
restoring confidence among both parties, we were
shocked that the Israeli security forces should have
perpetrated yet another crime. Its target this time was
one of the most important Palestinian leaders, Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin, leader of the Hamas movement.

Tunisia was distressed when it learned of that
assassination, and we express our condemnation of that
crime, which will further escalate the violence,
increase tension, impede the efforts for peace and
undermine the possibilities for negotiation.

Tunisia calls upon the international community,
in particular the Security Council, to assume its
responsibilities in this situation, which represents a
threat to international peace and security, to work
swiftly and resolutely to resolve the situation and to
deploy all necessary efforts to give priority to the logic
of peace. We also renew the appeal of the President of
the Republic of Tunisia made during the Arab Summit
held at Cairo in 2000 for urgent international protection
for the Palestinian people through the interposition of
international forces.
