Sir John Weston (United Kingdom): I have listened
carefully to Ambassador Lavrov and I understand his
wish at this time to air fully the Russian point of view. I
shall not comment in detail on his presentation. I can say,
however, that so far as the United Kingdom is concerned,
we are quite confident that the recent United
Nations/North Atlantic Treaty Organization action in
Bosnia has been appropriate and justified. It has had clear
and specific objectives designed to protect the safe areas
in line with Security Council resolutions. The Bosnian
Serbs have only to comply with the requirements
explained to them by the United Nations commanders in
theatre and the action will end.

But the real focus of world attention today has been
on Geneva and the progress achieved there in the political
process. It is clear that there can be no military solution
to the conflict in Bosnia. We have emphasized throughout
the crisis that all sides, including the Bosnian Serbs, must
work towards a peaceful solution. We welcome the
outcome of the meeting between the Contact Group and
the Foreign Ministers of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, of Bosnia and of Croatia in Geneva earlier
today. The principles agreed at this meeting represent an
important step forward in the search for a political
settlement. In particular, it means in effect that the
Bosnian Serb leadership has agreed to negotiate on the
basis of the Contact Group plan.

This is only one step on the path to peace. Difficult
negotiations lie ahead. All of the parties must be prepared
to make compromises if a settlement is to be achieved.
But a start has at last been made.
