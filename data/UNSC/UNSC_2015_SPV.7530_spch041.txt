Ms. Honore: I wish to express thanks to all the
members of the Security Council for their observations
on the situation in Haiti and on the work of the the United
Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) at
this critical juncture of Haiti's history, in keeping with
the Secretary-General's report (S/2015/667).

I have noted the emphasis that they have placed on
the need for continued forecasts on the key areas of the
Mission's mandate, including the rule of law and human
rights, police development and the strengthening of
State institutions and good offices, in addition to
the work of the United Nations agencies, funds and
programmes in the fields of humanitarian assistance
and development. I have also taken careful note of their
comments regarding the transition of the Mission and
planning to that end with the Government of Haiti and
the United Nations country team. My gratitude is also
extended to the other States members of the Group of
Friends, to Haiti and to the multilateral organizations
that have also proffered comments during this debate.

On behalf of the personnel of MINUSTAH-military,
police, civilians, both international and Haitian - as
well as United Nations Volunteers, I express our deep
appreciation for the Council's support for the work of
the Mission as we contribute to the important electoral
process in train, and in the interest of continued
stabilization for the benefit of the people of Haiti.
