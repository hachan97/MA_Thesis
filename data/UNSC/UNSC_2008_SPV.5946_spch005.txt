The President: Before adjourning this meeting, I
should like, on behalf of the Council, to express
sincere thanks to all the men and women who have
served the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and
Eritrea over the past seven years for their dedication
and professionalism in carrying out the mandate
entrusted to them by the Security Council.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.
