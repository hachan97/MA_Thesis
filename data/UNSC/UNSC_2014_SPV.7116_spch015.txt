Mr. Mangaral (Chad) (spoke in French): Chad
welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution
2139 (2014), on the humanitarian situation in Syria,
following lengthy negotiations in which everyone made
commendable efforts to reach a compromise. We thank
the Security Council members who took the initiative to
promote this resolution, which will certainly contribute
to relieving the suffering of the civilian population
of Syria, who have been attacked with barrel bombs,
besieged, displaced and become refugees.

Chad is very aware of the humanitarian issues
in Syria, and we hope that the implementation of the
provisions of the resolution will enable the population
to have access to the humanitarian assistance that they
are unjustly deprived of. The Syrian authorities are
called upon to put an end to violence against the civilian
population and violations of international humanitarian
law and pave the way for true negotiations in order to
reach acceptable solutions to the Syrian crisis.

We welcome the firmness shown by Council
members and their commitment to the Syrian people,
and we encourage the Council to continue efforts in
that direction.

The resolution is a call on the Syrian parties to
shoulder their responsibilities and prioritize dialogue
in order to bring an end to the abuses that innocent
civilians have fallen victim to. We believe that speeding
up the destruction of chemical weapons and ending
the use of barrel bombs would help create conditions
conducive to a return to stability in Syria.

Chad supports the efforts of the international
community in seeking a lasting solution in Syria, and
resolution 2139 (2014) is a very important step in that
direction.
