The President: In view of the lateness of the
hour, and with the concurrence of the member of the
Council, I would like to suspend the meeting until
tomorrow at 10 a.m. sharp. I would like to make an
appeal to the members to start at 10 sharp, because we
heard 27 speakers this afternoon and another 29 remain
on the list.

The meeting was suspended at 6.40 pm.
