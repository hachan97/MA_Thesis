The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received letters from the representatives of
Argentina, Canada, Haiti and Venezuela in which they
request to be invited to participate in the discussion of the
item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the discussion,
without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Lelong (Haiti)
took a seat at the Council table, Ms. Ramirez
(Argentina), Mr. Fowler (Canada) and Mr. Escovar
Salom (Venezuela) took the seats reserved for them at
the side of the Council Chamber.

The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Support
Mission in Haiti, documents S/ 1996/813 and Addendum 1.
Members of the Council also have before them document
S/ 1996/ 1002, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by Argentina, Canada, Chile, France, the United
States of America and Venezuela. I should like to draw the
attention of the members of the Council to document
S/ 1996/956, which contains the text of a letter dated
15 November 1996 from the Secretary-General addressed
to the President of the Security Council, transmitting the
text of a letter dated 13 November 1996 from the President
of Haiti addressed to the Secretary-General.

The first speaker on my list is the Permanent
Representative of Haiti, on whom I now call.
