Mr. Aboulatta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): It is an
honour for me to participate in today's historic meeting,
which crowns the work that has been done to achieve
peace in Colombia with the Council's adoption of
resolution 2307 (2016), which moves the peace process
into a new stage, on the basis of a solid foundation
and the support of the United Nations. I would like to
take this opportunity to congratulate the Colombian
Government on reaching a peace agreement with
the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia
(FARC), enabling Colombia to begin a new chapter in
its history and put an end to a conflict that has lasted
more than 50 years and created thousands of victims.

Today's resolution was adopted unanimously, proof
of the Council's desire to ensure that the Government
of Colombia has the support it needs in order to restore
peace in the country. In that regard, I would like to
point out that Egypt sponsored and voted in favour of
the resolution, because we have always supported the
Colombian Government in its efforts to achieve peace.

I therefore thank all those who contributed to
and played an effective role in achieving this historic
Agreement. I hope that the people of Columbia will be
satisfied with it, so that it can be truly implemented and
the United Nations political mission can commence its
work.

I would also like to thank the United Kingdom
delegation for its contribution in drafting the resolution
and achieving the necessary consensus.
