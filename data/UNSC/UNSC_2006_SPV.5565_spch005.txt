Ms. Loj (Denmark): Regrettably, Denmark was
not in a position to support the draft resolution
(S/2006/878) just considered. The draft resolution
addresses issues of great concern to my Government. If
it had included a more thorough recognition of the
complexities on the ground, my delegation would have
liked to vote in favour of the draft resolution.

Denmark remains very concerned about the latest
developments on the ground. We were shocked to learn
about the tragic event in Beit Hanoun that led to the
death of 19 civilians, many of them children. We
deplore the fact that the recent Israeli military
3
operations in Gaza have taken a heavy toll in civilian
lives.

We have welcomed the Israeli recognition that the
attack on Beit Hanoun on 8 November was a mistake
and have urged the Israeli authorities to complete the
announced inquiry promptly and to make the results
public. The reality is that only an end to violence can
pave the way for progress towards lasting peace.
Rocket attacks from Palestinian territory into Israel
must be condemned and must stop. At the same time,
Israel must ensure that short-term measures aimed at
improving the security situation of Israeli civilians are
carried out in accordance with international law and do
not hamper the achievement of a lasting solution to the
conflict. In this regard, we have continuously stated
that the exercise of a State's right to self-defence must
be proportionate.
