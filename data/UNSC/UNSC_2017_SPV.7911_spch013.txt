The President: Before adjourning this meeting,

as this is the last scheduled meeting of the Council for
the month of March, I would like to express the sincere
appreciation of the delegation of the United Kingdom to
the members of the Security Council, especially to my
colleagues the Permanent Representatives, their team
members and to the secretariat of the Council for all
their support. It has been a busy month, with numerous
highlights that we will summarize for the whole of the
United Nations membership and for civil society at the
informal wrap-up session this afternoon, at 3 o'clock.
We could not have done any of that alone, or without the
hard work, support and constructive contributions of all
members of the Security Council and of the secretariat,
as well as all of the relevant conference services and
the interpreters.

In addition to all of those I have thanked, I would
also like to express my personal thanks to my excellent
team for all that they have done to make this presidency
a success. As we end our presidency, I know that I
speak on behalf of the Council as a whole in wishing
the delegation of the United States all the very best in
the month of April.

The meeting rose at 1.55 pm.
