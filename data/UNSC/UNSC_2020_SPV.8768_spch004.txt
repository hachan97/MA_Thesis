Mr. De Riviere (France) (spoke in French): France welcomes the adoption of resolution 2547 (2020). The efforts undertaken by the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH) in support of political dialogue as well as for governance and the strengthening of the rule of law is of vital importance and should be continued. We welcome the renewal of its mandate for a period of one year. We welcome the fact that the resolution recalls the urgent need to engage in a nationwide dialogue that brings in all Haitian stakeholders in order to facilitate the conduct of free, fair and transparent elections. We call on the Haitian Government to redouble its efforts to undertake the necessary reforms, first, in terms of justice and the fight against impunity. At a time when the country is experiencing an uptick in violence, it is vital that the Haitian State ensure the safety and security of its citizens and that the perpetrators of violence are held accountable for their actions. Secondly, the credibility of Haitian institutions is being significantly undermined by instances of corruption. Civil society has for years been calling for transparency. The fight against corruption must to be the top priority of the political establishment in Haiti, and the Haitian authorities must provide guarantees in terms of the proper use of the international funding that is granted to them. The adoption of this resolution reflects the fact that the international community remains vigilant with respect to the situation in Haiti. This is of vital importance, and France will continue to work to that end alongside our partners.
