Mr. Van Bohemen (New Zealand): New Zealand
has made no secret of its frustration that it has been
almost eight years since the Security Council adopted
a resolution on the Middle East peace process. New
Zealand has worked hard over the past two years to try
to advance a resolution on this issue, which we consider
to be one of the most pressing unaddressed issues on
the Council's agenda.

New Zealand has floated its own ideas for a more
comprehensive draft than the one that is before us today
(S/2016/1100), and we are grateful for the willingness of
other Council members to engage with us on the text. It
became apparent to us, however, that the balance of the
Council wished to focus on the more pressing issue of
the settlements, which, as my colleague from Malaysia
has said, is threatening the viability of the two-State
solution. This message was very clearly delivered to us
in the last Quartet report and in regular reports of the
Secretary-General.

For these reasons, we supported the text circulated
on Wednesday and joined the group calling for a vote
on that text today, in order to ensure that the Council
had a chance to consider it.
