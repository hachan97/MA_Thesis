The President: There are no more names on the
list of speakers. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.

I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of
the delegation of the United Kingdom, to thank all the
members of the Council, especially my colleagues the
Permanent Representatives, their respective staff and
the secretariat of the Council, for all the support they
have given to us in the month of March. It has been a
busy month, and one in which we rallied to consensus
on several important issues on our agenda. We could
not have done it without the hard work, support and
positive contributions of every delegation and the
representatives of the Secretariat, as well as the
interpreters, meeting servicing staff and sound
engineers. As we end our presidency, I know I speak on
behalf of all Council members in wishing the United
States delegation good luck in the month of April.

The meeting rose at 10.20 a.m.
