Mr. Motoc (Romania): I will be brief, not only
because we are nearing exhaustion and the hour is late,
but also because I feel there is little to add to a vote
that speaks for itself in terms of the Council's ability to
come together and find solutions to the most intricate
matters submitted for its consideration - solutions that
are in harmony with our peoples' expectations of a
fairer, and hence safer, world at the dawn of the
twenty-first century.

Romania deems the adoption of resolution 1593
(2005) at the very end - indeed, at the last minute -
of a thoroughly successful Brazilian presidency for the
month as a stand against impunity; as an expression of
confidence in the ICC's ability effectively to handle
complex cases like that which the Council has today
referred to it; and as proof that our common resolve to
bring an end to impunity in the Sudan and Darfur has
ultimately proved stronger than the differences
members might have. At the end of the day, what the
Council said today is that there is no way, in our times,
that anyone, anywhere in the world, can get away
without just retribution for the commission of serious
crimes.

Like my Greek colleague, we also hold it
manifest that, by deciding to refer the case of reported
crimes in Darfur to the ICC, the Security Council
enhances its conflict prevention and resolution
capabilities.

There are two things I consider it important to
recall tonight. The first is the debt we owe to the
Cassese Commission for making it possible for us to
reach this point. The second is that upholding the ICC
as we have, by adopting resolution 1593 (2005), will
be to no avail unless we remain supportive of the Court
as it exercises its prerogatives upon our referral.
