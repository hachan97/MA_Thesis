Mr. Zinsou (Benin) (spoke in French): Benin
voted in favour of resolution 1645 (2005), on the
Peacebuilding Commission. We did so because we
support that body and that resolution in both spirit and
letter.

However, we deem it inappropriate for the
resolution to have been submitted under the current
agenda item title. My delegation believes that the
peacebuilding commission is designed both to prevent
conflicts and to address post-conflict issues. We
therefore feel that the title of this agenda item may
prejudice the implementation of paragraph 12 (c) of the
resolution.
