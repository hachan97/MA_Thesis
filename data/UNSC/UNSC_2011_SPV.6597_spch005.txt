Mrs. DiCarlo (United States of America): The
United States supports the peacekeepers of the African
Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur
(UNAMID), who continue to play a critical role in the
safety and security of the people of Darfur.

We are extremely concerned by the situation on
the ground in Darfur. In the light of the dangerous
situation, we are pleased that the Council has
recognized that the enabling environment necessary for
a Darfur-based political process does not yet exist. For
any process to achieve lasting peace in Darfur, the
ability of the participants to express their free will,
without fear of harm or retribution, must be
guaranteed. In Darfur, however, those who speak out
are regularly arrested, tortured or killed.

It is first and foremost the responsibility of the
Government of the Sudan to create such enabling
conditions. We strongly demand that all parties to the
conflict agree to an immediate ceasefire and engage in
direct negotiation.

UNAMID's role in bringing peace to Darfur is
critical. The Mission has no higher priority than to
protect civilians and to secure humanitarian access for
millions of vulnerable people. We are pleased that
resolution 2003 (2011) affirms that. Based on reporting
from the field, including UNAMID's reporting on
political, civil and human rights, the Security Council,
taking into account the views of the African Union,
will determine whether the enabling conditions
necessary for UNAMID to engage in further efforts
related to the Darfur-based political process have been
met.

As civilians continue to be targeted and bombs
continue to be dropped in Darfur, the United States
welcomes UNAMID's focus on protecting civilians and
ensuring that humanitarians have the access that they
need to provide lifesaving assistance. We call on the
parties to the conflict to recommit themselves to
serious and comprehensive political negotiations to
bring an end to such atrocities.
