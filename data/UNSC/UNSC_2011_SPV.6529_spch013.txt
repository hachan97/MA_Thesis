Mr. Yang Tao (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
would like to thank High Representative Inzko for his

briefing. China welcomes the progress made in Bosnia
and Herzegovina in such fields as security sector
reform, enhancing the rule of law and economic
recovery. We hope that all ethnic groups in Bosnia and
Herzegovina will proceed on the basis of the long-term
interests of the country in a spirit of mutual
understanding and compromise; effectively implement
the Dayton Peace Agreement; settle their differences
through dialogue and negotiations; and increase mutual
political trust to enhance national reconciliation. China
looks forward to the formation of a new, broad-based
Government in Bosnia and Herzegovina at an early
date so as to ensure further progress in various aspects
of national reconstruction.

China respects the independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well
as the choice of all peoples of the country on the road
to development. The future and destiny of Bosnia and
Herzegovina lie in the hands of all of its peoples,
whose right to self-determination should be duly
respected.

China supports the international community's
constructive role in resolving the question of Bosnia
and Herzegovina. At the same time, the issues there are
very complex and sensitive, involving not only Bosnia
and Herzegovina itself, but also long-term peace and
stability in the entire Balkan region. We hope that all
parties concerned will settle their issues appropriately
through dialogue and negotiations in a spirit of
reconciliation and cooperation, avoid any escalation of
tensions, and adopt effective measures to consolidate
the achievements in the country's political process.

Together with the international community, China
will continue to support and assist in efforts to achieve
sustainable peace, stability and development in Bosnia
and Herzegovina.
