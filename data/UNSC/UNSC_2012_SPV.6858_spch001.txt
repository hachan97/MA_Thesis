The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

I should like to welcome the return of the members
of the Council and the Secretariat who took part in the
Security Council mission to Timor-Leste.

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Baso
Sangqu, leader of the Security Council mission to
Timor-Leste.
