Mr. Gatilov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation voted in favour of
the draft resolution on the full lifting of sanctions
against Libya on the basis of its principled position that
restrictive measures under Chapter VII of the Charter
must immediately cease once all Security Council
requirements have been met.

We are convinced that the issue of lifting the
sanctions against Libya has long been ripe for
consideration. In the past five years Libya has turned
over two suspects in the Lockerbie matter for trial, has
provided the French judiciary bodies with all the
necessary information to complete the trials related to
the Union de transports aeriens (UTA) flight and has
signed a range of international and regional agreements
to counter terrorism. It has also demonstrated
repeatedly its commitment to combating this threat to
international peace and security. As such, Libya has
fully met its commitments under Security Council
resolutions 731 (1992) and 748 (1992), creating the
necessary prerequisites to fully close this issue.

Despite the suspension of action related to
sanction measures by the Council in 1998, the political
image of this country has been undermined because we
were delayed in resolving the question of lifting the
sanctions. We believe it important that the Security
Council has been able to take decisions to close the
chapter on this complex issue.
