Mr. Adechi (Benin) (spoke in French):
Resolution 1546 (2004), which we have just adopted
unanimously, paves the way for the effective
restoration of Iraqi sovereignty, as called for in the
timetable for the political process. We welcome the
positive developments in the negotiations that led to
the adoption of the resolution, which establishes a
normative framework for the end of the occupation, the
restoration of the full sovereignty of Iraq and the
conditions in which the multinational force will
undertake its work in that country. We commend the
open-mindedness shown by the sponsors of the
resolution throughout the negotiations.

We believe that it is now up to the new
Government of Iraq to assume its responsibilities by
ensuring that the established machinery works
adequately. We call on it to strive to win the trust of all
Iraqis so as to involve as many of them as possible in
the political process and thereby ensure that the
elections of January 2005 enjoy all the necessary
credibility. We also emphasize the importance of the
methodical organization of the national conference,
which must be held in a spirit of national
reconciliation. In that respect, it can make an important
contribution to ensuring the inclusiveness of the
political process.

Finally, we urgently appeal to the international
community to provide all the necessary assistance to
the people of Iraq in order to help them meet the
challenges they are facing. The neighbouring countries
should also fully shoulder their responsibilities in the
context of the joint efforts necessary to stabilizing the
situation on the ground. It is in their interests that the
situation in Iraq be normalized as soon as possible.
