Mr. Harrison (United Kingdom): Mr. President,
may I, through you, join others in thanking
Mr. Lubbers for his excellent and comprehensive
briefing. It is very useful for the Security Council to be
given such a good overview of his work in the areas in
which we are engaged.

I should like just to ask two questions, through
you, Mr. President, to Mr. Lubbers. The first concerns
Afghanistan, and the second is a more generic
question.

In Mr. Lubbers' presentation, he drew attention to
the proposal by Mr. Brahimi that the mandate of the
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) should
be extended more generally throughout Afghanistan. I
should like to ask him if he could give us some
indication of how that might, in his opinion, influence
refugee flows within and from Afghanistan, and in
particular how much the insecurity that currently
prevails in the rural areas of Afghanistan represents a
constraint on the return of refugees. That is my first
question.

My second, more generic question relates to the
recent restructuring of the Office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which
other speakers have referred to. I would like to ask
Mr. Lubbers how great an effect that has had on his
responses to recent crises, including the one in
Afghanistan.
