Despite the challenges posed by the coronavirus disease pandemic, the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) has performed its mandates actively, making important contributions to the political settlement of the issue of Western Sahara and the maintenance of regional stability. China supports the extension of the mandate of MINURSO and its continued constructive role in the political process to solve the Western Sahara issue. We hope that the Security Council will have more thorough consultations on draft resolutions on mandate renewal for MINURSO in the future to make the text more balanced, achieve consensus through consultation and send a positive signal. I believe this will be conducive to the political process for Western Sahara. In addition, the personal envoy of the Secretary-General should be appointed as soon as possible to facilitate the resumption of the Geneva round table process and create favourable conditions for advancing the political settlement. China will continue to uphold an objective and just position and encourage the two parties to seek a just, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution through dialogue and negotiation on the basis of relevant Security Council resolutions.
