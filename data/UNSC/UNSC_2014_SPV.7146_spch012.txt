Mr. Omaish (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): My
delegation welcomes the efforts of the Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1737 (2006) in
assisting States and international organizations with
issues related to the implementation of the resolutions
imposing sanctions on Iran by providing guidance and
answers to States' technical questions on the timeliness
and accuracy of the implementation of the resolutions.
We encourage the Committee to continue conducting
the necessary investigations of violations and to assess
opportunities for ongoing engagement with the Iranian
Government with a view to clarifying pending questions
regarding violations cited in the report, especially with
respect to the prohibited missiles launched during the
Great Prophet VII military exercises, and to the arms
shipment that was seized on 23 January 2013 aboard a
vessel en route to Yemen.

We appreciate the Committee's efforts to consult
with other sanctions committees in issuing guidance
to States on the implementation of targeted financial
sanctions.

Finally, we welcome the conclusion of the Geneva
agreement on the joint action plan between Iran and
the P5+l. However, at the same time, we urge the
Committee to carry on its mandated tasks to the fullest
possible extent.
