The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them document
S/1998/353, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by Costa Rica, France, the Gambia, Kenya,
Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of
America.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to document S/1997/812, which contains the
text of a letter dated 15 October 1997 from the Secretary-
General addressed to the President of the Security Council,
transmitting the letter dated 1 August 1997 from the
President of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda
addressed to the Secretary-General.
