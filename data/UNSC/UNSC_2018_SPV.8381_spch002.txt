Mr. Ma Zhaoxu (China) (spoke in Chinese):
On 18 October, the Plurinational State of Bolivia,
China, the Russian Federation and Equatorial Guinea
sent a letter to the President of the Security Council
(S/2018/938) expressing their opposition to holding this
Council meeting to hear a briefing by the Chairperson
of the independent international fact-finding mission
on Myanmar established by the Human Rights Council.

The Charter of the United Nations clearly defines
the responsibilities of the principal United Nations
organs and the division of labour between them. The
primary responsibility of the Security Council is the
maintenance of international peace and security. It
should not get involved in country-specific human rights
issues. The fact-finding mission on Myanmar is a special
mechanism of the Human Rights Council and does not
have a mandate to brief the Security Council. Nor is
there a precedent for the Security Council to receive
a briefing from a country-specific special mechanism
of the Human Rights Council. By receiving a briefing
from the Fact-Finding Mission, the Security Council
will encroach on the mandates of the General Assembly
and the Human Rights Council, violate provisions of
the Charter and weaken the responsibilities and roles of
various United Nations bodies, thereby leading to grave
negative consequences.When it comes to the issue of
Rakhine state, the Security Council should play a
constructive role, and any action it takes should help to
resolve the issue. Pushing for a briefing by the Human
Rights Council's fact-finding mission in the Security
Council will disrupt and undermine the ongoing
dialogue process. It does not help to resolve the issue
of Rakhine state but will rather further complicate it,
running counter to the process of finding a settlement.
That is why we are opposed to having this meeting and
hearing this briefing.
