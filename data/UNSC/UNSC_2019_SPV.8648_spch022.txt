The President: I would like to remind all speakers
to limit their statements to no more than four minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements
are kindly requested to circulate their text in writing
and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in
the Chamber.

1 now give the floor to the representative of Turkey.
