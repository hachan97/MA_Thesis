Mr. Aboulatta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): My
delegation voted in favour of resolution 2302 (2016),
extending the mandate of the United Mission in South
Sudan, which was due to expire at the end of this
month. Given the Mission's critical role, I take this
opportunity to thank its personnel for their actions to
protect civilians, sometimes at risk of their own lives.

The rapid response to the request made by the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)
reflects the resolve of African countries to end the
conflict in South Sudan and the suffering of its people
as soon as possible. The proposals put forward are far-
reaching and we hope that they will be implemented.
The proposals can best be implemented by keeping
the divergences of positions and the principles of
peacekeeping in mind.

Following the adoption of the resolution today, we
now have 12 days to achieve consensus on renewing
the Mission mandate. We should have liked to be given
more time to consider our options for implementing the
proposals before us. We need to keep the suffering of
the people of South Sudan closer to heart and prevent
the violence from spiralling out of control. Peace in
South Sudan will prevail only if the African Union and
the Security Council join forces to settle the conflict.
Trust between the factions must also be rebuilt and the
root causes of the conflict analysed. Any other solution
would be a short-term placebo.

We hope that next week's Igad Summit will identify
as soon as possible a solution to the situation that takes
the various positions into account so that the suffering
of the South Sudanese people can come to an end.
