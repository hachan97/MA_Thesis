With the noteworthy political progress that has been made in Iraq, it is important that the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) continues to operate and discharge its mandate. We encourage sustained cooperation between UNAMI and the Government of Iraq, both of which have a shared ambition to promote the positive advancement of Iraq. To that end, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines welcomes the adoption of the draft resolution contained in document S/2020/449 for renewing UNAMI's mandate. We recognize the unanimous adoption of the resolution as evidence of the Security Council's commitment to the security and prosperity of Iraq and the Iraqi people. Despite the progress that has been made, we must not forget the many persistent challenges that necessitate the continuance of UNAMI's support to the Iraqi authorities in their efforts towards inclusive dialogue, reconciliation and reconstruction. In this regard, we reiterate that UNAMI must continue to respect Iraq's sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence. We also reiterate our support to Ms. Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert and her team and recognize their continued dedication to the people of Iraq in line with their mandate.
