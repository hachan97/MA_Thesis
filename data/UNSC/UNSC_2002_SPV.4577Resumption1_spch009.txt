The President: I thank Mr. Mar Dieye in
particular for the thoughts he has given on the way
forward. I was struck by the comments that he made
about what is needed in each country. I would ask him
to tell me if, in his view, he thinks that the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) actually has
the right kind of machinery in place for the
coordination and integration of institutional
development programmes at a subregional level? He
focused very much on what needs to be done in each of
the countries within the Mano River Union, but on a
subregional basis, does the capacity exist?
