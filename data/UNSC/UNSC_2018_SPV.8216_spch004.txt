Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (Spoke in Chinese): In
recent years, the Government of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo has been actively advancing the
peace process and enhancing capacity-building in the
area of security and governance, and China commends
those efforts. Meanwhile, the country is still facing
multiple challenges on the political, security and
humanitarian fronts and needs the ongoing support and
assistance of the international community.

The United Nations Organization Stabilization
Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(MONUSCO) has played an important role in
maintaining peace and stability there, and the
international community should continue to support it
in implementing its mandate. Against that backdrop,
China voted in favour of the Council's adoption today
of resolution 2409 (2018), which extends MONUSCO's
mandate.

China has always maintained that in providing
assistance to the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
the international community should ensure that its
Government takes the lead in resolving its own issues
and that its sovereignty, independence and territorial
integrity is fully respected, helping it to strengthen its
own security so that it can achieve peace and stability
on its own.

China has always supported a peace process in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo and has taken an
active part in peacekeeping operations there. We have
also provided humanitarian assistance, such as medicine
and food, and we have actively participated in its
reconstruction and economic and social development.
China stands ready to work with the international
community to continue to play a constructive role in
achieving peace, stability and development in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.
