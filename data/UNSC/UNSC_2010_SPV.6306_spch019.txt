Baroness Ashton: All that remains for me to do
is to thank you, Sir, for presiding over this meeting and
the members of the Security Council for their positive
comments and recognition of the role of the European
Union. I might also say that I recognize that the Lisbon
Treaty provides us with a real opportunity to develop a
more coherent and effective strategy for Europe.
Listening to all the comments that were made, I think
that the agenda is well set for the future of the
post-Lisbon Treaty world and especially for myself. We
very much look forward to continuing the strong
partnership with the United Nations into the future.
