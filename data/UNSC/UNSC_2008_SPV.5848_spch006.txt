Mr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): As a
responsible party to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons (NPT), Viet Nam attaches great
importance to all three major pillars of the NPT: non-
proliferation of nuclear weapons; respect for the rights
of all parties to development, research, production and
use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes; and the
pursuit by every party of negotiations on measures
relating to ending the nuclear arms race and to nuclear
disarmament. We hold that the parties' full
implementation of their obligations under the NPT and
their full enjoyment of the benefits that the Treaty
brings will contribute effectively to the maintenance of
international peace and security and to the social and
economic development of States parties to the Treaty.

Keeping in mind the importance it attaches to
those three major pillars of the NPT, Viet Nam has
followed the Iran nuclear issue closely and with great
interest in seeing it resolved by peaceful means and
through dialogue. Viet Nam has always welcomed and
supported the efforts of the United Nations and the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), as well
as those of concerned countries or groups of countries
to that end. At international forums including the
United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement and the
IAEA and in its bilateral dealings with other countries,
Viet Nam has consistently affirmed the aforementioned
position and has contributed to the promotion of
international dialogue and cooperation aimed at
settling the outstanding issues in this connection.

Viet Nam actively participated in the process of
negotiating the text of the draft resolution contained in
document S/2008/ 141 and, on the basis of its initial
elements, proposed changes to the following effect:

that Iran's cooperation with the IAEA and the progress
in the implementation of the IAEA-Iran work plan be
more positively recognized; that the authority and role
of the IAEA as the body mandated to resolve the non-
proliferation issues within the framework of the NPT
be more adequately reflected; that the right of States to
carry out normal international trade activities be
respected; and that implementation by States of
provisions of the draft resolution must be in
accordance with their national legislation and
consistent with international law, in particular the law
of the sea and relevant international civil aviation
agreements.

With the incorporation of such changes that we
and other Council members proposed, and given the
following facts - the fact that both the draft resolution
and the statement to be issued by the Foreign Ministers
of China, France, Germany, Russia, the United
Kingdom and the United States advocate a diplomatic
and negotiated solution to the Iran nuclear issue; the
fact that the 22 February 2008 report of the Director
General of the IAEA, while recognizing progress in
Iran's cooperation with the IAEA, indicates that Iran
still needs to respond to requests by the Security
Council and the IAEA; the fact that the scope of
implementation envisaged in this draft resolution is
basically the same as that in the previous resolutions,
namely resolutions 1737 (2006) and 1747 (2007),
adopted by consensus by the Council - Viet Nam will
vote in favour of the draft resolution contained in
document S/2008/141.

Having decided to vote in favour of the draft
resolution, we are strongly convinced that favourable
conditions must be created for the peaceful resolution
of the Iran nuclear issue, including cessation of hostile
policies against Iran, assurance of Iran's legitimate
security interests and respect for the right of Iran to use
nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. We also believe
that the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free-zone in
the Middle East, in accordance with relevant
resolutions of the General Assembly, and the adherence
by all States in the region to the NPT would be positive
steps in this direction.

Finally, while hailing the new progress in
cooperation between Iran and the IAEA, we are
desirous to see Iran's efforts positively matched in the
coming period.
