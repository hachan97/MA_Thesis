China listened to the briefing by Prosecutor Bensouda very attentively. We welcome the Ambassador of the Sudan participating in this meeting. The political process in the Sudan has made positive progress. The situation in Darfur has significantly improved, and the Sudan's peace process has made important steps forward. China welcomes these developments. Last week, the Security Council adopted resolutions 2524 (2020) and 2525 (2020). China supports the establishment of the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan, requested by that country, and the withdrawal of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur as soon as possible. China believes that the Sudan is able to handle its own affairs and safeguard its national sovereignty, security and stability. China calls on the international community to work together and provide more constructive assistance for the Sudan to achieve stability and development, while respecting the country's sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity. China's position on the issue of the International Criminal Court (ICC) remains unchanged. China holds the view that the ICC should strictly observe the principle of complementarity, fully respect the legal sovereignty of the State and avoid interfering in its internal affairs. On issues related to the Sudan, the ICC should attach importance to the legitimate appeals of the Sudanese Government and the African Union regarding the ICC's engagement on Darfur and respect the views of the Sudanese Government. China is ready to work with the international community to play a constructive role in achieving peace, stability and development in the Sudan.
