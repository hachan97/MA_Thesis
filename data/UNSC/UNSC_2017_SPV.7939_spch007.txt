Mr. Aboulatta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): My
delegation would like to thank the delegation of the
United States for its constructive efforts to ensure
the adoption of resolution 2352 (2017), unanimously
extending the mandate of the United Nations Interim
Security Force for Abyei. The resolution to extend the
mandate unanimously reflects the unity of the Council
and sends a clear and strong message to the parties to
the conflict that the Council has a clear vision that it
wants to implement and that the two parties should
comply with that vision.

My country voted in favour of the resolution in
order to ensure a correlation between the strength of
the Force on the ground and its mandate. This approach
should be followed when reviewing any peacekeeping
operation, instead of seeking a gradual decrease in
strength that would affect the ability of the operation to
carry out its mandate.

In closing, we note the need to take into consideration
the concerns of all troop-contributing countries (TCCs)
when determining, extending or altering the mandates
of current peacekeeping operations. TCCs are an
important part of these operations and responsible for
implementing the mandates of operations. They are the
parties most capable of determining the needs of every
peacekeeping operation and of their own forces.
