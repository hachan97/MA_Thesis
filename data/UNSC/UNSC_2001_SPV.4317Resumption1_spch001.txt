The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Zimbabwe in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation ofthe President, Mr. Jokohya
(Zimbabwe) took the seat reservedfor him at the
side ofthe Council Chamber.

The President: Before continuing with the list of
speakers, I thought I would indicate that if any of the
visiting Ministers wishes to take the floor again to
comment on what has been said during the Council
discussion after Council members have spoken, we
would wish to give him that opportunity, and I would
ask his delegation to inform the Secretariat so that I
would know to give him the floor when the Council
members have finished speaking.
