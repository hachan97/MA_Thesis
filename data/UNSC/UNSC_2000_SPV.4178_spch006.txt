The President: Ambassador Fowler will shortly
be leaving New York to take up another diplomatic
assignment. I wish, on behalf of the Council, to thank
him for the dynamic approach he brought to the
position of Chairman of the Committee dealing with
sanctions against UNITA. That sanctions against
UNITA are finally bearing fruit is largely due to the
efforts of Ambassador Fowler and his Committee,
which clearly demonstrated the linkage between the
illegal exploitation of diamonds and the ability of
UNITA to fund its activities. We wish Ambassador
Fowler well in his future endeavours.
