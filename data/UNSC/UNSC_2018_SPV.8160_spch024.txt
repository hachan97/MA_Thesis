Mr. Field (United Kingdom): I simply would like
to restate the facts of which everyone in the Security
Council is well aware: Russia was - and we accept this
fact 4 a key player in creating the Joint Investigative
Mechanism (JIM). We were very delighted to see
that it played its full role in that regard. The Security
Council will recall that Russia voted to establish the
JIM. (resolution 2235 (2015)). It voted in favour of a
report and resolutions that set out the very detailed
methodology that the JIM. was to follow.

This was an independent expert body. It then made
a key undisputed finding of fact: the fact that the Syrian
regime - the regime of Al-Assad - had gassed its
own people. These were the facts that Russia then did
not like and so it was on that basis that it chose to veto
the JIM, and in so doing, it set back the whole issue of
non-proliferation and all of our efforts and destroyed a
global consensus against the use of chemical weapons.
This is very dangerous precedent, as I said in my
original comments. It was also, I think, a sad day for us
all here in the Security Council, but most importantly it
was a calamity for the Syrian people.

I would therefore simply urge Russia to use the
very considerable influence that it wields to stop
Al-Assad from using chemical weapons in future and
to comply with his country's obligations. We recognize
that Russia is playing an important part in the Iranian
issue, so it is not that Russia is being obstructive across
the board, but in relation to the Syrian matter, as I said,
with an expert independent body that came up with
a report that Russia did not like, it sought to veto it,
which sends an extremely dangerous signal for future
nuclear proliferators and one that I think we should all

roundly condemn.

The meeting rose at 1 pm.
