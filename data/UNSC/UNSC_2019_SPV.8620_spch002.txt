Mr. Heusgen (Germany): We appreciate the fact
that the Council is ready to vote on draft resolution
S/2019/749. We have been discussing the text with
delegations. A revision has been proposed at the last
minute by Afghanistan and is extremely important to
Afghanistan. I am sorry to bring it up now at such a late
stage, but it was submitted at the last minute.

I turn to sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph 5 of the
draft resolution, where it says, "provide outreach as well
as good offices to support the Afghan-led and Afghan-
owned peace process", the Government of Afghanistan
insists on adding "if requested by and in close
consultation with the Government of Afghanistan".

As I said, I apologize for the late text revision. I
think the words "Afghan-led" convey that idea clearly,
but the Afghan Government has asked us to submit the
revision. We are here to help the Afghan people and
the Afghan peace process. We are here to support that
country, which is in a difficult situation. The revision
just came up now and we feel responsible to our
Afghan friends. I therefore propose the aforementioned
revision. Of course, we have discussed this with our
co-penholder and with the Chinese delegation, with
which we were discussing and negotiating until late last
night. Finally, I note that the proposed change is agreed
language from previous resolutions.
