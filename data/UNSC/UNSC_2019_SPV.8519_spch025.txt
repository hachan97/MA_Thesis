The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as the representative of Germany.

I would like to turn again to the representative ofthe
Sudan and ask him if he could respond to the question
that was put to him by several delegations around the
table with regard to the issue of visas, in particular for
police personnel.
I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

I give the floor to the representative of the Sudan.
