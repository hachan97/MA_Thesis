The President (spoke in French): I thank
Mr. Costa for his briefing.

I wish to remind all speakers to limit their
statements to no more than five minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to circulate the texts in writing and to deliver
a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.
I invite Her Excellency Ms. Susan Rice, member
of the cabinet of the President of the United States of
America and Permanent Representative of the United
States, to take the floor.
