The President: We still have a very long list of
speakers, and I wish to remind all speakers to limit their
statements to no more than four minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
Delegations with lengthy statements are again kindly
requested to circulate the text in writing and to deliver
a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.

I now give the floor to the representative of Brazil.
