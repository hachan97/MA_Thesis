The President: I shall now make a statement in
my national capacity.

I thank the High Representative for his very clear
report (see S/2010/575, annex) and express the United
Kingdom's strong support for his ongoing work in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. I also thank His Excellency
Mr. Radmanovie for attending this meeting so soon
after his swearing-in for a second term on the
Presidency, and congratulate him on his re-election.

The United Kingdom shares Mr. Inzko's concerns
about the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Over
the past six months, there has been a worrying lack of
progress on key reforms and an escalation of divisive
anti-Dayton rhetoric and actions against Bosnia and
Herzegovina's State-level institutions. In that context,
it is important to obtain the means to deal with the
challenges to Dayton.

We want to see transition from the Office of the
High Representative to the European Union Special
Representative, but only on the basis of the full
completion of the 5+2 conditionality. The level of
rhetoric highlighted in the report is of particular
concern. It is important that the Security Council make
very clear its unequivocal commitment to Bosnia and
Herzegovina's territorial integrity, as enshrined in the
Dayton Agreement.

We fully agree with the High Representative's
call for the continuing mandate of the European Union
Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina (EUFOR). In the
context of the continued political tensions, EUFOR
fulfils an essential role underpinning stability in Bosnia
and Herzegovina. We welcome the fact that the
October elections were conducted, as the Office for
Democratic Institutions and Human Rights has said,
generally in line with international standards. The
newly elected leaders now need quickly to form new
Governments at the federal and State levels, with the
reform agenda at the heart of their programmes.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Croatia.
