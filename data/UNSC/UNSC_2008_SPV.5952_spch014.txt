Mr. Natalegawa (Indonesia): Since the Council
last convened, in the early hours of this morning,
developments in South Ossetia, Georgia, have not
turned for the better. On the contrary, as we feared, the
international community is witnessing a further
escalation of violence and a serious deterioration of the
security situation. The attendant humanitarian
consequences, as we also anticipated, are unfortunately
becoming evident.

We very much regret that the Council missed an
opportunity to pronounce itself clearly and with a

single voice on this unfolding grave situation earlier
this morning. We must not miss that opportunity again.
It is essential that we express our deep concern at the
escalation of violence in South Ossetia, Georgia. It is
vital that the Council call on all the parties to cease
hostilities, de-escalate tensions and demonstrate a
preference to resolve the dispute through dialogue and
negotiations rather than through the use of arms. The
stakes are clearly enormous: peace and stability in the
region and, not least, the safety and well-being of
vulnerable civilians.

We call on all conflicting parties to exert extra
efforts to protect civilians and spare them from the
harm of armed violence and, thus, avert the outbreak of
a humanitarian crisis. In short, it is incumbent upon the
Council to mobilize its positive and collective power of
persuasion and to encourage all the parties to exercise
restraint and resume negotiations. That ought to come
sooner rather than later.
