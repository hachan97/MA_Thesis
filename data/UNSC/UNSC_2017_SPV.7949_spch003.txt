Ms. Schoulgin Nyoni (Sweden): We welcome the
adoption this morning of resolution 2354 (2017), on
countering terrorist narratives. We especially welcome
the fact that the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the
Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate
will be involved in compiling good practices from
Member States and other actors for the benefit of
the wider membership. More research is also needed
to know what strategies actually yield results in
countering terrorist narratives. We encourage public-
private partnership in the development of strategies and
approaches, as Governments are not always the best
originators of such messages.

We take this opportunity to underline that any
measure aimed at combatting terrorism must be
undertaken in full respect for international law,
including international human rights law, international
humanitarian law and international refugee law. This
is, of course, also applicable in terms of the prevention
of terrorism, including in relation to countering
terrorist narratives. Freedom of information, freedom
of expression - online and offline - and freedom of
association are essential to fostering critical thinking
and societies resilient to terrorist propaganda.
