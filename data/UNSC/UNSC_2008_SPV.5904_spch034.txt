Judge Byron: I would simply like to thank
speakers for their thoughtful statements. I would like to
assure them that I have taken full note of the comments
and the advice that has been given and will ensure that
that wise counsel is considered as we proceed. These
statements have demonstrated the continuing
commitment of the Security Council to the high ideals
of international criminal justice and the eradication of
impunity.

I would also like to say that I am extremely
grateful for the indications of general appreciation for
our work. I would like to assure the learned
representative of the United Kingdom that, when I
report back to the staff of the Tribunal, it is most likely
that there will be a positive impact on staff morale. I
can only reiterate that the judges and staff of the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda will
remain fully committed to doing our best to complete
our mandate within a reasonable time.

I have also noted the concerns and comments on
the issue of referrals. What I would simply say in that
regard is that the Tribunal will continue its work in
capacity-building. In that regard, I would remind
members of the Council that capacity-building
activities do not form part of our assessed budget and
that any assistance that is given to strengthen the
voluntary trust fund will be applied in that area.
