The President (spoke in Chinese): I shall now make
a statement in my capacity as the representative of
China.

On the whole, the situation in Darfur, the
Sudan, is now easing. There has been progress in the
implementation of the Doha Document for Peace in
Darfur. The international community should continue to
support the parties in Darfur in fully implementing the
Doha Document and in ensuring that the rebels there
renounce violence and sign a peace agreement with the
Sudanese Government on the basis of the Document.

China believes that the political process holds the
key to an appropriate settlement of the question of
Darfur. It is only through the realization of a lasting
peace in Darfur by political means that the foundation
can be truly laid forjustice.

Our position on the question of the International
Criminal Court remains unchanged. We hope that the
efforts of the ICC on the issue of Darfur will facilitate
the political settlement of the question of Darfur. We
hope that the Security Council and the ICC will fully
respect the views of the African Union and the Arab
League on this question.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

I now give the floor to Mr. Luis Moreno-Ocampo
to respond to the comments made and questions raised.
