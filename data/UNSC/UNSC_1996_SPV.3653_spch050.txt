The President (interpretation from Spanish): There
are no further speakers.

I do not wish to end this debate without drawing a
brief conclusion from it this evening.

The conclusion I think I can reach as President of
the Council following this debate is that all who have
spoken want the fighting, violence and bloodshed to cease
once and for all and believe that the humanitarian needs
of the civilian population must be met and that the peace
process must continue to be supported.

The Council will remain seized of the matter.

The meeting rose at 9.50 pm.
