Ms. Ziade (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): Allow
me to quote from the statement made by the
representative of Lebanon at the Security Council
meeting of 27 April:

"What takes place in Lebanon affects Syria, and
what takes place in Syria affects Lebanon.
History has demonstrated that fact most
convincingly Today, more than ever, the hearts
and minds of all Lebanese people stand in support
of Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity, its
people and the safety and security of its
children We regret the deaths of the victims.
We extend our condolences to their families and
hope that Syria will enjoy peace and progress."
(S/PV.6524, p. 9)

As Lebanon believes that presidential statement
S/PRST/2011/l6 adopted today does not help to
11-44260
address the current situation in Syria, Lebanon
disassociates itself from the statement.
