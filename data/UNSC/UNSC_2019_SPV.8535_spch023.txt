Mr. Heusgen (Germany): I am speaking on behalf
of the penholders, including Belgium and Kuwait.
My statement is warranted given the Deputy Foreign
Minister of Russia asked about what message should
come out of our meeting. I would like to respond to
that. I regret that he left the Chamber, but I understand
that he left while the Syrian Ambassador was speaking.
The point I wanted to make is the following.

I repeat what our British colleague just said, and
the message that we expect to come out of our meeting
is that everybody around the table supports and
subscribes to respect for international humanitarian
law. While fighting terrorism, there is no excuse for
violating international humanitarian law by using
chemical weapons, barrel bombs or indiscriminately
bombing populations, thereby wreaking havoc upon so
many civilians, as we have unfortunately witnessed not
only in Idlib but also during the fighting in Syria.
