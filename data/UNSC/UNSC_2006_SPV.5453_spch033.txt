Mr. Jallow: I thank all members of the Council
for their contributions, which have demonstrated their
support for the International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda (ICTR) and for the Tribunals generally. We are
also greatly encouraged by the understanding
expressed during the course of the debate of the central
role of the referral of cases within the completion
strategy and, in turn, of the need for capacity-building
to ensure the success of the referral system.

In my experience, the countries that are willing to
take on our cases are likely unable to assume the costs
associated with the referral of cases. Therefore, it is
very important that some way of assisting them be
found. At this stage, we need to move from a general
encouragement of support for those countries that are
willing to examining and establishing concrete
measures for the building of judicial capacity in those
countries. In that respect, I was pleased to hear the
representative of the United Republic of Tanzania
propose that the United Nations Secretariat, in
consultation with the Tribunals, look at what measures
can be put in place. I think that that would be very,
very welcome and that it would help the referral
system.

Of course, let me assure representatives, in
response to the concerns that they have raised, that
referrals are made only on the condition that the
application of the death penalty is excluded, and that
there are guarantees of fair trial - both in law and in
practice - in the country concerned. If there are no
such guarantees, I do not envisage that the Tribunals
would make any referrals to that country. In that
respect, it was also encouraging to hear from the
representative of Rwanda that his country would
shortly be taking the steps necessary for it to be
eligible. That would help us immensely, as I mentioned
in my introduction of the matter.

I should like once again very much to thank you,
Madam, and the rest of the Council.
