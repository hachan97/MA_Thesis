Mrs. DiCarlo (United States of America): The
United Nations Disengagement Observer Force
(UNDOF) has played a critical role in maintaining the
ceasefire between Israel and Syria since 1974, and we
welcome today's vote. The calm in UNDOF's area of
operations was seriously disrupted just weeks ago. The
United States is deeply concerned about the grave
events of 15 May and 5 June in the Golan Heights. We
are further troubled by credible reports that the Syrian
Government played a role in those demonstrations,
which resulted in fatalities and injuries. These actions
are a transparent ploy by the Syrian Government to
incite violence along the disengagement line in order to
divert public attention from its own indiscriminate
killings and abuses of the human rights of the Syrian
people.

These events display clearly the regime's
hypocrisy. It uses the Palestinian cause to encourage
violence and risk its long-standing ceasefire with
Israel, while continuing to brutally repress the Syrian
people and deny their call for reform and democratic
change. The Syrian people have shown their courage in
demanding a transition to democracy. The Syrian
Government must stop shooting demonstrators and
allow peaceful protests. It must release political
prisoners and stop unjust arrests and torture. It must
allow human rights monitors access and start a serious
dialogue in order to advance a democratic transition.

In operational terms, we are concerned about the
increased restrictions on UNDOF's movement in the
area of separation. Both parties must respect the terms
of the 1974 disengagement of forces agreement,
including by preventing breaches of the area of
separation.

Finally, the United States commends the men and
women of UNDOF for their dedication, and thanks
Major-General Ecarma for his leadership.
