Mr. Dabbashi (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in Arabic): Allow me at the outset to congratulate you,
Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the
Council for this month; I wish you every success. I
would like to commend the delegation of the United
Kingdom for the excellent manner in which they
conducted the Council's work last month.

I would like to place on record that my delegation
voted in favour of the resolution that we have just
adopted on the understanding that the resolution relates
to piracy in the waters under Somalia's sovereignty and
is in response to a request by the Government of
Somalia. The resolution does not include any provision
that would touch on the sovereignty of other countries
or run counter to the principles of international law or
the law of the sea.
