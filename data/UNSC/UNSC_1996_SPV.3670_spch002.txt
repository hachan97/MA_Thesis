Mr. Maleski (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia): Since my delegation is participating for the
first time in the deliberations of the Security Council
under your presidency, Sir, allow me to congratulate you
on your election.

The Government of the Republic of Macedonia
deeply appreciates the presence of the United Nations
Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP), the first
successful preventive peace-keeping operation of the
United Nations. My Government is of the opinion that the
situation in the region has not changed to the extent that
the mandate of the mission should be restructured or
terminated. The Dayton Agreement has not been
implemented; the period of its full implementation is still
ahead of us. The threats to the Republic of Macedonia by
the potential explosion of the crisis have not been
overcome yet, in View of the issue of Kosovo in our
immediate neighbourhood. The northern border of the
Republic of Macedonia has still not been mutually
demarcated. The Republic of Macedonia has been left
with a significantly reduced defensive capability as a
consequence of the withdrawal of all armaments and
military equipment following the departure of the former
Yugoslav army and as a consequence of the Security
Council resolution imposing an arms embargo.

I have listed some of the reasons why the mandate
of UNPREDEP should be further extended. I would like
to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the
members of the Security Council and to the troop-
contributing countries that, together with the Government
of the Republic of Macedonia, have preserved peace and
stability in a volatile region. By strongly supporting the
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
Republic of Macedonia, the United Nations has
successfully demonstrated its preventive capability in our
common efforts towards world peace.
