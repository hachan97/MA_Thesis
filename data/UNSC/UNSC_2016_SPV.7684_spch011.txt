Mr. Aboulatta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Egypt
voted in favour of resolution 2285 (2016), extending
the mandate of the United Nations Mission for the
Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) for a full
year, convinced as we are of the importance of the
role played by United Nations peacekeeping forces in
maintaining international peace and security, and our
role as a troop-contributor.

The region is facing several challenges that threaten
its people and threaten the existence of the States in
the region. Those are circumstances that should not be
further aggravated. In that context, since last March,
Egypt has called for a calm and balanced approach.
That is the only way that the Council will be able to deal
with this matter. That position was reflected during the
negotiations on resolution 2285 (2016), adopted today.
The contents of the resolution are drafted well and in
a very careful and precise manner in order to convey
the situation in Western Sahara, and with a view to
settling the crisis there in accordance with the relevant
Council resolutions.

After having adopted this very important resolution,
which draws on lessons from past experience, and after
having prevented what could have become a large-scale
crisis, we must examine in a thorough and in-depth
manner the events that were set in motion on 7 March,
in addition to the events that followed and their causes.
We must learn lessons from the past in order to maintain
international peace and security. Furthermore, the
main lesson of the events of the past two months is
the danger of an explosion of conflicts that have been
left unresolved. We must reiterate the importance of
reaching, within the framework of Security Council
resolutions, a political settlement agreed to by all with
regard to Western Sahara.
