Mr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): My
delegation welcomes the Security Council's adoption
of a resolution on the situation in the Palestinian
territory, a resolution that unambiguously condemns
the killing that openly occurred in Rafah, where dozens
of unarmed civilians, including many children, have
fallen victim to the bullets and the missiles of the
Israeli army, which has been caught red-handed in its
barbaric acts before the cameras of the entire world.
We also welcome the fact that the Security Council has
expressed its grave concern at the large-scale
demolition of homes, which is in flagrant violation of
international law and the Fourth Geneva Convention,
and that the Council has called upon Israel to cease
such practices.

My delegation is particularly pleased that the
Security Council, united today in its rejection of
Israel's scandalous conduct, has decided finally to send
Israel a strong signal, long-awaited by the international
community, that it cannot continue with impunity to
flout the Council's authority and to trample underfoot
the norms of international law. The international
community now expects Israel to abide by its will, to
put an immediate end to its policy of aggression,
destruction and provocation of the Palestinian people
and to commit itself in good faith to abide by its
commitments, as laid out in the road map. In particular,
as requested at the Quartet meeting of 4 May, it must
take certain steps:

(spoke in English)

"the Government of Israel should take no actions
undermining trust, including deportations; attacks
on civilians; confiscation and/or demolition of
Palestinian homes and property, as a punitive
measure or to facilitate Israeli construction;
destruction of Palestinian institutions and
infrastructure; and other measures specified in the
Tenet work plan".

(spoke in French)

It is equally important, in that context, for Israel,
as called upon by the Secretary-General, to
immediately halt its military operations in Rafah and to
withdraw its troops without delay. After today's
butchery, Israel would be well advised to heed, for
once, the voice of reason.

Finally, I would again like to thank all the
members of the Security Council for their cooperation
and for their support for the text we have adopted,
which demonstrates that the Council is able to meet its
responsibilities and respond to the expectations of the
international community.
