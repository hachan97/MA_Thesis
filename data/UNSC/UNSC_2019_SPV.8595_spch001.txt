The President: On behalf of the members of the
Security Council, I should like to condemn in the
strongest terms the outrageous, deadly and totally
unacceptable attack on the United Nations that occurred
today in Benghazi, Libya. We understand that three
United Nations staff members were killed, and others
were injured. The members of the Security Council
convey their deepest condolences to the families of the
victims. Those brave workers were operating under a
mandate given by the Council in order to provide a more
secure future for the people of Libya. We commemorate
their ultimate sacrifice in the cause of peace.

I ask those present to now rise and observe a minute
of silence for those killed.

The members of the Security Council observed a
minute ofsilence.
