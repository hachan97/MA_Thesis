Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): For
several days now, the Islamic State in Iraq and the
Levant and other terrorist organizations have launched
a series of deadly terrorist attacks at multiple locations
across the world, killing innocent civilians, including
a Chinese citizen. The Chinese Government strongly
condemns the heinous atrocities committed by terrorist
organizations. The perpetrators must be brought to
justice.

Terrorism is the common enemy of all humankind.
All terrorist acts, regardless of their motivation,
timing, location or perpetrators, are grave criminal
acts that threaten international peace and security.
The international community must join hands to act
in accordance with the purposes and principles of the
Charter of the United Nations and other basic norms
of international relations. It must give full play to the
leading role of the United Nations, further strengthen
coordination and cooperation in counter-terrorism, and
form a united front against terrorism.

Counter-terrorism efforts must address both the
symptoms and the root causes of the problem, and
refrain from adopting double standards. The full
implementation of Security Council counter-terrorism
resolutions must include combating terrorists' use of
the Internet to instigate and plan terrorist activities and
to spread extremist ideas. Measures must also be taken
to cut the terrorists" financing channels and halt their
cross-border movements.

The Chinese Government firmly opposes all forms
of terrorism and firmly combats all violent terrorist
crimes that challenge human civilization. The fight
against the East Turkestan terrorist forces, headed by
the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, is an important
component of the international counter-terrorism
struggle. We will further strengthen our cooperation
with the international community on counter-terrorism
in order to safeguard world peace and stability.
