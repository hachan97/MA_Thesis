The President: Let me express my sincere
gratitude to all delegations for their substantive
contributions to our discussion today. I believe that this
debate has proved its timeliness and usefulness.

The need to conduct regular reviewing of the
implementation of the decisions taken by the Security
Council was one of the major motivations that
prompted the Ukrainian presidency of the Council to
convene this debate. Indeed, such reviewing could
become one of the concrete means of ensuring that the
Council's decisions are put into action. The presidency
is very encouraged by the many action-oriented
comments and practical proposals that have been put
forward by delegations with a View to contributing to
the realization of commitments undertaken by the
Security Council at its summit meeting. The presidency
believes that it is very important not to waste these
proposals and we will think very carefully, in
consultation with all members of the Council, about the
most appropriate way of putting them in writing in
order to formalize, as the Ambassador of Ireland put it,
a result-focused outcome of this debate.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 5.50pm.
