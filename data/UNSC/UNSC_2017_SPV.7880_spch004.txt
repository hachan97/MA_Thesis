Mr. Bermudez (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): First
and foremost, I would like to welcome the Minister
for Foreign Affairs of Cote d'Ivoire, Mr. Marcel
Amon-Tanoh, and to thank him for attending today's
meeting. Similarly, allow me to thank the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of
the United Nations Operation in Cote d'Ivoire (UNOCI),
Ms. Ai'chatou Mindaoudou, for her comprehensive
briefing, as well as to commend her efforts and the
work of the entire UNOCI team.

Uruguay welcomes the most recent report
(S/2017/89) of the Secretary-General on the situation in
Cote d'Ivoire. We note that the country has continued
to make great strides in strengthening its institutions,
which is key to achieving sustainable peace. Above
all, we commend the progress made through the
recent holding of a constitutional referendum and
peaceful legislative elections, as well as in promoting
and protecting human rights, fostering national
reconciliation and promoting cross-border cooperation
to combat the scourge of terrorism.

Almost a year ago, the Security Council ended the
sanctions regime imposed pursuant to resolution 1572
(2004). We believe that, to date, the Government has
been responsible in its approach and we encourage it
to continue its efforts. We are aware that there is still a
long road ahead, but we are certain that Cote d'Ivoire is
now on the right path to peace and the rule of law.
