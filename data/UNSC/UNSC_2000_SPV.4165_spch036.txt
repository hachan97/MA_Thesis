The President (spoke in French): I thank the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General for his
useful clarifications after a long debate that, I am
happy to say, has been exemplary in that both the
questions and the answers were very precise and
informative. I believe that reflects the Security
Council's interest in this unprecedented endeavour
under way in East Timor under United Nations
auspices. I think it was exemplary also because of the
common ground that was apparent in the comments,
and because of the Security Council's unanimous
support for the Special Representative.

I thank Mr. Vieira de Mello and hope that he will
be able to meet with us in a few months' time and to
tell us of fresh progress in every area of his
endeavours.

The meeting rose at 2.10 p.m
