The President (spoke in French): In accordance
with the understanding reached among Council
members, I wish to remind all speakers to limit their
statements to no more than five minutes. I stress this
matter, so that the Council can carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate their texts in writing and
to deliver the condensed versions in this room.

As another measure to optimize the use of our
time, in order to allow as many delegations as possible
to take the floor, I will not individually invite speakers
to take seats at the Council table, nor will I invite them
to resume their seats at the side of the Council
chamber. When a speaker is taking the floor, the
Conference Officer will seat the next speaker on the
list at the table.

I thank Council members for their understanding
and cooperation.

The first speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Iraq, on whom I now call and invite
to make his statement.
