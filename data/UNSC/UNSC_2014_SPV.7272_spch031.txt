The President: There are two matters I want to
mention before we go to our next speaker. First, I said
earlier that we had 101 sponsors for resolution 2178
(2014). I have just received an update that we now
have 104 sponsors. I think that it is worth noting the
overwhelming interest and support on this issue.
Consistent with our earlier agreement and past
precedent, as I mentioned, we have opened this forum
to leaders of countries that are not currently on the
Council, but obviously have an extraordinary, deep
interest, not only in the problem that we are discussing
today - the issue of foreign fighters - but also are
critical to our ability to solve the problem. I would
therefore now welcome and give the floor to His
Excellency Mr. Haider Al-Abadi, Prime Minister of the
Republic of Iraq.
