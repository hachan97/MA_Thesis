Mr. Samvelian (Armenia): The people of Nagorno
Karabakh chose their path to the future and democracy
a quarter of a century ago. That path is irreversible.
Finalizing and formalizing that process is the only way
to bring stability and security to the region, and for that
there are two requirements - compromise and realism.

A couple of delegations have made accusations
about my country, and I would strongly encourage
them to read the meeting record of my Ambassador's
statement when it becomes available, since it addresses
those accusations very effectively. Nonetheless, one
claim was made by the representative of Azerbaijan
with regard to a new referendum conducted yesterday
in Nagorno Karabakh. It is ironic that a country with a
poor human rights record can challenge or question a
referendum that represents one of the highest possible
exercises of their human rights by the people of
Nagorno Karabakh.

Clearly no one, especially Azerbaijan, can deprive
the people of Nagorno Karabakh of their right to
organize a referendum. I do not want to go into detail
over this, but it is about a difference in perceptions
of democracy. I will confine myself to bringing to
the Council's attention to two major pieces of news
yesterday and today in the region. Googling to satisfy
curiosity will show that a referendum was conducted
in Nagorno Karabakh, giving the population an
opportunity to express their will regarding their future
lives, development and constitutional reforms. The
top news item in Azerbaijan at the same time was
about a decree signed by the President of Azerbaijan
appointing the country's First Lady to be the country's
First Vice-President.

That is all I will say in bringing the Council's
attention to the differences between us in our
perceptions of democracy.
