Mrs. Perceval (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): Ijoin
other speakers in expressing my confidence, on behalf
of the delegation of Argentina, in Korea's leadership
during the month of its presidency. I also express my
recognition and gratitude to the Nigerian presidency of
last month.I also thank the Under-Secretary-General
for Political Affairs, Mr. Feltman, for his briefing on
the situation in Ukraine.

We are meeting for the second time this week to
discuss once again the alarming situation in Ukraine,
showing that the Security Council has a responsibility
to express - and for Argentina, to reiterate - its
concern that wide-scale violent confrontations could
result from the growing tensions. The alarming reports
coming from Solviansk suggest that such confrontations
have occurred and that there is a serious risk of entering
into a spiral of violence with grave consequences for
Ukraine, the region and the international community.

Argentina condemns the acts of violence reported
in eastern Ukraine that have claimed human lives.
Unfortunately, the calls by the members of the Council,
the Secretary-General and the international community
on all parties to seek to calm the situation, exhibit the
greatest of self-control and to contribute to constructive
dialogue have not been heeded. The spirit compromise
shown in Geneva has deteriorated rapidly and must be
recovered in order to find a political and diplomatic
solution to the crisis.

It must be made clear to all parties that a peaceful
solution to the difficult situation in Ukraine cannot
be achieved through unilateral acts of any sort. It is
particularly crucial that all parties fully respect human
rights law and international humanitarian law, respect
the rights of all minorities and ensure that all actions
are strictly within international law.

The only solution that Argentina, like the rest of
the international community, considers desirable and
necessary is that reached through an inclusive national
dialogue with the participation of all of the parties
involved. However, to launch such a dialogue process
and move towards a solution, it is crucial to create
conditions conducive to negotiation, build confidence
among the various communities and provide assurances
to all Ukrainians throughout Ukraine that their main
concerns will be addressed, with full respect for
Ukraine's right to see to its internal affairs.

We have witnessed further confrontational rhetoric
once again, speeches fomenting hate, discrimination,
hostility and violence, and actions that serve only
to escalate the already highly volatile situation.
All of this seriously undermines any effort by the
international community to encourage the parties to
enter into constructive dialogue towards a peaceful
politico-diplomatic solution to the crisis.

It is therefore crucial that the most influential
actors engage in constructive diplomacy, refrain from
confrontational rhetoric and use their influence on the
parties for progress in the effective implementation
of the measures agreed on 17 April in Geneva. Those
measures are necessary, indeed indispensable, for
de-escalating tensions and finding a way out of the
cr1s1s.
Finally, human lives are at stake and regional
stability is at risk. Respect for the founding principles
of the Charter of the United Nations must be ensured,
including the universal principles of the territorial
integrity, sovereignty and political independence of
Ukraine. The Security Council has met several times
in a short period to address this situation, but we have
not manifested the capacity to play a constructive
role to find a way out of the crisis. Members' calls
to de-escalate tensions, exercise restraint and pursue
dialogue have no effect because they are not coherent.
We have not been able to send out a message in a
single voice or to take any sort of action. But it is not
too late. The worst can still be averted. Perhaps the
Council will - it should - be able to send the same
message today as the one the Secretary-General made
today, in the same terms, in the same spirit and with
the same convictions, that is, that we must assume
our responsibility to maintain international peace and
security.
