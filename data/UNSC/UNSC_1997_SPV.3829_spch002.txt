Mr. Deinde Fernandez (Central African Republic):
Let me take this opportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on
your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council
for the month of November.

May I, on behalf of my Government, express to the
members of the Council our sincere gratitude for the
important draft resolution it is about to consider. We are
confident that, with the great wisdom that exists in this
Chamber among members of the Council, a suitable
solution will be found before February for the
continuation of the Inter-African Mission to Monitor the
Implementation of the Bangui Agreements (MISAB).

 

Once again, I pledge my Govemment's full
cooperation with the Council, the Secretary-General and
MISAB to strengthen and promote the cause of peace and
democracy, and to create all the necessary conditions for a
better life for all the people of my country, the Central
African Republic.
