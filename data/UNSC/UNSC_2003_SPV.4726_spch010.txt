The President (spoke in French): Before I call on
the next speaker, I would like to request that, in view
of the long list of speakers, all delegations refrain from
congratulating the President so that we can hear all the
speakers on the list. I again ask all speakers to limit
their statements to five minutes, as I asked, so that we
can conclude our work within the time allowed. We
currently have 72 speakers on our list.

I now call on the Permanent Representative of
Egypt.
