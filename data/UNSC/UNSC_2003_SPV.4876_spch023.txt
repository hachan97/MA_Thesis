Mr. Rosenthal: I have just one brief point of
information I would like to share with the members of
the Council. The Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Burundi,
under the chairmanship of Ambassador Kumalo, visited
Burundi a week ago. Its members are Burundi,

Ethiopia, France, Japan and South Africa. I joined them
as President of the Economic and Social Council; and
the Permanent Mission of Angola joined them as the
Chairman of the Ad Hoc Advisory Group of African
Countries Emerging from Conflict. We hope that the
report - the collective opinion of the members of that
Group - will be ready in early January. Of course, we
will share it with the members of the Security Council
as soon as it is ready.
