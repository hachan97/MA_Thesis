Mr. Gaspar Martins (Angola): Today we have
adopted resolution 2241 (2015) to reconfigure the
mandate of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan
(UNMISS), taking into account the signing of the
Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the
Republic of South Sudan by the South Sudanese parties
and the international stakeholders, in particular the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development. This
was possible thanks only to the cooperation of all the
members of the Council.

We voted in favour of the resolution despite the
fact that, as we have said, the fragile Agreement just
signed is aimed at ensuring a ceasefire and the end of
violence in South Sudan. It is not a perfect document,
but it is the basis for the current discussions between the
parties. The Council needs to continue to keep a very
close watch on the parties and listen to their concerns
and reservations if it is to be of assistance instead of
creating new problems that could create a situation
that we would have to address when it comes to the
implementation of the Agreement.

Our vote today expresses our support for the mission
of UNMISS and the troops, despite the differences of
views among the members of the Security Council on
a number of issues, including the use of unmanned
aerial vehicles, the balance between accountability
and reconciliation, the role of the United Nations in
the establishment of the hybrid court and the adoption
of the new configuration. The question of sanctions
remains very sensitive, and I think that the Council will
have to address it with extreme care in order to avoid
creating problems rather than resolving them.

We believe that the actions of the Council should
be in support of the discussions of the African Union
Peace and Security Council, which is the main
partner of the Security Council in matters related to
international peace and security and stability in the
African continent.
