Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I believe that Mr. Hoxhaj's comments are an
attempt to lead the discussion away from the topics that
we have been discussing today.

With regard to the events in Crimea, I would like
to recall that over 80 per cent of voters in Crimea took
part in the referendum there, unlike in the elections
in Kosovo, which some members of the Council have
said involved a high level of participation and in which
only 41 per cent of voters took part. As a result of
the referendum in Crimea, over 90 per cent of voters
voted in favour of independence. Only then was a
decision made to include Crimea as part of the Russian
Federation.

With regard to the comments that Mr. Hoxhaj
did not like concerning the fact that the most recent
report of the Secretary-General (S/2014/558) does not
mention the participation of Kosovars in the conflict
in Syria and Iraq and the fact that Kosovo has adopted
legislation that prohibits such activity, the point
was to draw attention to the fact that in his previous
report (S/2014/305) the Secretary-General specifically
mentioned those issues, and today, in spite of the fact
that the report was in fact published two weeks late,
those facts were not duly reflected.
