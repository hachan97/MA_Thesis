Ms. Paik Ji-ah (Republic of Korea): The Republic
of Korea remains deeply concerned over the situation
in Ukraine, particularly the escalation of tensions in the
Crimean region. Given the tense situation, we call on
all parties to exercise maximum restraint and surmount
the crisis through dialogue. It is vital that the unity,
independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty
of Ukraine be fully respected in accordance with the
Charter of the United Nations. The Republic of Korea
hopes that the situation in Ukraine will be settled in a
peaceful manner. In that vein, we support the mediation
efforts of the international community, particularly
those of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
We hope that the Deputy Secretary-General's visit to
Ukraine will help to explore all possible responses to
the situation.
