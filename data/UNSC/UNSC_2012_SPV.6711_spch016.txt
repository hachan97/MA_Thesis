The President (spoke in French): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as representative of
Togo.

Togo had hoped that the situation that has
prevailed in Syria for almost a year would allow the
Security Council to send a strong message to the
leaders and opposition in that country to end the
violence and embark on a process of political
negotiation that is inclusive and transparent. It was for
that reason that Togo voted in favour of the draft
resolution submitted by Morocco, and was a sponsor of
the text. Unfortunately, the Council was not able to
send this message to the Syrian political class, and my
country deplores this state of affairs. Our Council,
which has the primary responsibility for maintaining
international peace and security, has failed once again
to bring peace and security to Syria by speaking with a
single voice.

Despite that failure, the Council should be able to
continue to seek ways and means to bring peace to
Syria. The Syrian people should not continue to suffer,
cry and bury their dead as our Council remains
impassive. The Security Council must act. Togo
continues to believe that it is not too late for it to
resolutely commit itself on the path of the necessary
action that must be taken.

I now resume my function as President of the
Council.

I now give the floor to the representative of the
Syrian Arab Republic.
