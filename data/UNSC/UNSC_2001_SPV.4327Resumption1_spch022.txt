Mr. Annabi: I do not think there were any
specific questions addressed to Mr. Guehenno, and I
know that members are eager to move on to their
meeting with troop-contributing countries. I would like
just to express our thanks to members of the Council
for their kind words of appreciation regarding the work
done by the United Nations Organization Mission in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) and
by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General
in support of the peace process in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo. I will gladly convey those
expressions of appreciation to Mr. Morjane. I will also
convey to him the good wishes expressed by members
of the Council for his prompt recovery. As members
know, he was unable to be here today because he is
recovering from malaria.
