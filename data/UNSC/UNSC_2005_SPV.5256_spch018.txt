Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
should like at the outset to thank Mr. Volcker for his
briefing and the Secretary-General for his statement.

China appreciates the work of the Independent
Inquiry Committee over the past year. We believe that
the inquiry will enable all parties to better understand
the problems that occurred in the oil-for-food
programme. The report just presented by Mr. Volcker
contains more than 1,000 pages involving a series of
recommendations and important issues. China will
study the report closely, and we look forward to future
Council discussion of it.
