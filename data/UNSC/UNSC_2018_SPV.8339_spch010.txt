Ms. Samson (Netherlands): Allow me to wish you
and your team, Madam President, the best of luck for
your presidency this month, which starts off in a very
interesting and transparent way. Allow me also to thank
the United Kingdom and its delegation for an exemplary
presidency during the month of August.

We thank the United States presidency for
proposing its provisional programme of work,
which we support. It includes some very important
discussions, including on corruption and peacekeeping
operations, and we look forward to discussing under
your guidance a number of pertinent issues, including
from a preventive perspective, such as the situation in
Nicaragua. We therefore reiterate our support for the
provisional programme of work and look forward to the
month of September.
