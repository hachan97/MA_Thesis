Mr. Alfassam (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At the
outset, Ijoin previous speakers in condemning the two
terrorist attacks in Afghanistan yesterday. We express
our heartfelt condolences to the Government and the
people ofAfghanistan and wish those who were injured
a speedy recovery.

The State of Kuwait voted in favour of resolution
2489 (2019), as we believe that it is important to extend
the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission
in Afghanistan to provide the necessary support for the

Government and the people of Afghanistan during the
next phase.

In conclusion, we express our appreciation for
the great efforts of the co-penholders - Germany
and Indonesia - which enabled the adoption of
the resolution unanimously, thereby reflecting the
unity of the Security Council regarding the situation
in Afghanistan.
