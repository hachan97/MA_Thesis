The President: Before opening the floor, I would
like to say that, in accordance with the understanding
reached among Council members, I would like to
remind all speakers to limit their statements to no more
than five minutes in order to enable the Council to
carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with
longer statements are kindly requested to circulate a
full text in writing and to deliver a condensed version
when addressing the Council in this Chamber.
