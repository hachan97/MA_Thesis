Mr. Jagne (Gambia): My delegation is grateful to
Mrs. Ogata for her comprehensive briefing on a subject
of particular concern and interest to the international

 

community: the perennial problem of the plight of refugees.
We are particularly delighted to note that the Office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
has established closer ties with the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS), as far as the West
African subregion is concerned.

As the High Commissioner has rightly pointed out,
West Africa has had its fair share of conflicts, but, with the
great regional efforts deployed so far, peace is gradually
being restored to the region. It goes without saying,
however, that as we have limited resources we will need
the support of the rest of the international community to
complement our own efforts. The most recent example is
the recent signing in Abuja of the agreement between the
Government of Guinea-Bissau and the self-proclaimed
military junta which, inter alia, guarantees free access to
humanitarian organizations and agencies to reach the
affected civilian population. That is very commendable
indeed; it is the way it should be, for no degree of political
expedience is worth the sacrifice of human lives in a
ruthless and inconsiderate manner, such as the denial of
access to humanitarian assistance.

We hope that the rest of the international community
will heed our appeal so that the momentum generated is
maintained for the consolidation of the peace process in all
the countries that Mrs. Ogata mentioned in her briefing this
morning.
