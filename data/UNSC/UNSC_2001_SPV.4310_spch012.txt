The President: I am going to suspend this
meeting until 3.45 p.m., with a number of
representatives still wishing to speak; I too wish to
make a brief national statement. We have to come back
this afternoon anyway for a further meeting, on the
Angola monitoring mechanism. I understand that the
Under-Secretary-General is travelling, and I hope that
he will be represented at a senior level from within the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations.

The meeting was suspended at 1.20 p.m. and
resumed at 3.50pm.

The President: With the agreement of the
Council, I extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Hedi Annabi,
Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping
Operations, and invite him to take a seat at the Council
table.

I shall now call on those members of the Council
that have indicated their wish to speak.
