The President: Before we start our proceedings I
wish, on behalf of all the members of the Security Council,
to bid a fond farewell to our dear colleague Ambassador
Jean-Bernard Merimee, who, I am sad to say, is leaving
New York for his new post as Ambassador of France to
Italy.

Here in the Council we shall all miss his enlightened
presence. His presidency of the Council in the month of
May was a paragon of judiciousness, efficiency and, above
all, wit and good humour. In my own work, during the
current month, I have found myself constantly looking back
to the way he conducted our proceedings, and to his
innovative approach to the delicate and critical matters
which are always before us.

But, if I may speak as Ambassador of Italy, the
Security Council's loss is Italy's gain, for I know that in
my capital the very high qualities that we have been so
privileged to enjoy will be equally appreciated.
