Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): I wish to
congratulate the Republic of Korea on its assumption
of the presidency of the Security Council for this month
and to express appreciation to the Ambassador of
Nigeria and her team for their outstanding leadership of
the work of the Council last month. I also wish to thank
Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Feltman
for his briefing.

In recent days, the situation in some areas in south-
eastern Ukraine has been characterized by ongoing
tensions and escalation that have resulted in casualties.
That is a matter of deep concern to China. China has
indicated on many occasions its principled position
on the question of Ukraine. We hope that the parties
concerned will proceed from the need to safeguard
the fundamental interests of various ethnic groups in
Ukraine, maintain regional peace and stability, keep
calm, exercise restraint and avoid further deterioration
of the situation.

A political solution is the only way out of the
crisis in Ukraine. A fundamental settlement to the
crisis in Ukraine needs to take into consideration the
history and the reality, and accommodate the legitimate
rights, interests and aspirations of various regions and
ethnic groups within Ukraine, as well as the legitimate
concerns of all parties, so as to achieve a balance of
their interests.

For some time, various parties, including China,
have worked actively to promote peace and facilitate
negotiations. The four-party talks in Geneva among the
Russian Federation, the United States, the European
Union and Ukraine agreed on the need to take measures
to de-escalate the situation in Ukraine. We hope that
the parties concerned will stick to dialogue and
consultations, effectively implement the agreements
reached, forcefully promote the process of political
settlement and achieve stability and development in
Ukraine as soon as possible.

China calls on all parties to seek a political
settlement to the question of Ukraine through dialogue,
not confrontation. We will continue to support
international good offices that will help to de-escalate
the situation and promote a political settlement.
