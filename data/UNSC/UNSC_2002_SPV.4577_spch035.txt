The President: I thank all of our speakers this
morning, in particular for their discipline in relation to
time. I would now like to return to Foreign Minister
Koroma and Foreign Minister Fall, and just ask if they
have any very brief comments they would like to make
in response to what they have heard this morning. I call
on the Foreign Minister of Sierra Leone, Mr. Koroma.
