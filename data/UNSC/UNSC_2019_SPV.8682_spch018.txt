The President: I shall now make a further
statement in my capacity as the representative of the
United States.

Any discussion of a new road map or Security
Council draft resolution must bear in mind the reality
that, over the past year and a half, the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea has continued to advance
its prohibited programmes, tested its prohibited
programmes and repeatedly refused to engage in
sustained diplomatic engagement. We have not asked
North Korea to do everything before we do anything.

The United States is prepared to be flexible in how
it approaches this matter. We recognize the need for a
balanced agreement and parallel actions that address
the concerns of all parties. In fact, we have taken many
steps to bring about a resolution through dialogue and
have conveyed this message clearly to North Korea. But
we need a committed negotiating partner to take the
reciprocal actions required for progress. We are happy
to consider ideas put forth by our counterparts that
could advance the agreement that President Trump and
Chairman Kim agreed to in Singapore, and if they do,
we can work together to achieve such an outcome.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

I give the floor to the representative of the Republic
of Korea.
