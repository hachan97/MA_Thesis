Mr. Serry: I shall be very brief. Today has been a
long and important debate, given its timing. We have
all recognized the critical nature of the situation, and
many have been appealing for prudent and restrained
actions at this sensitive time. That is something that
we have also been underscoring, if we are not going to
lose sight of the two-State solution altogether. For my
part, I will remain stubbornly committed to that shared
objective.

Let me thank the Nigerian delegation for the smooth
manner in which today's debate was conducted. I would
like to thank all Council members and other speakers
for having expressed appreciation for my work.
