Mr. Cherif (Chad) (spoke in French): I welcome the
presence among us of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs
of Australia, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

Chad reiterates its deepest condolences to the
families of the 298 victims and to the States that lost
citizens in the crash.

Chad commends Australia on its initiative. We
also welcome the consensus among all the members
of the Security Council with regard to resolution 2166
(2014), which we have just adopted. We also welcome

the commitment and resolute determination of the
Council to give an effective and appropriate response
commensurate with this tragedy.

By sponsoring and voting in favour of this
resolution, Chad hopes that full light will be shed on
this heinous crime, which has taken nearly 300 innocent
lives. In that connection, Chad demands guaranteed
unhindered access to the crash and for the security of
the international experts on the ground, so that they can
fully independently and with complete transparency
carry out the investigation under the authority of the
Government of Ukraine, the International Civil Aviation
Organization, the Netherlands and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe. We underscore
the need to safeguard the integrity of the crash site, so
as to make it possible for the investigation to deliver the
results expected of it.

The perpetrators of this tragedy must be identified
and brought to justice. All the States Members of the
United Nations must cooperate in establishing the facts
and ascribing responsibility.
