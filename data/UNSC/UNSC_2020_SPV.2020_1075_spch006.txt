I would like to begin my statement by reiterating my delegation's full support for the good offices of the Secretary-General. Indonesia underscores the pivotal role being played by the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) in maintaining a conducive environment for the peace process. We would like to urge all parties to continue to engage constructively with MINURSO in pursuing peace and security. For that reason, Indonesia welcomes the renewal of the MINURSO mandate, and voted in favour of resolution 2548 (2020). We believe that the resolution reflects a delicate balance, considering the sensitivity of the issue, the absence of a personal envoy and lack of an active political process. Indonesia therefore urges the Secretary-General to appoint, without further delay, a new personal envoy who can continue and expand the good work of the previous envoy, Mr. Horst K6ehler. Any further delay would become a significant impediment to the political process for finding a solution acceptable to all parties. We thank the United States of America as penholder for its approach in preparing the text. We also commend the constructive engagement of all parties in the political process, and call on them to remain committed and to extend their fullest support and cooperation to the personal envoy to achieve progress towards a political solution.
