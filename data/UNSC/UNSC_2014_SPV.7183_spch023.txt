President Nikolie (spoke in Serbian; English interpretation provided by the delegation): I do not
intend to make any comments on the statements by the
Council members; they reflect the positions of their
Governments. By commenting, I would perhaps put the
citizens of my country at odds with the positions taken
by some countriesjust because I do not agree with some
Council members. I would simply ask members, when
thinking about this problem, to think as if it happened
in their own country. I wish that such a situation never
occurs in other countries.

I wanted to address the Council again to thank
members for their condolences and compassion towards
the citizens of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and
Croatia who have suffered due to the terrible flooding.
Without international help, they will face great
difficulties in alleviating the consequences. There is
life beyond politics, outside of these walls, but I know
that we will manage to live with the consequences with
the help of our friends.
