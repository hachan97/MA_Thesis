The President (interpretation from French): There
were 15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 1153 (1998).

Before adjourning the meeting, with the Council's
permission, I would like to express the hope that the
Secretary-General's mission to Iraq will be crowned with
success.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of

its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 4.35 pm.
