The President: I thank the Secretary-General for
his briefing.

I now give the floor to those Council members who
wish to make statements.

Recalling the Security Council's latest note 507 on
its working methods (S/2017/507), I wish to encourage
all participants, both members and non-members of
the Council, to deliver their statements in five minutes
or less.
