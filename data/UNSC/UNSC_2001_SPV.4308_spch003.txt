The President: I thank the Assistant Secretary-
General for his extremely useful report and for taking
the trouble to visit East Timor and report back to us so
soon. It is a very important subject on the Council's
agenda.

We have started a speakers' list. I shall turn to
members of the Council in a second. The Council
should remember that, to some extent, this is an interim
briefing. We are expecting a report of the Secretary-
General towards the end of this month. There will be, I
expect, a major debate on East Timor in early May.
Subject to the decision of the Council at that time, I
would expect that meeting to be open to the
participation of non-members of the Council.

I will now give the floor to members of the
Council who wish to speak. If Mr. Annabi wishes later
to come back in and interact and respond to other
people's interventions, there will be an opportunity for
him to do that.
