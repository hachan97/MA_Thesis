The President: In accordance with rule 39 of
the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite
the following briefers to participate in this meeting:
Mr. Herve Ladsous, Under-Secretary-General for
Peacekeeping Operations; Mr. Charles Bent, Deputy
Police Commissioner of the United Nations Mission
in South Sudan; Mr. Pascal Champion, Police
Commissioner of the United Nations Organization
Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo; and Mr. Gregory Hinds, Police Commissioner
of the United Nations Mission in Liberia.

The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2015/844, which contains a letter
dated 5 November 2015 from myself, the Permanent
Representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland to the United Nations, addressed
to the Secretary-General, transmitting a concept note
on the item under consideration.

As we have a number ofparticipants in this meeting
on this important issue, I encourage speakers to make
concise interventions. The intention of this meeting
is to be as interactive as possible, as we were in the
same briefing last November and as we are in our
individual dialogues with Force Commanders. We are
looking forward to questions from Council members
to the Commissioners and from the Commissioners to
the Council. To that end, brief interventions will allow
more time for subsequent exchanges, and I remind
speakers that the presidency will use the flashing lights
on the collars of the microphones to prompt speakers to
bring their remarks to a close.

I give the floor to Mr. Ladsous.
