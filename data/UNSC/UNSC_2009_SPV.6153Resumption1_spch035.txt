Ms. Malcorra: I would like to thank all the
members of the Council and the other representatives
who were involved in this very useful conversation.
Let me just say, very briefly, what our next steps are
going to be.

Clearly, the New Horizon non-paper, to which
Alain has just referred, is a chapeau work that will be
derived from different initiatives, in particular the
support strategy that we have briefly discussed today.
The initial non-paper that we are going to issue in July,
which we referred to earlier today, will be an initial
step to serve as a basis for consultation, not a final
document. It will be a way to start a feedback
mechanism that will provide reasonable grounds on
which we can base discussions.

Of course, as I said earlier today, our idea is to
have a document to submit at the next session of the
General Assembly for adoption. We have no doubt that
the support strategy will have some implications that
will require General Assembly approval.

We have listened today. We will continue to
listen. We hope to be very engaged so that, by the time
we have to issue a formal document for approval by the
General Assembly, we will have sufficiently
understood the concerns and views of Member States
and have come to a conclusion that Member States are
ready to endorse. This will continue for the next few
months, during which we will be speaking a lot with
Member States.
