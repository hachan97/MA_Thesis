Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): The current political and security situation in the Central African Republic is improving overall. The Government of the Central African Republic is committed to implementing the Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in the Central African Republic and is actively making progress in the implementation of the benchmarks for the arms embargo assessment. China commends those efforts. China has always believed that sanctions are not an end in themselves but rather a means to the end, which is to help the Central African Republic to restore national stability and a normal social order at an early date. The Security Council should base itself on the actual situation on the ground in the Central African Republic, particularly the aspirations of its Government, and lift the arms embargo sanction measures against the Central African Republic as soon as possible. That will help the Government of the Central African Republic to strengthen its capacity to maintain national safety and security and facilitate the political settlement of the Central African Republic issue. China wishes to thank France, the penholder, for its efforts. However, resolution 2507 (2020) failed to fully respect the wishes of the Government of the Central African Republic regarding the lifting of the arms embargo, nor did it reflect the constructive ideas of some members of the Security Council. China therefore had no choice but to abstain.
