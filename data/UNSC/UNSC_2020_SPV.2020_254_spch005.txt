Concerning the Constitutional Committee, despite the hard work of the Special Envoy, there seems to be little reason for optimism. Yes: it is positive that the issue concerning the agenda is resolved. However, the tactics of Damascus seem to be to stall the process rather than to strive for the Committee to be fully functional. Discussing process is important but the Committee's goal is to have qualitative discussions on different issues to further the implementation of Security Council resolution 2554 (2015). This is what the Syrian people need and deserve and what is essential if Syria is to have a viable future. We call upon all parties to take this point fully to heart. Finally, we reconfirm our position that we will not fund reconstruction before a political solution is firmly under way.
