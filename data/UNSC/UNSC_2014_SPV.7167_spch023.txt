Ms. Power (United States ofAmerica): I wouldjust
like to offer a couple of points in response.

First, for the Russians to blame Ukraine for
Ukraine's actions in defence of its own people on its
own territory really is starting to remind me of the
story of the schoolboy who returned home with his nose
bloody and his shirt torn and, asked by his mother how
the fight started, he said "it started when the other boy
hit me back". We have to be clear about cause and effect
here, and many Council members, including me, have
already gone through the facts that have brought us to
this point.

My second point is to debunk yet another of the
lies that have been told in this Chamber, because it
relates to my country, the United States. People in this
Chamber have heard many times, including just now,
that the United States and other countries never called
oon protesters in the Maidan to leave buildings or
avoid violence. The implication is that we are holding
Russian separatists to a different standard. That is a
claim that has been made in almost every meeting we
have had. I would just like to correct the record. On
15 January, we condemned the actions of rioters outside
a Kyiv court building on 10 January. On 22 January,
the aggressive actions of members of the extreme-right
group Pravy Sektor were unacceptable, enflaming
conditions on the streets and undermining the efforts
of peaceful protesters. We condemned the targeted
attacks against journalists and unofficial groups such
as Titushky. On 24 January, when protesters occupied
some regional administration buildings, we reiterated
our call for all protesters and Government forces to
refrain from violence and the destruction of property.
On 27 January, we made clear that we condemned the
use of violence to seize Government buildings, such
as the takeover of a Ministry of Justice building that
took place over the past cople of days and of a public
exhibition hall that weekend, and continued to reiterate
our call for all protesters and Government forces to
refrain from violence and the destruction of property.
Those are just a few of the statements that we made, but
if we could just take that particular lie of the table, it
would be helpful and a little more constructive.

What is more important now is where we go
from here. What I would ask my Russian colleague
is whether Russia will make public statements and
work privately behind the scenes to urge Russian
separatists to negotiate peacefully their departure
from public buildings. Where does Russia assess that
Russian separatists who claim loyalty to the Russian
Government and who wear uniforms just like those of
Russian soldiers obtained weapons and training capable
of shooting down Ukrainian helicopters?

Finally, Russia repeatedly takes aim at the so-
called illegitimate Government in Kyiv but refuses
to acknowledge ever, in any meeting, that it did not
embrace the 21 February agreement when it was
negotiated. We have a golden opportunity on 25 May for
the people of eastern Ukraine to have their voices heard,
for them to choose their own leaders and for us to get to
a universally legitimate Government that is respected
and chosen by all of the people of Ukraine. Yet Russia
will not come out in support of the elections and work
with us to ensure that they take place - which would
be the best way of ensuring rights, representativeness
and greater autonomy for the people of eastern Ukraine.
