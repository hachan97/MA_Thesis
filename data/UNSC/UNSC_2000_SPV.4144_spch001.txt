The President (spoke in Chinese): The Security
Council will now resume its consideration of the item
on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2000/440, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Bangladesh, Canada, the
Netherlands, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and the United States of America.

I should like to draw the attention of the members
of the Council to the following documents:
S/2000/430, letter dated 15 May 2000 from Ethiopia,
transmitting a letter of the same date from the Minister
for Foreign Affairs of Ethiopia; S/2000/435, letter
dated 15 May 2000 from Ethiopia, transmitting a
communique of the sixty-fourth session of the Central
Organ of the Organization of African Unity; and
S/2000/437, letter dated 12 May 2000 from Portugal,
transmitting the declaration by the Presidency of the
European Union on behalf of the European Union.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution (S/2000/440)
before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the
draft resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, China, France,
Jamaica, Malaysia, Mali, Namibia, Netherlands,
Russian Federation, Tunisia, Ukraine, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America

The President (spoke in Chinese): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1298 (2000).

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.
The meeting rose at 11.50 p.m.
