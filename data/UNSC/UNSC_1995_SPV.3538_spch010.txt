The President (interpretation from French): I now put
to the vote the draft resolution contained in document
S/ 1995/394.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Argentina, Botswana, China, Czech Republic, France,
Germany, Honduras, Indonesia, Italy, Nigeria, Oman,
Russian Federation, Rwanda, United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland

Against: United States of America

The President (interpretation from French): There
were 14 votes in favour and 1 against. The draft resolution
has not been adopted, owing to the negative vote of a
permanent member of the Security Council.

I shall now call on those members of the Council who
wish to make statements following the voting.
