Mr. Cunningham (United States of America):
We, too, are disappointed that one member of the
Security Council was not prepared to support the
Secretary-General's request to adopt this draft
resolution before the referendums in order to provide
assurances to Greek Cypriots that the security
structures provided for in the settlement would be in
place before they vote on 24 April.

I note that the vote demonstrates that the
opposition to the draft was isolated and that it is clear
that the other members of the Security Council took a
very different view, in support of the Secretary-
General. Nonetheless, it is very clear to us that, if the
settlement is approved by all Cypriots in the
referendums on Saturday, there would be very rapid
action in the Security Council to establish the United
Nations Settlement Implementation Mission in Cyprus
and an arms embargo.

We want to note also that this draft resolution,
which was supported by an overwhelming majority of
the members of the Security Council, would have
provided for the establishment of the United Nations
Settlement Implementation Mission in Cyprus as well
as the arms embargo. That demonstrates the obvious
and strong support of the international community for
implementing all aspects of the United Nations
settlement, which provides for the return of more than
120,000 Greek Cypriot refugees to their former homes,
a comprehensive property compensation and restitution
system and the withdrawal of almost all Turkish troops
from the island.
