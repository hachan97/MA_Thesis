Mr. Shen Bo (China) (Spoke in Chinese): Thanks
to the joint efforts of the Liberian Government and
the international community, Liberia's national
reconstruction and economic development have got back
on track in the past few years. The Liberian Government
has shouldered its responsibility for safeguarding
national security and has made progress with security
legislation, weapons marking and border control.
China appreciates the positive efforts of the Liberian
Government and the Liberian people to safeguard
national peace and stability, and congratulates them on
their achievements in nation-building.

The Security Council has lifted the sanctions on
Liberia. That represents the international community's
recognition of Liberia's peace process and national
development. We hope that the international community
will continue to provide Liberia with the assistance it
needs to consolidate peace and to bring its national
reconstruction and economic development to new
levels, on a basis of respect for its national sovereignty.
