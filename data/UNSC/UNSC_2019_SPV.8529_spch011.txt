Mr. Allen (United Kingdom): The Council has
voted on whether to have a meeting on this subject, and
we know the result. There is no meeting on the subject.
The representative of the Russian Federation is not
giving an explanation of vote. He is giving a substantive
intervention on a meeting that is not happening. In
so doing, Mr. President, he shows disrespect for the
Council and for the ruling that you just gave him,
asking him to limit his remarks to procedural concerns.
I would therefore like to ask you to ensure that the
Russian representative follows the rules of the Council,
limits his remarks to an explanation of vote and does
not give a substantive intervention for a meeting that is
not happening.
