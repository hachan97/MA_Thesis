The President: I would like to thank the President of
the Republic of Zambia for his very, very important
statement, especially in view of the fact that he represented
the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
during difficult negotiations. I am very glad that the flu did
not fell him and that he is here to speak. I wish also to
thank him for the very kind words he addressed to the
American presidency.

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Joaquim
Alberto Chissano, President of the Republic of
Mozambique.
