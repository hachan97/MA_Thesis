Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
thanks Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo, Assistant
Secretary-General Mueller, the Chief Monitor of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine,
Ambassador Apakan, and the Special Representative
of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office in Ukraine and in
the Trilateral Contact Group, Ambassador Sajdik, for
their briefings.

China always adopts an objective and impartial
position on the issue of Ukraine. We respect the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries,
including Ukraine, and oppose interference in that
country's internal affairs by any foreign forces. China
is of the View that the signing of the new Minsk
agreements and its endorsement by the Security
Council in February 2015 have played a crucial role
in the political mediation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Over the past four years, all parties have held the
agreement in high regard. However, regrettably, many
provisions of the agreement are yet to be fully and
effectively implemented.

The political mediation process of the Ukrainian
crisis has stalled. There are still difficulties in effectively
ensuring the safety of people's lives and property in
the conflict area. We call on the relevant parties to
effectively implement the new Minsk agreements,
remain committed to a political settlement, overcome
the current problems through dialogue and consultation
and seek a comprehensive solution to the crisis with
a view to achieving peace, stability and development
in Ukraine, harmony among its ethnic groups and
peaceful coexistence between Ukraine and countries in
the region.
