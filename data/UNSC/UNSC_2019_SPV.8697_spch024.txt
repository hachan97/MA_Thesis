The President: Regardless of the outcomes of the
votes today, it is clear that there is a commitment from
the Security Council to help the Syrian people and to
save lives. The presidency will work closely with the
co-penholders to ensure that negotiations continue over
the coming days and that we find a solution that we can
all support.

As this is the last scheduled meeting of the Council
for the month of December, I would like to express my
sincere appreciation of the delegation of the United
States to the members of the Council, especially my
colleagues the Permanent Representatives, their teams
and the secretariat of the Council for all of the support
it has given us.

At the beginning of the month, I said that the
theme of our presidency was to look ahead to 2020 and
to think about what we should be doing as a Council
to make the world a better place. I appreciate my
colleagues work to do just that, and we look forward to
a new year filled with potential within the Council. But
we could not do any of our work without the hard work,
support and positive contributions of every delegation
and representatives of the Secretariat, including the
conference service officers, interpreters, verbatim
reporters and security staff.

As we end our presidency, I know I speak on
behalf of the Council in wishing the delegation of
Viet Nam good luck in the month of January. I would
like, on behalf of the Council, to express our sincere
appreciation to the five outgoing members: Cote
d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Kuwait, Peru and Poland.
Over the course of the past two years, they and their
teams have become part of the Security Council family.
Their presence and positive contributions during their
terms on the Security Council are noteworthy, and they
will be missed.

The meeting rose at 1.40 pm.
