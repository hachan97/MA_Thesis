The President: In accordance with rule 39 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite
Mr. Alain Le Roy, Under-Secretary-General for
Peacekeeping Operations, to participate in this
meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to the report of the Secretary-General on the situation
in Abyei, which will be issued as document

I now give the floor to Mr. Le Roy.
