Mr. Quinlan (Australia): I have the honour to
present the report of the Committee established pursuant
to resolution 1737 (2006), in accordance with paragraph
18 (h) of that resolution. The present report covers the
period from 20 March to 24 June, during which time
the Conunittee held one informal meeting and two
informal informal meetings, and conducted additional
work using the no-objection procedure envisaged in
paragraph 15 of the guidelines for the conduct of the
Committee's work.

I would like to start with the final report on the
Panel of Experts' current mandate. The Council
received the report on 9 June and it is now available in
all United Nations languages in document S/2014/394.
As always, the report includes observations that
Member States may find useful for guidance in
implementing the measures in resolutions 1737 (2006),
1747 (2007), 1803 (2008) and 1929 (2010), and I would
like remind everyone of the importance of conveying
the report to the relevant sanctions implementation
authorities back home. The Committee itself had the
opportunity to discuss the report with the Panel on
2 June, as required in paragraph 2 of resolution 2105
(2013), and will consider whether any follow-up action
by the Committee is necessary, taking into account the
report's conclusions.

In its report, the Panel again notes that some States
have indicated a degree of uncertainty as to whether
Council resolutions concerning Iran remain fully in
force, as negotiations between Iran and the permanent
five members of the Security Council and Germany
enter a critical stage. I would like to emphasize once
again that only the Security Council itself can alter the
sanctions measures it has applied. Until there is a new
resolution of the Council on the issue, the measures in
resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007), 1803 (2008) and
1929 (2010) remain in full effect. The Committee stands
ready to provide guidance to Member States on the
application of the Council's measures to any transaction
and urges them to report any transaction they believe
contravenes the measures to the Committee.

In that regard, I would like to advise the Council
that the Committee received a report from a Member
State during the current reporting period, on 31 March,
of the interdiction in the Red Sea by its naval forces
of a cargo of conventional arms, including rockets,
mortars and ammunition, which were allegedly loaded
onto a vessel in the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. The
Panel of Experts, at the Committee's direction, carried
out inspections of the seized arms on 28 and 29 April,
and on 16 June submitted its report to the Committee.
The Committee met this week, on 23 June, to discuss
this report with the Panel and is now considering its
response. Similarly, the Committee wrote to Iran on
27 March in relation to a carbon-fibre interdiction that
I referred to in my two previous reports, seeking Iran's
comments. Regrettably, Iran has not yet provided a
response.

On a happier note, cooperation between relevant
Security Council's sanctions committees, such as that
of the 1737 Committee with the Financial Action Task
Force (FATF), has continued. The Council will recall
that on 18 November of last year, the Chairs of six
Committees and the President of the FATF held a joint
open briefing for States Members ofthe United Nations.
On 30 April, the FATF President informed me that he
had organized a meeting for 22 June between the FATF
and financial experts from the sanctions expert groups,
including the Iran Panel of Experts.
