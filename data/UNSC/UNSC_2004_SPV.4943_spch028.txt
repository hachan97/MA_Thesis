Mr. Wolfensohn: I think there is such a rich
array of comments that, at this stage, to try to respond
to all of them would not be a good idea. Let me say
simply that I have been greatly impressed by the
discussions this morning. In fact, as any members
retire, they would be welcome on the Board of the
World Bank, if they are looking for a different career,
because it is clear that there is a significant community
of interests between the work of this Council and the
work of the Bank.

The one thing that I am frustrated about is that I
am unable to articulate to members the extent to which
we are already engaged in the issues of framework for

business, demobilization, dealings with low-income
countries, ensuring investments of leading small- and
medium-sized enterprise financing, advocating trade
and working on the New Partnership for Africa's
Development. Our institution is right in the middle of
many of the individual issues that members have
raised. Let me simply say that we welcome this
additional opportunity to work with the United Nations
system. If the Council does indeed follow the
suggestion that the subject of today's discussions
become a point of greater emphasis in the Council's
deliberations, we stand ready to work with and support
the Council in any way it would find useful.
