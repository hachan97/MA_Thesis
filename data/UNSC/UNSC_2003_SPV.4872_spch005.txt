Mr. De La Sabliere (France) (spoke in French):
France voted in favour of the resolution that created a
new committee in charge of taking over from the 661
committee, which concluded last Friday, in order to
ensure the follow-up of the implementation of freezes
and transfers of the financial assets of the Government
of Saddam Hussain in Iraq and of high officials of his
regime, as provided for in Security Council resolution
1483 (2003). It was particularly important to ensure,
from a practical and technical standpoint, the
continuity of the monitoring of the implementation of
those financial sanctions.

The possibility of broadening the mandate of the
new committee to include monitoring the arms
embargo, as defined in paragraph 10 of resolution 1483
(2003), is a step in the right direction. Indeed, we
attach great importance to monitoring the
implementation of sanctions, and, in particular, of
embargoes adopted by the Security Council.

In this regard, the sanctions committees,
subsidiary organs of the Security Council, are
irreplaceable instruments that the Council, in its
exercise of sanctions, systematically establishes. For
reasons of principle related to the coherence of the
Security Council's practice in monitoring the
implementation of sanctions, and bearing in mind the
current situation in Iraq, it would seem particularly
desirable that the new committee be able, as soon as
possible, to monitor compliance by States with the
arms embargo against Iraq. In the meantime, this
monitoring should be ensured directly by the Security
Council.
