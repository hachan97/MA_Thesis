Mr. Matjila (South Africa): South Africa thanks the
Secretary-General for his report on the implementation
of resolution 2420 (2018), on the arms embargo on
Libya (S/2019/380). We thank the United Kingdom as
penholder for facilitating this process.

My delegation remains deeply concerned that the
current military operations in Libya are reportedly
being reinforced by the transfer of arms into the country,
including by sea and by land. We are further concerned
by the suspension of the naval assets of the European
Union military operation in the Southern Central
Mediterranean, which are crucial to the implementation
of the arms embargo resolution on the high seas.
Furthermore, we encourage regional cooperation in the
implementation of the arms embargo.

It has been two months since the crisis started in
Libya, without any respect being shown by the parties
to the conflict for the Council's calls for a ceasefire.
The worsening security and humanitarian situation in
Tripoli is fuelled by the constant supply of arms to that
city. South Africa reiterates that there is no military
solution to the Libyan crisis. It is through a national
dialogue process that the conflict can be resolved.
As such, we encourage compromise, cooperation and
a spirit of reconciliation on the part of all the parties
in Libya.

We strongly urge Member States to fully
implement the arms embargo measures, which are of
immediate importance to the protection of civilians and
the restoration of security and stability in Libya and
the region.

Lastly, South Africa wishes to reiterate that
sanctions are a tool to advance a political process or
facilitate a change in the political process and should
not affect the provision of humanitarian assistance.
We therefore support the adoption of resolution 2473
(2019) and hope that all Member States will adhere to
its implementation.
