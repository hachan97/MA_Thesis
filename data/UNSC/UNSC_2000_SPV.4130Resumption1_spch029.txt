The President: I thank the representative of
Indonesia for the kind words he addressed to me.

It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/2000/335) before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall
put the draft resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

A vote was taken by show of hands.

 

In favour; Russian Federation, Tunisia. Ukraine, United
Argentina, Bangladesh. Canada, China, France, Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern lreland,
Jamaica. Malaysia. Mali, Namibia. Netherlands. United States of America

The President: There were 15 votes in favour. The
draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1296 (2000).

There are no further speakers on my list.

The Security Council, having offered its President
great flexibility and generous support, has thus concluded
the present stage of its consideration of the item on the

agenda.

The meeting rose at 5.55 p.m.
