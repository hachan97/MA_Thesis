The President (interpretation from French): I thank
the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Tunisia for his kind
words addressed to me. The next speaker is the Minister for
Foreign Affairs of Canada, His Excellency the Honourable
Lloyd Axworthy. I welcome him, and I invite him to take
a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
