Mr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): A short time ago we adopted resolution 1506
(2003), something we should have done many years
ago.

Syria is pleased at the lifting of sanctions against
the fraternal people of Libya. It has voted in favour of
the resolution because it was the result of an
understanding reached between all the parties
concerned. Syria, which has expressed its condolences
to the families of the victims, also recognizes that the
fraternal people of Libya have suffered a long time
because of the siege and the unjust sanctions imposed
against them. Syria believes that the Council must not
impose sanctions that will adversely impact the civilian
population and that will expose children, women and men
to suffering under collective sanctions that are
unacceptable under international law and the Charter.
