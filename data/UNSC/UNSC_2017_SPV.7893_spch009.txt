Mr. Rosselli (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): As a
signatory to the code of conduct regarding Security
Council action against genocide, crimes against
humanity and war crimes, Uruguay is committed
to preventing and putting an end to such horrendous
crimes. In that regard, we can only lament the use of
the veto in the case of this draft resolution (S/2017/172).
My delegation believes that ensuring accountability for
the use of chemical weapons in Syria is essential, not
only for reasons ofjustice but also to put an end to and
prevent such heinous acts.

It was not a perfect text, but it did constitute a
first step towards ensuring accountability for the
use of chemical weapons in the Syrian conflict,
based on the conclusions of the third and fourth
reports (see S/2016/738/Rev.1 and S/2016/888) of the
Joint Investigative Mechanism, which established
responsibility for four out of nine alleged cases of
use investigated. The sanctions regime that we were
prepared to implement, like other Council sanctions
regimes in force, could subsequently have been
reviewed and improved upon by the panel of experts
that would have been established for that purpose.

We reiterate that these crimes must not go
unpunished, whether committed by the members of the
Government, the Syrian armed forces, terrorist groups
or non-State armed groups. We call on all members of
the Council to continue to seek consensus that would
allow us, as soon as possible, to adopt measures to
punish those responsible, and therefore to prevent new
incidents of chemical-weapon use against the already
hard-hit civilian population of Syria.
