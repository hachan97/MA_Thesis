The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Timor-Leste, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Guterres
(Timor-Leste) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Sukehiro
Hasegawa, Special Representative of the Secretary-
General for Timor-Leste and Head of Mission of the
United Nations Office in Timor-Leste.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Hasegawa to take a seat at the
Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2005/533, which contains the progress
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
Office in Timor-Leste.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Sukehiro Hasegawa, Special
Representative of the Secretary-General for Timor-
Leste and Head of Mission of the United Nations
Office in Timor-Leste. I now give him the floor.
