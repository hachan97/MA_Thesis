Mr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): Allow me,
first of all, to thank you, Mr. President, for convening
this meeting, which will facilitate a thorough debate of
the situation in Guinea-Bissau at a particularly
opportune moment, given that the Security Council
mission to West Africa will visit that country in a
week's time. We are certain that today's debate will
enrich the content of our meetings in the field.

The latest report of the Secretary-General on
Guinea-Bissau (S/2003/621) clearly states that the
overall situation has worsened and that it is on a
downward spiral. The political and institutional
instability, the lack of a clear separation between
executive, legislative and judicial powers and
uncertainty with respect to elections are all cause for
concern. With regard to the latter point, we attach
particular importance to the holding of elections as
soon as possible, so long as the necessary conditions
are in place to guarantee that the elections are free and
fair.

Moreover, the human rights situation and the
worsening socio-economic situation are also priority
issues to which the Guinea-Bissau authorities must
devote their efforts, with the support of the
international community.

In addition to the role being played by the United
Nations system, including the Bretton Woods
institutions, we also welcome the efforts being made at
the subregional level, in particular by the Organization
of Portuguese-speaking African States and the
Economic Community of West African States. We urge
those organizations to pursue their activities in this
area, since the strengthening of regional and
subregional mechanisms is extremely important in the
African context.

In conclusion, the statements we have heard in
this meeting reflect the willingness of the international
community to support the essential efforts that must be
made by Guinea-Bissau's leaders to ensure that the
country will emerge from its current crisis.
