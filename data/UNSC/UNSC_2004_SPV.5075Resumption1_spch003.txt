The President: I thank the Secretary General of
NATO for his statement.
Lord Ashdown is expected momentarily; he has
been meeting with Secretary-General Annan. I had
planned at this point to call on him for additional
comments or responses. In his absence, I might ask the
Secretary General, while we have the time, to comment
on the status of Bosnian defence reform. My
understanding is that this will be an ongoing
responsibility of NATO. I was wondering how he saw
things as going at this point, and, if he could look into
his crystal ball, how he sees the future.
