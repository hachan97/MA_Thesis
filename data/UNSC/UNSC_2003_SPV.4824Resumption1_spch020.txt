The President: I was just doing some mental
arithmetic. The meeting started close to on time and
speakers have been averaging five and a half minutes
each. The Council did agree it was going to be three
minutes per speaker. May I therefore appeal to speakers
to abide by that? I have a gavel and a watch, and I may
start to bash the gavel after three and a half minutes.
Speakers have been warned. I do want to respect the
request that we go into consultations following the
meeting.

The next speaker is the representative of India, on
whom I now call.
