Mr. Gaspar Martins (Angola): Like my
colleague from Germany, I too would like to join other
colleagues in commending the President personally for
enabling these difficult negotiations to produce
something that is good for the parties and that can
make it possible for us to uphold the recommendations
of the Secretary-General's Personal Envoy - the
Baker plan - and of the Secretary-General. I think
that, after so many years, we now have a good basis
upon which the parties and the countries of the region
can together build a sound country in Western Sahara. I
would also like to say that the principle of self-
determination has been kept as the basic principle for
negotiation. That is very positive.

I would like to commend the parties for the
political will they have demonstrated. I hope that this
will be maintained down the road, as the road map that
now exists constitutes a very sound basis upon which
they can build together. They can count on the support
of the international community. I also wish to say that
we in Angola would like to be able to build upon the
relations that already exist among all the countries in
the region that are party to this arrangement.
