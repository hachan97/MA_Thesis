Mr. Malwal (South Sudan): I would like to
congratulate you, Sir, on China's accession to
presidency of the Security Council for the month of
November. Our delegation is pleased and ready to work
and cooperate with you during your tenure.

On behalf of the Government of the Republic of
South Sudan, I would like to thank the Council on its
decision to renew the mandate of the United Nations
Interim Security Force for Abyei. We would like
to thank the Ethiopian Government for its valuable
commitment and dedication to maintaining peace and
stability in Abyei. The Government of the Republic of
South Sudan would like to reaffirm its commitment
to keep engaging the Council in pursuit of finding a
final solution to the Abyei issue. The Republic of South
Sudan is determined to take advantage of the current
rapprochement in the bilateral relations between the
Republic of the Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan,
as well as the current positive regional developments,
to reassure the communities in the Abyei area that a
satisfactory solution will be found soon.

The meeting rose at 9.45 a.m.
