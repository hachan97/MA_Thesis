Mr. Tarar (Pakistan): Today is indeed an
important day for the peaceful resolution of the
situation in Syria. It is also proof that the Security
Council can indeed come together to fulfil its role in
the global scheme of things. We are deeply
appreciative of the spirit of accommodation exhibited
by all Security Council members.

The Council's adoption of resolution 2042 (2012)
is an important step in our overall objective of
12-29516

promoting a peaceful political solution to the situation
in Syria, with full respect for that country's unity,
sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Council's
unanimous support of that objective sends a strong and
unambiguous message of unity and commitment,
urgency and responsibility, in addressing a situation
that has had tragic humanitarian consequences and that
has the potential to negatively affect an already fragile
regional situation.

A central element of the resolution is the
Council's unanimous and strong support for the efforts
of the Joint Special Envoy, Mr. Kofi Annan. His efforts
and mission have not only brought the Council together
around a common platform, they have also given us
hope for the success of our collective goal. This is an
example of how preventive diplomacy and mediation
can deliver under principles of objectivity, balance,
engagement and dialogue. Pakistan has backed the
Special Envoy's mission from the outset, and we will
continue to support his efforts. We believe that all sides
in all quarters should cooperate fully with him to
ensure the success of his mandate. Any steps or actions
that might undermine his work should be avoided. We
hope that the Council will stay the course in its
collective pursuit of a peaceful political settlement of
the Syrian crisis.
