The President (spoke in Chinese): Under rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite
the representative of the Syrian Arab Republic to
participate in this meeting.

I once again wish to remind all speakers to limit
their statements to no more than four minutes, in order
to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.

I now give the floor to the representative of Israel.
