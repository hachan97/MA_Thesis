Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I will be really brief.
Ijust want to say one thing to my colleague the Russian
Ambassador. I thank him for his queries about the
World Health Organization. That suggests to me that we
should get together with the Office for the Coordination
of Humanitarian Affairs and others to really drill down
into what the problem is with deconfliction and the
coordinates, because it obviously is a problem.

But I want to say to the representative of Syria that
first, I am not embarrassed, and secondly, I did not hear
the assurances that I was asking for. I want to state for
the record that I did not get the assurances that I was
asking for about the civilians in Idlib and protection
from air strikes.

The meeting rose at noon.
