The President: I thank the Foreign Minister of
South Africa for her kind words addressed to the
American presidency. I hope that she will be able to
remain with us as long as her schedule permits - I know
how tight it is - because, after the round of comments,
we hope to follow what we call the "Greenstock rules"
and have a very open exchange of Views involving, first
and foremost, President Chiluba, the President of the
General Assembly and herself.

Our next speaker is my friend the representative of
Algeria, speaking on behalf of the Organization of
African Unity. We regret that Mr. Salim Salim had to
return unexpectedly to Africa, but the representative of
Algeria is a more than inadequate substitute.
