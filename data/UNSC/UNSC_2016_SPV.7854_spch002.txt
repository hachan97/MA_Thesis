Ms. Sison (United States of America): Today's
adoption of a short-term extension of the processes and
escrow accounts related to winding up the oil-for-food
programme brings us a step closer to closing the book
on that programme. The Government of Iraq and the
United Nations requested this temporary extension to
tie up a few outstanding issues. The United Nations and
the Government of Iraq have made substantial progress
on this file in the past year, having held successful
negotiations and resolved a number of complex legal
matters. We hope that both parties might take today's
adoption as an indication of the Security Council's
support for their efforts to close this file once and
for all.

The meeting rose at 10.05 am.
