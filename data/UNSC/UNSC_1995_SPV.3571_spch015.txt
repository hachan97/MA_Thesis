Sir John Weston (United Kingdom): The events of
1993 which inspired this resolution were tragic; they
marked the beginning of very difficult times for Burundi,
which have, regrettably, continued to the present day.

The United Kingdom Government shares the concern
expressed by others at the continuing instability in
Burundi. We believe that the culture of violence and
impunity is a major factor in the troubles there, and hope
that the Commission will identify those responsible for
the events of 1993 and thus help counter this climate of
impunity.

This resolution sends a clear message that those
responsible for grave violations of humanitarian law will
be held responsible for their actions. The British
Government therefore strongly supports the establishment
of a Commission of Inquiry, and my delegation is pleased
to have co-sponsored the resolution which provides for
this.

We believe that the strengthening of the Burundi
judicial system is vital to the stability of Burundi and
look forward to receiving the Commission's
recommendations on the measures necessary to prevent
any repetition of the kind of events which took place
during 1993.

The cooperation of the Government of Burundi and
all Burundi political parties will be vital if the
commission is to succeed. We therefore trust that the
Commission will be given the necessary access by the
Government of Burundi and that the security of its
members will be guaranteed.
The resolution calls on States to contribute to the
Trust Fund for the Commission to enable its work to start
promptly and effectively. The United Kingdom will be
making a contribution of Â£20,000 for this purpose.
