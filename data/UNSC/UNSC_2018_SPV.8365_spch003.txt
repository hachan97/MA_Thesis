Mr. Allen (United Kingdom): I thank all Council
members for their support for resolution 2437 (2018),
which renews for a further 12 months the authorization
for Member States and regional organizations to inspect
and to seize vessels on the high seas off the coast of
Libya being used for migrant smuggling or human
trafficking from Libya. I welcome the comments of
my French colleague and his support for the resolution.
We reiterate our full support for the European
Union military operation in the Southern Central
Mediterranean and the critical work being carried out
by operation SOPHIA in the Mediterranean.

Let there be no doubt - the resolution that we
have adopted today sets out the same legal obligations
regarding the implementation of those authorizations
as resolution 2380 (2017), resolution 2312 (2016)
and resolution 2240 (2015), which established the
authorization in 2015.

The meeting rose at 3.10pm.
