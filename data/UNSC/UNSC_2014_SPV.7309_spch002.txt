Mr. Kullane (Somalia): Somalia thanks the entire
Security Council for its efforts in Somalia in all areas,
including piracy. We welcome both the long-term and
short-term recommendations, suggestions and solutions
set out in resolution 2184 (2014).

We again convey our thanks to the Council and
assure it of our full cooperation on all matters, including
piracy.
