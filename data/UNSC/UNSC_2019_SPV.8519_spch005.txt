The President: I thank Mr. Onanga-Anyanga for
his briefing.

I think that colleagues around the table will agree
that this is not one of the less complicated conflicts that
we are following.

I now give the floor to those Council members who
wish to make statements. In this context, I would like
to point to our hourglass, which, for the last day of our
presidency, has been refilled with fresh sand. We hope
that this is an incentive for members to abide by the
time indicated, which is now five and half minutes.
