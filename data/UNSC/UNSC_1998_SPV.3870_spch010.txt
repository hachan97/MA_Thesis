Mr. Amorim (Brazil): Over the past few months we
have been receiving repeated reports of persistent violence
in some areas of the Great Lakes region, in particular
Rwanda. In December 1997, in Mudende, a massacre of
civilians, including refugees, shocked the world and showed
that the cycle of Violence in Rwanda was far from coming
to an end. The ethnic conflicts have been fuelled by the
illegal flow of arms that ravages this area.

The draft resolution on which we are about to vote
reactivates the work of the International Commission of
Inquiry on arms flows, originally created by resolution 1013
(1995).

The new mandate of the Commission, according to the
draft resolution before us, would encompass information
and investigation on the sale, supply and shipment of arms
and related materiel to former Rwandan government forces
and militias in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa.
Additionally, the Commission would be requested to
identify parties aiding and abetting the illegal sale to or
acquisition of arms by former Rwandan government forces
and militias. Finally, the Commission would make
recommendations relating to the illegal flow of arms in the
Great Lakes region.

In order to develop its work, the Commission will
have to count on the cooperation of the Governments of the
States concerned, of relevant United Nations bodies and of
other organizations and interested parties.

This month the Council will examine the report of the
Secretary-General on Africa. On that occasion, we will be
able to discuss the root causes of conflicts in Africa,
including the particular aspects involved in the Great Lakes
region. It is to be hoped that this will afford the Council an
opportunity to debate possible solutions for the structural
problems that still beset many African nations.

Brazil understands that actions such as the one we
are taking today represent an effective, if limited,
contribution towards peace and security in the area.
