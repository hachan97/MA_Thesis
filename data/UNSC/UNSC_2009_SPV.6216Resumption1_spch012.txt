Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): I have the honour to
address the Security Council on behalf of the
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and to begin by
expressing appreciation to the Minister for Foreign
Affairs and the delegation of Austria for organizing
this important debate under its presidency and to thank

the Secretary-General, Under-Secretary-General
Holmes and the Deputy High Commissioner for
Human Rights for their introductory remarks.

The year 2009 marks the tenth anniversary of the
Security Council's first thematic debate on the
protection of civilians in armed conflicts, as well as the
sixtieth anniversary of the 1949 Geneva Conventions,
which focus on minimizing the negative impacts of the
horrors of war and violence on the civilian population.
Nevertheless, with all the efforts exerted by the United
Nations, including the Security Council, civilians are
still suffering around the world in massive numbers
and the measures that have been adopted so far have
proved to fall short of addressing the wider
implications of attacks against civilians and their
impact on international peace and security.

In this regard, the Non-Aligned Movement
believes that due priority should continue to be given
to promoting knowledge of, respect for and observance
of States parties' obligations assumed under
international humanitarian law, in particular those of
the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their 1977
Protocol. We call upon all parties to armed conflict to
redouble their efforts to comply with their obligations
under international humanitarian law by, inter alia,
prohibiting the targeting of civilian populations,
civilian property and certain special property during an
armed conflict, and obliging parties to any conflict to
ensure general protection against dangers arising from
military operations for civilian installations, hospitals
and relief materials, as well as the means of
transportation and distribution of such relief materials.

The Movement reiterates its condemnation of the
increasing attacks on the safety and security of
humanitarian personnel and urges the Governments of
United Nations Member States to ensure respect for
and the protection of the personnel of humanitarian
organizations, in conformity with the relevant
provisions of international law. In the meantime, we
reaffirm that humanitarian agencies and their personnel
should respect international humanitarian law and the
laws of the countries in which they operate, the guiding
principles of humanitarian assistance set forth in
General Assembly resolution 46/182 and its annex, and
non-interference in the cultural, religious and other
values of the population in the countries in which they
operate.
As for using weapons which are of an
indiscriminate nature and that lead to massive
causalities among the civilian population, the
Non-Aligned Movement stresses its concern at the
threat to humanity posed by the continued existence of
weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear
weapons, and of their possible use or the threat of their
use. We continue to believe that more remains to be
done with regard to disarmament and the
non-proliferation of these weapons. In that regard, the
Movement continues to deplore the use, in
contravention of international humanitarian law, of
anti-personnel landmines in conflict situations, aimed
at maiming, killing and terrorizing innocent civilians,
denying them access to farmland, causing famine and
forcing them to flee their homes, eventually leading to
depopulation, and preventing the return of civilians to
their places of original residence. The Movement calls
upon all States in a position to do so to provide the
necessary financial, technical and humanitarian
assistance to landmine clearance operations and the
social and economic rehabilitation of victims, as well
as to ensure full access by affected countries to
material, equipment, technology and financial
resources for mine clearance.

In the same vein, taking into account the
magnitude and persistence of the violations and
breaches of international law, including international
humanitarian law, being committed by Israel, the
occupying Power, in the occupied Palestinian territory,
the NAM. calls upon the Council to take all necessary
measures to ensure respect for and compliance with the
Geneva Conventions in that situation.

Let me conclude by reiterating the importance of
the role of the General Assembly and the Security
Council, not only with regard to enhanced involvement
with respect to the protection of civilians in conflict
situations but also in order to focus on the need to
investigate violations of international humanitarian
law, without discrimination. The NAM. believes that
the Council should alter its practice to attach priority to
the protection of civilian population in imminent
danger in conflict situations at an early stage and
separate this issue from the discussions that take place
in the Council with regard to the controversial political
dimensions of a conflict, in order to save as many lives
as possible among affected civilians trapped between
the combatants in conflict areas.
