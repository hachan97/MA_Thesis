Mrs. Kawar (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): At the
outset, allow me to reiterate our condolences to the
Government and the people of France over the atrocious,
cowardly terrorist acts that struck Paris last week. We
also pay homage to the victims of the bloody, criminal
terrorist acts committed recently in the Sinai, Beirut,
Susa, Ankara, Baghdad, Libya and, just today, in Mali.
Those reprehensible acts demonstrate beyond a shadow
of a doubt that terrorists are seeking to destroy our
common values of coexistence and that the war against
terrorism has indeed become a global one. That makes
it imperative that all of us be united in both word and
deed.

Jordan welcomes the adoption of resolution 2249
(2015), which we voted in favour of because it reflects
our belief in the need to strengthen and coordinate
international efforts to combat the terrorist organization
known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria
(ISIS) 4 perverts who wreak havoc and evil across
the globe and who are undeterred in demonstrating
their odious intentions towards humankind in targeting
civilians. Targeting and defeating ISIS and other
terrorist groups requires action from all of us and a
response commensurate with the magnitude of the
challenge. It also requires international action and
serious collective effort at all levels and on all fronts,
including military, security and intellectual. There is
also a need to suppress the financing of terrorism.

We are very pleased that the Council has adopted
this resolution by unanimity, demonstrating the unity
of the Security Council in combating ISIS and sending
a powerful message to that terrorist organization and
other terrorist groups. Jordan reiterates its ongoing
resolve to combat terrorism in every possible way and
to work to coordinate and bolster international efforts
to confront terrorism and violent extremism.
