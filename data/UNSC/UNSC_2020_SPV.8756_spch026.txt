Mr. Sautter (Germany): I would just like to say two short things. First of all, I am encouraged to hear from our Russian colleague that Russia is taking the legal obligations under which we all stand seriously. As is often the case in life, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Secondly, with regard to my remarks on Syria, I should like to say that I have nothing to add and nothing to take away from what I said. The meeting rose at 12.15 p.m.
