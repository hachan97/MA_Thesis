Ms. Mustapha: I am happy to hear so many Council
members today say that people with disabilities will
no longer be invisible. I and so many others will be
watching to make sure that those words are turned into
action. Idlib is a perfect example of where that action
should take place in order to protect all civilians. In
terms of concrete action, the Council can make sure that
people with disabilities are included in all of its work,
resolutions, programmes and funding. I would like to
ask the Council to please make sure that our specific
needs are met, especially those ofwomen and girls with
disabilities. Today, for the first time, the Council has
given a woman with a disability a voice. My hope is that
from this day forward, this will be a regular occurrence
in the Council, so that it can hear from us first-hand and
never forget what we have talked about today. Let there
be nothing about us without us.
