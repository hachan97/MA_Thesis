Mr. Mulet: At the beginning of my briefing today,
I reported that, since 20 January, some negotiations
had been under way in Doha between the Government
and one faction of the Justice and Equality Movement
(J EM) under the auspices of Ms. A'i'chatou Mindaoudou
Souleymane, Deputy Joint Special Representative of
the Secretary-General and mediator. I am pleased to
report that, just a few minutes ago, the negotiating
parties in Doha - the Government of the Sudan and
the JEM. of Mohammed Bashir - signed a framework
agreement that sets out the basis on which the parties
will negotiate on the adoption of the Doha Document
for Peace in Darfur. I thought that that information was
pertinent for the members of the Council.
