Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The statement of the representative of Ukraine,
which featured simple allegations, was made with the
single goal of distracting from Kyiv's lack of resolve to
implement the Minsk agreements. Unfortunately, it was
no surprise that he made uncorroborated allegations
and siought to besmirch Russia. Ukraine blamed Russia
for the tragic incident of 23 April on the contact line,
when a vehicle of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission to
Ukraine exploded. We have heard an entire corpus of
similar allegations concerning similarly tragic incidents
in Ukraine, which usually come in the immediate
aftermath of the incident. Afterwards, when that
incident leads to an impartial investigation, Ukraine
falls silent. Today, we are seeing the very same thing
in spite of the fact that an international investigation is
already under way.

If anyone has any information or proof, they
should swiftly provide it to the specially established
investigative group led by the Deputy Chair of the
International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission.
They should do that rather than get into political
demagogery. We have our own data regarding the
incident, but we do not speculate about it so as not to
hamper the investigation.

That is why, instead of spreading uncorroborated
evidence, we must deal with the actual peace process.
That is especially true because the Ukrainian statement
said the right thing 4 namely, that humanitarian
demining activities can begin only after the end
of the conflict. That, however, requires the swift
implementation of all provisions of the Minsk
agreements, first and foremost in the political field,
the provision of a special status for certain areas of
the Donbas and the holding of elections, as well as
rebuilding the economic and banking systems and the
provision of amnesty.
