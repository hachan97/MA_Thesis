The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Kieran Prendergast, Under-Secretary-
General for Political Affairs.

It is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document 8/2004/302, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on Cyprus.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Kieran Prendergast, Under-Secretary-
General for Political Affairs, to whom I give the floor.
