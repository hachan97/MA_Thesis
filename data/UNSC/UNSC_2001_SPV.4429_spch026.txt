The President: As I indicated earlier, we had
intended to have an interactive dialogue, but in view of
the comments and questions, I will now ask Judge
Jorda, Judge Pillay and Chief Prosecutor Del Ponte to
respond in turn to the questions raised and any
comments they might also wish to clarify.

I give the floor first to Judge Jorda.
