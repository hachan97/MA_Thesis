Mr. Eldon (United Kingdom): Welcome, Sir, to
New York and to the Security Council. As others have
said, it is a real pleasure to see you here today.

 

The safety and security of United Nations and
associated personnel, and of humanitarian personnel, are an
issue of vital importance to the United Kingdom. We are a
significant contributor of troops, military observers and
civilian police to United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Many more of our nationals serve as humanitarian staff in
the field. Like other Council members, we owe a duty of
care to those we deploy to do vitally important jobs in
conditions which are all too often dangerous and
unpleasant. The United Kingdom is one of the relatively
few Member States that have ratified the 1994 Convention
on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel.

Against this background, we should clearly continue
to analyse all proposals for United Nations operations to
ensure that these risks are kept to a minimum and, where
they cannot be avoided, that United Nations personnel are
given the means to ensure their own security.

We welcome the proposals and ideas set out in the
Deputy Secretary-General's statement, not least her
admonition on resources. In the case of our own foreign
service, security for staff is regarded as one of the
prerequisites for delivering our objectives and funded
accordingly as a core activity.

I should also like to say how much I appreciated the
eloquence of Ms. Bertini's contribution today.

We, absolutely rightly, have a very long speakers" list
on this important subject. Thus, in the interests of brevity,
I will not go beyond these rather general points today, but,
like the representative of France, I would like to draw
members' attention to the statement that the Permanent
Representative of Portugal will be making on behalf of the
European Union later in this debate, which the United
Kingdom fully supports.
