Mr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): My
delegation voted in favour of the resolution for the
reasons we stated a few days ago in this Chamber,
which were based on the two main ideas contained in
last week's declaration by the Council of Ministers of
the European Union.

Spain opposes any terrorist acts, whatever their
source and whatever their motivation may be. A bomb
in a bus in Tel Aviv, a bomb in a train in Madrid, a
bomb in a building in New York or in Casablanca -
all are terrorist acts. They are all equally reprehensible
and unjustifiable. We condemn them in the strongest
terms and my delegation has made every effort to
embody this idea in operative paragraph 2 of the
resolution.

But, we are also opposed to and condemn
extrajudicial executions. The Security Council could
not remain passive in the face of the act committed
three days ago. It was contrary to international law and,
as has been stated here, it will disastrously fuel tension
and hostility in the region.
