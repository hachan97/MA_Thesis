Mr. Van Bohemen (New Zealand): New Zealand
voted against the draft resolution submitted by the
Russian Federation (S/2016/847) due to its partial and
misleading nature and Russia's destructive role in
the Syrian conflict and because Russia provided no
scope for any negotiation on a text on such a sensitive
issue - an issue to which Russia is a direct party.

Action of this kind only serves to deepen the
divides in the Council that are preventing constructive
action from being taken. As you earlier observed,
Mr. President, New Zealand has been working on some
ideas to try and bring the Council together on this
most difficult issue. That we have not yet put our ideas
forward has been our decision and ours alone, but I
invite Russia and all Council members to work with us
in the coming days to see if we can chart a course in a
more positive direction.
