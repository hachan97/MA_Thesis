Mr. Dejammet (France) (interpretation from French): The Tajik parties are engaged in a process of
national reconciliation. This is a long and difficult
undertaking, but the Government and the opposition alike
are increasingly demonstrating their readiness to
cooperate. We welcome in particular the intention stated
by the two parties to establish a joint security unit to
provide security mainly in the central part of the country,
which remains the most exposed area.

The French delegation is fully aware that the
security situation in Tajikistan remains precarious. That is
why we attach great importance to the measures the
Secretary-General will be taking to provide, as far as
possible, for the protection of the personnel of the United
Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT)
and of the international organizations in the field.

 

We are, however, convinced that the United Nations
should now help the Tajiks restore peace to their country
and rebuild it. The maintenance of international peace and
security has never been risk-free; the United Nations must
shoulder its responsibilities, because a lack of support from
the Organization could hamper the rapid and complete
implementation of the General Agreement on the
Establishment of Peace and National Accord in Tajikistan.

It is in that spirit that France supports the expansion
of the mandate of UNMOT.
