Mr. Oyarzabal (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish):
First of all, I would light to commend the leadership
of Rwanda on the subject that brings us together today,
which has been expressed through other initiatives
and contributions that it has made during its two
presidencies of the Security Council, in April 2013 and
this month, in convening informative meetings of this
body to discuss the annual reports of the Peacebuilding
Commission (PBC), as well as in coordinating the
process aimed at promoting the joint participation of
the Council and the Commission in informal follow-up
and stock-taking of the progress and difficulties in the
interactions between the two bodies.

I would also like to specifically thank the President
of the Commission, Ambassador Antonio Patriota of

Brazil - and take this opportunity to congratulate
him on the success of the PBC's annual session last
June - and his predecessor, Ambassador Vladimir

Drobnjak of Croatia, for their statements.

As the co-facilitators pointed out in their report
of July 2010 (S/2010/393, annex) on the review of the
peacebuilding architecture, an effective response on
the part of the Organization requires developing a
broad-based and coordinated strategy for peacebuilding
that is based on identifying priorities on the part of
local authorities and that sets goals and concrete and
achievable time frames. The report also points out
that such work requires stepping up humanitarian
assistance efforts, re-establishing the rule of law,
drafting and implementing security and justice
policies, and promoting sustainable development and a
rigorous, democratic policy for protecting, promoting
and ensuring human rights. No doubt, that remains an
ongoing challenge.

We believe it necessary to support a strategy
for post-conflict peacebuilding based on three
elements: first, the principle of national responsibility;
secondly, United Nations coordination; and thirdly,
the complementarity of regional organizations. With
regard to the work of the Peacebuilding Commission
at its seventh session, we underscore the process led by
Rwanda aimed at strengthening the interaction between
the Council and the Commission so as to take advantage
of the Commission's important role in order to, inter
alia, identify risks and gaps in the peacebuilding
process; oversee a level of attention and commitment
by regional, national and international stakeholders;
promote coherence and harmonization among the
policies, activities and objectives of the United Nations
and other partners; and support the successful transition
of United Nations missions in countries included in the
programme, which is then reflected in the Council's
resolutions.

There can be no doubt that the integration and
coherence of peacebuilding and peacekeeping efforts
remain essential to achieving lasting peace and
security and to preventing relapses into conflict. In
that framework, the need to increase complementarity
has been established, as has the need to rationalize and
focus more attention on the socioeconomic dimension
of peacebuilding, in particular the development and
promotion of social well-being and not only poverty
reduction, while bearing in mind the promotion and
protection of human rights and the strengthening of the
rule of law in countries included on the agenda of the
Peacebuilding Commission that are also on the agenda
of the Security Council.

The role of the Peacebuilding Commission in the
area of promotion and support is closely related to
its function in mobilizing resources and cooperative
alliances. The United Nations occupies a privileged
position in mobilizing and making more efficient use of
financial, technical and political resources earmarked
for peacebuilding activities, and in establishing
agreements and strategic partnerships with regional and
other international stakeholders, while ensuring that all
efforts contribute to strengthening the institutions and
are in line with the country's priorities. The cooperation
of international financial institutions in particular with
countries that request their support and need it cannot
be carried out with a one-size-fits-all model or imposed
formulas, especially when those models and formulas
continue to be imposed when it is clear that they have
been a complete failure in other countries and regions
in terms of economic growth and social inclusion.

As the final element, with regard to the topic of
partnerships and the promotion of coherence, I will say
that the role of subregional and regional organizations,
in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter of the
United Nations requires the strengthening of the capacity
of regional organizations with a view to supporting
countries that need to recover and rebuild themselves
after a conflict. In that connection, I think it is useful
to incorporate South-South cooperation model, which
is governed by the principles of complementarity and
solidarity. The focus on South-South cooperation could
also be used to understand and guide the role of regional
and subregional cooperation, with the understanding
that the principles of complementarity and solidarity
should guide the situation because more than once we
have seen that the loss of security and destabilization of
a country has an impact on the security of neighbouring
countries and destabilizes their security. If a region is
unstable, we cannot expect the countries in the region
to develop and maintain security.

Lastly, the effectiveness of post-conflict
economic activities and economic growth, as well
as the improvement of the quality and the social
impact of economic recovery policies, depend on
the empowerment of women and their participation
on an equal footing with men and their access to
security and justice, as is recognized in the report
of the Commission (S/2014/67). In that context, it is
important for the Commission to continue to develop
its cooperation with UN-Women, which allows the
Commission to draw lessons and raise awareness with
regard to the transformative role of women in post-
conflict societies, including in the process of national
reconciliation with regard to planning, establishing
priorities and formulating and implementing policies.
Furthermore, we should take into account that while
there are common lessons to be drawn in all situations,
the focus in each case should be different and specific
to each situation.

In conclusion, as a member of the Security Council
and the Peacebuilding Commission, Argentina remains
hopeful for and will actively participate in the process
ofthe 2015 review of the Peacebuilding Commission, in
the conviction that it will be an opportunity to review,
inter alia, the progress achieved in the relations between
the two bodies and with the various agencies who have
operational responsibilities within the system, as well
as the role ofthe Peacebuilding Commission in resource
mobilization, in order to strengthen our response in
peacebuilding.
