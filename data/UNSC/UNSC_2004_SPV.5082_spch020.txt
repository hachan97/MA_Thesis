The President: It is a very special privilege to
welcome to the Security Council the Minister of
International Development of Norway. It is impossible
to overstate how important Norway has been to the
peace process. It has been central; it has played a
leadership role. Ms. Johnson has been involved for
years in this effort, always in a leadership capacity and
always very, very constructively.

I now give the floor to Ms. Hilde Johnson,
Minister of International Development of Norway, in
accordance with rule 37 of the Council's provisional
rules of procedure.
