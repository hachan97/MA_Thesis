The President: I thank Mr. Pascoe for his very
comprehensive briefing this morning.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers
to limit their statement to no more than five minutes to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to circulate the full text of their statement in
writing and deliver a condensed version in this
Chamber.

I now give the floor to the Permanent Observer of
Palestine.
