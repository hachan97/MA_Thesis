Mr. Olguin Cigarroa (Chile) (spoke in Spanish):
We thank Ambassador Roman Oyarzun Marchesi
for presenting the quarterly report of the work of the
Security Council Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1737 (2006) and for his excellent guidance
of its work.

Chile welcomes the agreement reached on 14 July
between Iran and the E3+3 group. Its implementation
will contribute to resolving the discrepancies with
regard to the scope and the future of Iran's nuclear
programme. We believe that the implementation and
verification ofthe agreement will preserve the integrity
of the multilateral non-proliferation regime and will
strengthen regional and global security.

The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons is the cornerstone of the nuclear disarmament
and non-proliferation regime and the implementation of
its three pillars - disarmament, non-proliferation and
the right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy - should
be balanced. Therefore, in this discussion, we should
not forget the need to make progress on the obligations
under article VI of the Treaty pertaining to nuclear
disarmament.

The establishment of internationally recognized
and verifiable nuclear weapon-free zones is a political
and legal commitment that brings us closer to the
universal ideal ofa society free of nuclear weapons. To
that end, we reiterate the importance of establishing a
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and it is
essential for the international community to contribute
to it. It is imperative that all actors implement this
agreement, as set out in resolution 2231 (2015), which
requires specific actions, but also responsibility and
moderation by the actors in their statements.

In conclusion, we reiterate that Chile, as a member
of the Council and as a member of the Board of
Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency,
will provide all necessary support for the effective and
smooth implementation of the agreement.
