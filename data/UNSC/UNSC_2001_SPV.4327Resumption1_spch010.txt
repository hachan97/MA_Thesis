Mr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I
would like at the outset to extend our thanks to you,
Mr. President, for organizing this open debate and for
affording us the opportunity to participate in this
meeting on the situation in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo and on the role we expect the United
Nations to play in this important phase of the peace
process in that country. I would also like to take this
opportunity to welcome the Foreign Minister of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo. Our two countries
have excellent relations that serve to unite us.

The delegation of Egypt has considered with
interest the report of the Secretary-General on the
Democratic Republic of the Congo. We have also
followed the activities of the Security Council mission
that visited the Great Lakes region in the second half of
May this year, as well as the valuable results that were
achieved during that mission. In this regard, my
delegation would like to make a number of specific
points that we believe need to be stressed.

First, the peace process in the Congo has lately
witnessed a number of consecutive steps that have
served to maintain the current momentum aimed at
implementing the Lusaka Agreement in both its
military and political components and at reaching a
final and comprehensive settlement of the conflict,
which has been tearing the Congo apart and draining
the energies of its neighbours for almost three years.
These steps have been reflected, inter alia, in the
continued respect by the parties of the ceasefire; in the
implementation of the disengagement plans between
their forces in the field; and in their agreement on the
principal framework that will govern the processes of
withdrawing all foreign forces from the country and of
disarming, demobilizing and reintegrating the armed
groups taking refuge on Congolese soil.

Secondly, and in the same vein, we now look to
the United Nations to intensify its efforts to support the
parties in implementing their commitments in
accordance with the Lusaka Agreement and the
relevant Security Council resolutions; to create an
environment conducive to the withdrawal of foreign
forces from the Congo and to ending the problems
posed by armed groups; and to establish the necessary
arrangements to restore the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of the Congo and address the security
concerns of its neighbours.

While we welcome the recommendation in the
Secretary-General's report on the revised concept of
operations for the United Nations Organization Mission
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC)
and on the deployment of additional troops, observers
and civilian personnel in the operation, we also hope
that the United Nations will proceed to prepare the
necessary plans to establish and deploy the third,
expanded phase of the Mission so that the period we
are about to enter - which we assume will be a
transitional one - will not be prolonged, and so that
the situation in the field will not become entrenched
where it currently stands, that is, lacking the
implementation of the specific steps needed to bring
the Lusaka Agreement to its desired conclusion.

Thirdly, while we are aware of the essential
prerequisites that must be met prior to the deployment
of phase III of the operation - at the forefront of
which is the provision by the parties of relevant
information on the numbers, locations and armaments
of their forces and those of the armed groups - we
would also like to stress that the United Nations must
be ready to address the challenges and risks it may face
in such an expanded operation, as it did in Sierra Leone
and, before that, in East Timor.

The Congo operation, like all other peacekeeping
operations, will by its nature and the nature of the
mission area be subject to a number of risks that cannot
be avoided. This, however, should not serve as a cause
for hesitation in the establishment of phase III, so long
as the two primary conditions that the Secretary-
General previously set for the deployment of United
Nations personnel in the Congo are met. Those
conditions are the provision of the necessary security
guarantees for MONUC personnel, and the
reaffirmation by the parties of their commitment to
respect and implement the Lusaka Agreement.

Fourthly, of course we cannot ask the United
Nations to undertake the primary role in the efforts to
resolve the conflict in the Congo without reaffirming
the responsibility that the parties themselves bear in
moving forward with the implementation of the Lusaka
Agreement and their responsibility to demonstrate the
necessary political will - not only to prepare detailed
plans for the withdrawal of foreign forces and the
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of the
armed groups, but also to implement what is agreed
upon in good faith and to resolve any differences that
may emerge between them within the Joint Military
Commission, the Political Committee and the inter-
Congolese dialogue under the facilitation of former
President Masire,

We would also like to take this opportunity to
encourage the parties to intensify their diplomatic
contacts at the highest level in a manner that strongly
drives the peace process forward and contributes to the
building of trust among them at this critical time. In
this regard, we welcome the steps being taken to
organize a meeting between Presidents Kabila and
Museveni, and we express the hope that those efforts
will extend to arranging similar direct contacts between
the leaderships in Kinshasa and Kigali.

Fifthly, we have also witnessed the increasing
importance given by the Security Council and the
Secretariat to the need to enhance the international
support that must accompany the implementation of the
Lusaka Agreement in resuscitating the Congolese
economy, rebuilding the infrastructure that was
destroyed by the conflict and rehabilitating the social,
educational and health institutions of the country.
While we welcome the ideas and initiatives that the
international community has begun to put forward in
that regard, we also express the hope that the
international community will prove its resolve to build
a genuine peace in the Congo and to eradicate the basic
causes that may prevent permanent peace and stability
from taking root in the country. It should do so by
generously contributing to the various programmes that
may be put in place so that they do not remain a dead
letter, as well as to end the suffering of the Congolese
people, who have been deprived for many decades of
enjoying the life of dignity and prosperity that they
deserve.

Sixthly, Egypt, will continue its active role in
contributing to the restoration of permanent peace in
the Congo and in the Great Lakes region - whether
through its bilateral contacts with the parties concerned
or within the Organization of African Unity. We will
also maintain our support for the courageous efforts of
the United Nations - represented by the Security
Council and the Secretary-General and his Special
Representative, Kamel Morjane - as well as our
contribution to MONUC, in which Egypt is proud to be
the largest provider of military observers among the 43
countries participating in the operation.

Before concluding, I would like to express our
deep concern at the ongoing events in the Central
African Republic following the failed coup attempt that
erupted in Bangui over two weeks ago. Perhaps those
events will strengthen the conviction of the United
Nations that the security and political situation in the
Great Lakes region continues to be extremely fragile
and that any undue haste in terminating or reducing the
presence of the United Nations in the region - or a
failure to confront the inter-twined problems that
continue to threaten international peace and security -
will only result in multiple consequences of a much
more serious nature than those already afflicting this
important and strategic region in the heart of the
African continent.
