Mr. De La Sabliere (France) (spoke in French):
The agreement reached yesterday between the
representatives of the families of UTA flight 772 and
the Qaddafi Foundation has allowed France not to
oppose the lifting of sanctions against Libya. France
welcomes this agreement, whereby conditions have
been established for an equitable settlement of this
painful matter, which, as members of the Council are
aware, involves people of 17 nationalities - not only
French, but also Africans, Americans and British
citizens, in particular. The agreement generated a joint
statement communicated to the members of the
Council.

The lifting of sanctions against Libya is an
important phase in the process of reintegrating that
country into the international community. This
normalization, which we encourage, presumes that
Libya will continue to make the necessary gestures
beyond the requirements for the lifting of sanctions.
France will be vigilant in ensuring that the agreement
reached between the families of the victims of the
bombing of the UTA flight and the Qaddafi Foundation
are rapidly implemented. This is the substance of the
position according to which France abstained in the
voting on the resolution just adopted by the Security
Council.
France urges Libya fully to comply with its
assumed commitments. It also calls on Libya to take
the measures expected of it on other issues that are
critical to the international community, in particular to
ensure an equitable settlement for victims of the attack
on the La Belle discotheque in Berlin in 1986. We also
intend to be vigilant with respect to all aspects
involving human rights and combating terrorism.

France thanks the members of the Council and the
families of the victims of the Lockerbie attack for the
understanding they have shown throughout these recent
weeks, particularly with respect to the latest
postponement of the voting on the text.
