Mr. Wittig (Germany): Germany voted in favour
of resolution 2046 (2012), which we also co-sponsored.
With the resolution, adopted under Chapter VII of the

United Nations Charter and imposing binding
obligations on the Sudan and South Sudan, the Council
is sending a clear and unequivocal message. Recent
months have brought the two countries to the brink of
all-out war. We have had to witness the events in Abyei,
the conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile, a dispute
about borders and oil, aerial bombardments, the
establishment of the Sudan Revolutionary Front and,
most recently, events in and around Heglig.

The Council's primary responsibility is to
maintain international peace and security. With the
adoption of resolution 2046 (2012), it is reacting in an
appropriate and timely way to a clear threat to that
international peace and security. Furthermore, the
Council is lending its support to the communique and
road map of the African Union, as the competent
regional organization. Germany strongly supports the
African Union's initiative and its leadership role in the
Sudan and South Sudan.

Resolution 2046 (2012) provides an opportunity
for those countries to return to peaceful, responsible
and mutually beneficial relations. It now falls to the
Governments in Khartoum and Juba to seize this
opportunity for the sake of their peoples. The Security
Council should and will closely monitor the situation
and the parties' compliance with the obligations
contained in the resolution.
