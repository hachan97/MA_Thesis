Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I have a rhetorical question for my British
colleague. What are his criteria for judging whether
my statement is substantive or an explanation of vote?
I consider it to be an explanation of vote and I would
be grateful for a ruling from you permitting me to
complete my statement, Mr. President.
