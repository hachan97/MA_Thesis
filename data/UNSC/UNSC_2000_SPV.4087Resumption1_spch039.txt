The President: May I make one brief comment. I
thank you very much, Ambassador, for your comments.
Just one brief clarification: you referred to a Security
Council resolution. This is a legitimate point, but it is not
our intention to have a resolution or a presidential

 

statement today. That is not the purpose of this particular
meeting. But your point, had this been the case, is well
taken.
