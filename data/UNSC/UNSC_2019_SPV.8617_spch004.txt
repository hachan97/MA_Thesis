Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): First of
all, may I begin by welcoming our colleague Mrs. Kelly
Craft to the Chamber.

Currently, the overall situation in the Central
African Republic is trending in a positive direction.
The Government of the Central African Republic is
committed to implementing the Political Agreement
for Peace and Reconciliation in the Central African
Republic. Positive progress in the implementation
of assessment criteria for the arms embargo has
been achieved.

Resolution 2488 (2019), which was just adopted,
will help strengthen the Central African Republic in
terms of peace, security and capacity-building and help
promote peace and stability in the country, which is
why China voted in its favour.

The resolution provides that the Security Council
will review the suitability of the current sanctions
measures in January 2020. In that regard, the Council
should listen more to the views of the Central African
Republic and respect the aspirations expressed by
its Government.

China's position on the issue of sanctions remains
consistent. Based on the actual situation on the ground,
China supports the wishes of the Government of the
Central African Republic for the early lifting of
sanctions and the arms embargo against that country.
