Mr. Pleuger (Germany): My delegation would
like first of all to thank Assistant Secretary-General
Kalomoh for his very comprehensive report. We also
appreciate very much the presence here of His
Excellency Mr. Ramos Horta. We listened with great
interest to his report and we hope that his
assessment- a brighter future and the possibility of
resolving the issues - proves to be right.

Like the Secretary-General, the European Union
and the Security Council itself, we condemned the
military coup in Guinea-Bissau, and we support the
African Union's stance against the seizure of power by
force. In this context, allow me to commend the
constructive role that the Economic Community of
West African States played in the aftermath of the
coup. We expect a prompt return to constitutional
order, and take note of the Military Committee's
announcement in this respect. We hope that the
ongoing electoral process will not be further damaged
and that elections will take place as soon as possible.
Together with our partners in the European
Union, we remain committed to working with the
United Nations, especially the ad hoc advisory group
on Guinea-Bissau of the Economic and Social Council,
as well as the United Nations Development Programme
and other United Nations agencies.

We feel that Guinea-Bissau is at a watershed and
that there is a real threat that we will see a failing State.
The economic situation is desperate. The International
Monetary Fund has withdrawn and World Bank
projects have been suspended. This situation has to be
remedied soon if the people of Guinea-Bissau are to be
provided with a future of security and prosperity. We
therefore feel that it is absolutely essential to restore
constitutional legality and democratic principles.
