Ms. French (United States of America): We are
pleased to join you, Madam President, in welcoming
the adoption of resolution 2417 (2018), the first to
recognize the clear links between armed conflict and
famine and the important role that the Council can play
in addressing this challenge. The text of the resolution
is one that we have been glad to sponsor. We would
like to thank the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Kuwait,
Sweden and Cote d'Ivoire, the members of the core
group, for their work in bringing it to fruition.

As we have said before, the connection between
conflict and hunger is undeniable. We are pleased that
today's resolution definitively resolves any remaining
doubt about that link. Today the Security Council has
unanimously demanded that parties to armed conflict
comply with their obligations under international law
and has called on all parties to protect infrastructure
critical to providing food to civilians. Today we set
forth a clear expectation that parties to conflict should
not take steps to perpetuate hunger and the suffering
of people.

Perhaps most importantly, the text makes it clear
that the Council must be prepared to respond in order
to prevent famine caused by conflict. In line with the
resolution, we encourage the Secretary-General to be
proactive in warning the Council about such conditions
so that it can respond. In that regard, we look forward
to more regular and continuous reporting on famine
conditions within the context of country-specific
situations. We have demonstrated here today that we
have the will to address conflict-related hunger, and we
look forward to working with members of the Council to
sustain our focus and attention to this important issue.
