Sir Emyr Jones Parry (United Kingdom): The
Security Council, in this vote, has demonstrated its
unanimous support for the N aivasha peace process and
for the statesmanlike role carried out by the parties. We
very much look forward to seeing further progress and
to that process coming to a successful conclusion. It is
right that the United Nations should put itself in a
position where it is able to give every support to that
process and to support the Government of the Sudan in
its efforts to bring an end to a conflict that has run for a
very long period.

So, progress, a special political mission and a
readiness to consider a peace support operation are
absolutely right at this stage. But, too, it is right that, in
adopting this resolution, we should look to see similar
progress throughout the Sudan, we should reinforce
again the efforts of the Government of that country,
which is responsible throughout the country for the
well-being of its citizens, and we should pay particular
attention to the situation in Darfur and ensure that all
of us and the humanitarian agencies play our part to
avert any humanitarian catastrophe in that area.
