Mr. Mansour (Palestine): At the outset, Sir,
allow me to congratulate you on the assumption by the
brotherly country of Ghana of the presidency of the
Security Council this month. We are certain that, under
your able leadership, the Council will spare no effort in
addressing the many critical issues that are before it at
this time.

I would also like to take this opportunity to
express our deep appreciation to the delegation and the
Permanent Representative of France for their wise and
capable leadership of the Council last month, during
which the Council repeatedly convened and held
consultations to address the dangerous crisis prevailing
in the Middle East, particularly with regard to the
situation in the occupied Palestinian territory, including
East Jerusalem, and the situation in Lebanon.

Today, with a fragile ceasefire in place and with
United Nations Member States assembling a force
under the supervision of the Security Council for the
purpose of bringing security and stability to southern
Lebanon, we are witnessing the Council - despite a
month's delay - carrying out its Charter responsibility
for the maintenance of international peace and security
by taking these immediate, necessary and concrete
measures.
I would also like to thank Under-Secretary-
General Ibrahim Gambari for his briefing.

In this regard, I would be remiss if I did not
express the continuing hopes and appeals of the
Palestinian people and their leadership that one day
soon the Council will also act in a concerted and
concrete manner to uphold its responsibilities towards
the question of Palestine by taking the measures
necessary to bring an end to the grievous violations and
breaches of international law, including international
humanitarian law, that continue to be committed by
Israel, the occupying Power, in the occupied
Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem.

The Council has the requisite authority to act, and
it is its fundamental duty to act appropriately to
address those crises and issues that pose a threat to
international peace and security and to exert every
effort in that regard for the protection of civilians in
armed conflict. The situation of the Palestinian people
under Israeli occupation in the occupied Palestinian
territory, including East Jerusalem, should be no
exception. Indeed, there is no doubt that the Arab-
Israeli conflict, the core of which has been the question
of Palestine and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, has
been the source of almost every threat to peace and
security in the Middle East for decades now; the loss
and suffering continue to mount to this day. We thus
reiterate our firm belief that the Council will ultimately
play its rightful role and uphold its resolutions vis-a-
vis the question of Palestine, leading towards the
ultimate resolution of this prolonged and tragic conflict
and of the Arab-Israeli conflict as a whole.

In this regard, I wish to highlight the fact that the
Arab Foreign Ministers, in their last three meetings, in
Cairo, Beirut and Cairo, respectively, determined, in
the light of the recent negative developments and the
grave deterioration in the region, to work seriously
towards bringing the issue of the situation in the
Middle East, including the question of Palestine, back
to the Security Council. Members will recall that
during the ministerial meeting of the Security Council
on the situation in Lebanon (S/PV.5511), the Foreign
Minister of Qatar officially announced that the Arab
countries would request a high-level meeting of the
Security Council in September to discuss the situation
in the Middle East, including the situation in the
occupied Palestinian territory, with a View to moving in
a practical way towards the implementation of the
Council's relevant resolutions designed to resolve this
conflict through the achievement of a final, just and
comprehensive peace settlement.

At this time, the Arab countries, Via the League
of Arab States, are in the midst of carrying out the
necessary consultations and groundwork aimed at
bolstering the potential for the success of this intended
exercise, and we are hopeful that there will be wide
support on the part of the international community in
this important endeavour.

The decision to return to the Security Council -
despite the Council's repeated inability to take the
necessary actions to address the situation in the Middle
East, particularly in the occupied Palestinian territory,
including East Jerusalem, and its failure to uphold its
numerous resolutions in this regard - has been taken
on the basis of a belief in the responsibilities and the
rightful role of the Council in international relations
with regard to peace and security and the upholding of
international law.

Moreover, it is clear that the peace process in
which we have been engaged for 15 years now,
beginning with the Madrid Conference in 1991, has not
fulfilled its stated goals, as it has been repeatedly
hampered by delays, stalemates, gross violations,
cycles of violence and major crises. Most regrettably,
this peace process, on its various tracks, has not
brought an end to Israel's occupation of the Palestinian
territory or of the Syrian Golan or of parts of southern
Lebanon. Our part of the world continues to suffer
Violence, loss and despair as a result of this continuing
military occupation and a never-ending series of
violations of international law, including military
aggression and attacks.

For Palestine, instead of the dramatic
improvement anticipated in the situation on the ground
and in the lives of the Palestinian people, the situation
in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East
Jerusalem, has steadily and gravely deteriorated during

those years in all aspects - political, security,
economic, social, and humanitarian. Israel, the
occupying Power, has continued - even during the

most productive years of the peace process - its
fervent, unlawful campaign of settler colonialism in the
occupied Palestinian territory, including in particular in
East Jerusalem, confiscating more and more
Palestinian land, building and expanding more
settlements, and more than doubling the number of its
settlers in the territory.

In addition, Israel has now nearly completed the
construction of a wall it has been building on
confiscated land in the occupied Palestinian territory,
including in and around East Jerusalem, that is
severing the territory into several isolated and walled
enclaves and cantons, destroying numerous
communities in their entirety, destroying the livelihood
of thousands of Palestinians and displacing thousands
more, and further entrenching Israel's illegal
settlements. The wall, along with the settlements and
Israel's hundreds of checkpoints and roadblocks, is
destroying the contiguity and territorial integrity of the
Palestinian territory, isolating occupied East Jerusalem
from the rest of the territory, devastating the
Palestinian economy, destroying the very fabric of
Palestinian society and taking us further away from the
possibility of actually achieving the two-State solution.

In addition, the Palestinian civilian population
under Israeli occupation continues to suffer declining
economic and social conditions as a result of Israel's
ongoing military campaign of aggression, as glaringly
witnessed in recent months, with its lethal and violent
assaults against the besieged population in the Gaza
Strip. That military campaign has involved, inter alia,
the occupying Power's deliberate use of excessive
force, resulting in the killing or injury of hundreds of
Palestinian civilians, including women and children;
the terrorizing of the population; the continuation of
extrajudicial killings; the vast and wanton destruction
of Vital infrastructure, properties and institutions of the
Palestinian Authority; the detention and imprisonment
of hundreds of Palestinian civilians - now totalling
more than 9,000 prisoners in Israeli jails; and the
collective punishment of the entire population.

All of this, in addition to the financial crisis
imposed on the Palestinian Authority in recent months
following the January 2006 elections, has caused a
dramatic decline in economic and social conditions and
has resulted in a grave humanitarian crisis in the
occupied Palestinian territory that continues to this day.

Since I addressed the Council on 21 July,
Palestine has sent eight letters to the President of the
Security Council detailing some of the grave breaches
committed by the aforementioned occupying Power.
Those letters also listed the names of the Palestinians
killed since the last time we met here in the Council.
The numbers are shocking. More than 105 people have
been killed, including 22 children, and over 600 have
been injured, many critically. In one single day during
that period, the Israeli occupying forces killed more
than 20 Palestinians, including two infants, a 4-year-
old baby girl and a 9-year-old girl, and injured more
than 80 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

On another front, more than 3,400 Palestinians
are now internally displaced and have sought shelter in
United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine
Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) installations, as a
result of the ongoing Israeli military aggression in the
Gaza Strip. This is due mainly to the fact that hundreds
of families living in neighbourhoods in Gaza were
forced to flee their homes in terror after receiving
threatening telephone calls from the Israeli occupying
forces telling them they had only a short time to
abandon their homes. There is no doubt that this new
tactic of psychological warfare has caused panic and
fear to spread among the Palestinian civilian
population, which already suffers from severe
psychological trauma as a result of Israel's brutal
occupation.

To highlight just one tragic incident, a 3-day-old
infant girl, Shahd Al-Eid, fell from her mother's arms
as the latter was fleeing, seeking refuge from a "pre-
warned" Israeli missile attack. The infant was later
pronounced dead as a result of internal bleeding and
bruises.

Indeed, it is a situation that continues to
deteriorate as a result of the occupying Power's
unlawful policies and practices, as we are witnessing in
its daily raids and deadly attacks in the occupied
Palestinian territory, particularly in Gaza; the
continued arrest and detention of Palestinians,
including numerous elected officials of the Palestinian
Authority; the continued closures and the imposition of
severe restrictions on freedom of movement; and the
continued destruction of property.

In that regard, it is important to note that the
elements of the recently vetoed draft resolution
concerning the situation in Gaza continue to be
relevant, for there has been no cessation of hostilities,
no withdrawal of the Israeli occupying forces to their
original positions outside Gaza, no release of detained
elected officials, and no repair of the vital
infrastructure destroyed by the occupying Power - all
necessary elements for paving the way for a
resumption of negotiations.

Overall, the prevailing situation in the occupied
Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, as a

result of Israel's illegal practices and measures, has
compounded not only the suffering and misery of the
Palestinian people but also their frustration,
desperation and anger, intensifying appeals by the
Palestinian people and by the Arab world as a whole
that real and immediate action to be taken to address
this ongoing injustice, which has continued for far too
long. Thus the decision by the Arab countries, at this
very critical juncture in the Middle East, to return to
the Security Council seeking redress is based on the
consensus Arab position that the issue of the Arab-
Israeli conflict, including the question of Palestine,
should revert to the Security Council and that the
Council should exercise its responsibility for the
maintenance of peace and security and assist the
parties to reach ajust and comprehensive solution.

In this regard, we reaffirm our commitment to the
two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
based on the relevant Security Council resolutions and
the terms of reference of the peace process, including
the principle of land for peace, the Arab Peace
Initiative and the Quartet road map. We therefore
reaffirm once again our strong hope that very soon the
Council will meet at a high level to undertake serious
and concrete actions towards the long-desired
achievement of a peaceful settlement of the question of
Palestine and the Arab-Israeli conflict as a whole and,
thus, the achievement of peace, security, coexistence
and prosperity for all the peoples of the Middle East
region.
