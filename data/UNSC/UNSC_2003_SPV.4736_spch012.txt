Mr. Tafrov (Bulgaria) (spoke in French): I would
like briefly to make two comments and to ask Mr.
Morris a question. First, I would like to thank him for
his eloquent statement, which I believe will prompt us
to reflect further on what actions the Security Council
can take.

That leads me to my second comment. I would
like to thank you in particular, Mr. President, for
having included today's meeting on our programme.
We now realize that the food situation in Southern
Africa and elsewhere in the continent has direct
implications for the security of Africa, while
security- or, rather, insecurity - has negative
implications for the food situation.

From that perspective, I believe that it is
extremely important for the Council in future to have
the knowledge and the capacity necessary to enable it
to integrate information and other factors relating to
food security into its approach to conflict in Africa. In
that regard, I wholeheartedly support the proposal of
Ambassador Valdes. I believe that the Council should
go even further; we should not be timid or worry about
going beyond our area of competence.

My question to Mr. Morris relates to Somalia. He
referred to the Horn of Africa. The question of Somalia
is on the Council's agenda; that country is experiencing
severe problems. What is the situation regarding food
security in that country in the Horn of Africa? What is
the attitude of the donor countries and of donors in
general towards Somalia?
