Mr. Orrenius Skau (Sweden): I too would like to
express our deepest condolences to the Government and
the people of Indonesia for the plane crash this morning.

The representative of Kuwait has already spoken
on behalf of Sweden as co-penholder, but after listening
to this morning's statements, I want to take the floor
just to highlight a few issues on which I hear a broad
convergence of positions. Fortunately, those areas also
seem to overlap with the asks put forward this morning
by the Under-Secretary-General.

First, I want to touch on respect for humanitarian
principles and international humanitarian law,
including access to Rukban and other hard-to-reach
areas, as well as protection, including in Deir ez-Zor
and, more generally of hospitals and other health-
care facilities and schools. That also relates to the
importance of independent needs assessments and
monitoring for principled humanitarian action, as the
Under-Secretary-General discussed this morning. The
second point I want to highlight is the implementation of
the Russian-Turkish agreement on the ceasefire in Idlib
in order to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe there.
Thirdly, in the light of the above we need to renew the
modalities in resolution 2165 (2014) on humanitarian
access, including for ensuring its continued delivery
to more than 3 million civilians in Idlib and across
northern Syria.

Finally, it seems that we all agree that the
humanitarian situation can be alleviated only if we
make progress on the political track, through a political
solution based on resolution 2254 (2015). We hope
that Council members can come together around these
points in a serious effort to alleviate the enormous
human suffering in Syria.
