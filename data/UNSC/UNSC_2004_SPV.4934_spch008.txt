Sir Emyr Jones Parry (United Kingdom): The
United Kingdom has consistently condemned
extrajudicial killings. We recognize Israel's right to
defend itself against terrorism, but it must act in
accordance with international law. The killing of
Sheikh Yassin was unlawful and will serve only to
perpetuate the vicious cycle of violence.

The United Kingdom has also repeatedly
condemned terrorist atrocities committed by terrorist
groups and which have caused hundreds of Israeli
civilian deaths. The Palestinians must take immediate
and effective action to stop the terrorism emanating
from the occupied Palestinian territories, in line with
their obligations under the road map.

On Monday, 22 March 2004, the United Kingdom
supported a European Union statement which
condemned the killing of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin but did
so in a balanced way. The United Kingdom abstained
on the resolution before us tonight because it was
unbalanced. It singled out one party as the perpetrator
of violence. It failed to condemn terrorist atrocities
against Israel and it limited its condemnation of
terrorist attacks to those against civilians.

Let me be clear, Sir, the United Kingdom would
have voted for this resolution if its proposers had
accepted an amendment reflecting the positions set out
by the European Union on 22 March. That amendment
would have replaced existing operative paragraph 2, by
another text. That text would have condemned terrorist
atrocities which have resulted in the deaths of hundreds
of Israelis, as well as all acts of violence and
destruction. That very reasonable amendment was not
accepted.

There will be no military solution to this conflict.
Our focus should be on moving the peace process
forward. The key is now for both sides to take
immediate steps to implement their obligations under
the road map and to refrain from actions which will
only serve to escalate violence in the region, leading to
yet more loss of life.
