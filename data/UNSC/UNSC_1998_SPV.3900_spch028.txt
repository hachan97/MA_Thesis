Mr. Kolby (Norway): Norway is concerned about the
recent approval by the Israeli Government of plans which
would alter the demographic balance in the Jerusalem area.
This new Israeli plan is not conducive to creating trust
between the parties in the Middle East peace process, which
is essential to move the process out of the present
stalemate. On the contrary, the decision might increase the
tension between the parties, as it might contribute to pre-
empting the outcome of the final status talks.

Israel should recognize the applicability of the Fourth
Geneva Convention - both de facto and de jure - to the
occupied Palestinian territory, including Jerusalem, and to

 

other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, and
should comply fully with its provisions.

Norway appeals to the parties to respect the letter
and the spirit of the Oslo accords. Norway urges the
parties to the peace process to intensify their bilateral
consultations at the highest possible level, to implement
the outstanding issues in the Interim Agreements,
including the redeployment on the West Bank, and to
move as fast as possible to the final status negotiations.
