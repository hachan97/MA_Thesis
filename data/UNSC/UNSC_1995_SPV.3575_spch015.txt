The President: I thank the representative of Bosnia
and Herzegovina for her kind words addressed to me.

I should like to inform the Council that I have just
received a letter from the representative of Pakistan in
which he requests to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the discussion without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Kamal
(Pakistan) took the place reserved for him at the
side of the Council Chamber.

The President: The next speaker is the
representative of Croatia. I invite him to take a place at
the Council table and to make his statement.
