Mr. Ngoh Ngoh (Cameroon) (spoke in French): I
will be brief. I, too, wish to thank Mr. Oshima for his
detailed briefing and the very useful information he has
just given us on the situation in Angola. The signature
of a Memorandum of Understanding between the
Government of Angola and UNITA turns a new page in
the history of this country, which has been traumatized
by a long fratricidal war.

But despite the cessation of hostilities, Angola is
facing a very disturbing humanitarian situation. We
would like to congratulate the Government on its
efforts at facing up to it. We also congratulate the
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
and other humanitarian organizations on the ground for
the work they are doing. The magnitude of the needs of
the Angolan people indeed calls for additional efforts
from the Government and the international community.
The resettlement of internally displaced persons, the
rehabilitation of infrastructure and the situation of
children are issues that, in the view of my delegation,
should draw priority attention.

Another issue that was mentioned by several
delegations is mine clearance. This is a crucial issue. I
would like Mr. Oshima to give us some information
about possible projects to deal with landmines and
rehabilitate arable land. We support the
recommendations that he has just made in his report.
Like other delegations, we eagerly await the report that
will be submitted following Ambassador Gambari's
visit to Angola.
