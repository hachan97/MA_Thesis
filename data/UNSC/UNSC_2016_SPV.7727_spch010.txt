Mr. Rycroft (United Kingdom): Like others, allow
me to begin by expressing my sincere condolences to
the Government and people of Turkey for the appalling
attack on Istanbul International Airport.

Very briefly, with regard to Mali, I welcome

the unanimous adoption of resolution 2295 (2016).
It provides the United Nations Multidimensional
Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA)
with the capabilities and terms to carry out its mission
successfully. As well as providing additional troops,
the resolution clearly states that peacekeepers will take
robust action to defend themselves against attacks from
groups that are intent on disrupting the Agreement
on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali. Therefore, this
mandate strengthens MINUSMA's ability to tackle
asymmetrical threats, for example by providing an
enhanced intelligence capability for the Mission.
The mandate is fully in line with the principles of
peacekeeping. The Mission is authorized to take action
in self-defence and in defence of the mandate.

I pay tribute to the peacekeepers risking their
lives in Mali. This mandate demonstrates the shared
commitment of the Council to help create a more stable
and secure Mali. The Government of Mali and northern
signatory groups must now use this opportunity to
implement the terms of the Peace Agreement without
delay.
