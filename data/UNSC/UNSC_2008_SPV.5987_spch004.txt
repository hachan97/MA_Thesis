Mr. Natalegawa (Indonesia): Allow me first of
all to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the
presidency of the Council for this month and also to
express our profound appreciation to Ambassador
Kafando and his able delegation for their sterling
stewardship of the Council last month.

My delegation's favourable vote on resolution
1838 (2008) was based on a number of considerations.
Our support reflects our deep concern at the
intensifying problem of piracy in the waters off the
coast of Somalia, which threatens the transportation of
humanitarian assistance into Somalia as well as the
security of international navigation in the area.

That said, however, we do not see piracy off the
coast of Somalia as a stand-alone problem. Rather, it is
an extension of the continuing political instability and
lawlessness in Somalia itself. Resolution 1838 (2008)
is an attempt to gather support to address a maritime
menace, but the larger problem remains outstanding
and the resolution is not intended to be a substitute for
larger efforts to help Somalia deal with its conflicts.

We are also in favour of the resolution as we
support the appeal for a greater international
contribution and more cooperation in protecting
humanitarian convoys for Somalia and in repressing
piracy and armed robbery at sea in conformity with
international law, in particular the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea and Security
Council resolution 1816 (2008). Those instruments are
both necessary and adequate to address that menace.

Finally, it is our view that resolution 1838 (2008),
like resolution 1816 (2008) before it, applies only to
the situation in Somalia. Those resolutions clearly state
that they shall not affect the rights, obligations or
responsibilities of Member States under international
law and shall not be considered as establishing
customary international law.
