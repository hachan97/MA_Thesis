Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 2381
overseeing the ceasefire between the Colombian
Government and the Eje'rcito de Liberacion Nacional
(ELN). Recently, the Colombian Government and the
ELN reached a temporary ceasefire agreement, which
representss major progress in the Colombian peace
process. China congratulates and commends all parties
for their efforts, including the Colombian Government.

Since the Colombian Government reached the
ceasefire agreement and the Final Agreement for
Ending the Conflict and Building a Stable and Lasting
Peace with the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias
de Colombia last year, the Colombian peace process
has continued to experience new progress, resulting
in positive momentum in support of the dialogue for
peace between the Colombian Government and the
ELN, which has created conditions conducive to the
early realization of comprehensive sustainable peace
and stability in Colombia.

The United Nations Verification Mission in
Colombia started its work officially not long ago,
and the adoption of resolution 2381 (2017) further
strengthens its mandate. The Verification Mission,
while advancing the implementation of the peace
agreement, will oversee the ceasefire between the
Colombian Government and the ELN. China hopes
that the Secretariat will finalize its preparation work
as soon as possible. In helping the Verification Mission
to successfully carry out its mandate, we also hope that
on the basis of respect for sovereignty, independence
and the territorial integrity of Colombia, the Mission
will strengthen communications with the Colombian
Government and conduct good internal coordination
work, while ensuring the comprehensive implementation
of the mandate so as to provide constructive help to the
greater outcome of the peace process in Colombia.
