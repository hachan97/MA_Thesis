Mr. Duclos (France) (spoke in French): France
welcomes the unanimous adoption of the resolution.
The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL) makes an indispensable contribution to
stability and security in the region. The persistence of
violent incidents and violations along the length of the
Blue Line underlines the importance of UNIFIL's
presence on the ground.

That resurgence of violence has grave
consequences, including, recently, the death of a
French officer serving the United Nations Truce
Supervision Organization.

We condemn the use of violence. We call on the
parties to exercise the utmost restraint. We also
condemn all violations of the Blue Line, whether by
land or by air. It is the responsibility of the parties to
take the necessary measures to ensure respect for the
Blue Line in its entirety and to prevent all violations.
The Blue Line remains the agreed reference for the
international community.

To that end, and in conformity with the constant
demands of the Security Council, Lebanon must
re-establish its authority in the south, in particular by
deploying its armed forces and disarming the militias.
At a time when there are encouraging prospects with
regard to resuming the peace process in the Middle
East, everything must be done to move towards
stability in the region.
