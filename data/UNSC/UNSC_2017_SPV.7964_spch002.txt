Mr. Wilson (United Kingdom): As we all know,
Libya continues to suffer from political instability.
A comprehensive political solution, along with
development and capacity-building, is urgently needed
to improve its stability. But in the meantime, illegal
arms smuggling into Libya is fuelling and prolonging
its internal conflict, and that instability affects both
the region and others farther afield. As the author of
resolution 2357 (2017), we are therefore pleased that the
Council has remained united on the issue of renewing
the measures we put in place last year for a further
12 months, in order to help stop illegal arms entering
Libya by sea. It demonstrates that the international
community is serious about improving Libya's security.

I also want to pay tribute to Operation Sophia ofthe
European Union (EU). Over the past year, assets and
personnel from EU member States have worked to deter
those who wish to smuggle illegal arms into Libya, and
Sophia is so far the only operation that has implemented
such measures. Operation Sophia's efforts to deter and
reduce the flow of arms into Libya have provided an
important space for dialogue between the Government
of National Accord and other Libyan actors. The
recent clashes in Libya have only emphasized the
importance of the international community's support
for dialogue between Libyan stakeholders towards the
political solution that is essential to achieving a more
stable Libya. Today's resolution is an important part of
that support.
