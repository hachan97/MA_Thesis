Mr. Moncada (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): It is an honour for the Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela to take the floor on behalf of the
Movement of Non-Aligned countries at this quarterly
open debate on a topic to which we have historically
attached particular importance 4 the situation in the
Middle East, including the Palestinian question.

First of all, we would like to convey our gratitude
to Mr. Miroslav Jenca, Assistant Secretary-General for
Political Affairs, for his valuable briefing.

Against the backdrop of the ongoing critical situation
and diminishing prospects for peace, the Non-Aligned
Movement takes this opportunity to reaffirm its
abiding solidarity with the Palestinian people and its
unwavering support for their just cause, while renewing
its commitment to further strengthen and coordinate
efforts to promote a just, lasting, comprehensive and
peaceful solution to the Palestinian question in all its
aspects, including the achievement of justice and the
rights of the Palestinian people - an objective that
remains a priority on the Movement's agenda.

The principled positions of the Movement in
relation to the question of Palestine were clearly
reaffirmed almost a month ago, on 19 September,
when the Ministerial Committee of the Non-Aligned
Movement on Palestine issued a political declaration
of support and solidarity with the Palestinian people,
which was later endorsed by consensus by the Ministers
for Foreign Affairs of the Movement.

Moreover, the member States of the Movement
reaffirm that the ongoing Israeli occupation and the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict as a whole continue to pose a
serious threat to international peace and security, which
requires urgent attention and a solution, in accordance
with international law, the relevant United Nations
resolutions and, of course, the Charter of the United
Nations itself. In that regard, the Movement stands
ready to contribute to the achievement ofajust, lasting
and peaceful solution, and we call for the intensification
of international and regional efforts in support of that
goal, while recalling the responsibilities of the Security
Council and of the General Assembly in that regard, as
was most recently reaffirmed in resolution 2334 (2016),
which was wholeheartedly welcomed and supported by
the Movement.

We believe that the resolution provides the
most viable path, setting forth the requirements and
parameters for a just solution that would safeguard
the two-State solution along the 1967 lines and create
the necessary conditions to end the occupation,
justly resolve the conflict in all its aspects and make
Palestinian-Israeli peace and security a reality. In
addition, the Movement continues to call for the
resolution to be fully respected and implemented,
while stressing that it remains central to redressing
the situation on the ground, de-escalating tensions and
fostering an appropriate environment for the pursuit
of peace. In that regard, we reiterate the need for a
substantive written report to be presented regarding the
implementation of the resolution, in order to support
the Council's duties and ensure proper documentation
of the implementation of the resolution's provisions,
especially in the light of Israel's continued disregard
of the Security Council and its violation of its legally
binding resolutions.

The Non-Aligned Movement expresses its grave
concern regarding recent developments in the occupied
Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem. In
particular, the Movement is concerned about the
ongoing, escalating policies and measures by Israel,
the occupying Power, aimed at expanding its illegal
settlements campaign and to continue to consolidate
its half-century of invasion and occupation of
Palestinian land and its violation of the rights of the
Palestinian people.

Rather than ceasing its violations, reversing the
negative trends on the ground and demonstrating its
commitment to the two-State solution on the basis
of the pre-1967 lines, as demanded by the Security
Council and the international community as a whole,
Israel continues to act with contempt for the Council
and in breach of its legal obligations. In that regard,
member States of the Movement strongly condemn the
recent provocative decisions of Israel, the occupying
Power, to proceed with its settlement activities in grave
breach of international law and of the relevant United
Nations resolutions, including resolution 2334 (2016).
Moreover, we are alarmed by and deeply deplore the
flagrant contempt of Israel, the occupying Power, for
the unequivocal decision by the Security Council in that
regard, which clearly reaffirmed that Israel's settlement
activities have no legal validity and that they constitute
a flagrant violation of international law. That resolution
also calls on Israel to immediately and completely cease
all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian
territory, including East Jerusalem, and to fully respect
all of its legal obligations, including under the Fourth
Geneva Convention.

We must also once again warn of the high risk for
further deterioration and destabilization, as witnessed
recently in occupied East Jerusalem due to provocative
and illegal Israeli actions in the Old City and at
Haram Al-Sharif, which houses the Al-Aqsa Mosque,
including attempts to undermine the historic status quo
at the holy site, which dramatically raised tensions and
inflamed religious sensitivities. Those practices must
stop in order, among other things, to ensure Palestinian
freedom of access and worship, as well as to ensure full
respect for the sanctity of all the holy sites and to avert
any further destabilization.

The situation in Gaza continues to elicit great
concern for the Movement, in particular the grave
humanitarian situation. In that regard, the Movement
reiterates its call for the complete lifting of the more
than lO-year-long Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip,
while also stressing that the crisis in Gaza must
be comprehensively addressed in accordance with
international law, including humanitarian law and
human rights law, and in accordance with the relevant
United Nations resolutions in the context of the overall
situation of the continuation of the illegitimate,
belligerent Israeli foreign occupation of Palestinian
territory since 1967, including East Jerusalem, and
of the unequivocal calls for an end to a half-century
of occupation.

Moreover, the Non-Aligned Movement welcomes
recent steps being taken towards Palestinian
reconciliation, including the signing of the unity
agreement between the Palestinian Authority and
Hamas on 12 October, and expresses its full and resolute
support for efforts aimed at ensuring Palestinian unity
and the effective functioning of a Palestinian national
consensus government in Gaza.

Next month will mark another sombre anniversary
for the question of Palestine: the seventieth anniversary
of the General Assembly's decision to split Mandated
Palestine via its adoption of resolution 181 (II), of
29 November 1947. In that regard, the member States of
the Movement reiterate their calls for the intensification
of international efforts aimed at achieving, without
further delay, an end to the Israeli occupation that began
in 1967 and ajust, lasting, comprehensive and peaceful
solution, while reiterating the Movement's readiness to
cooperate and support all relevant efforts in line with
the decisions taken during the seventeenth Summit of
the Non-Aligned Movement on Margarita Island.

The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries reaffirms
that all measures and actions taken by Israel, the
occupying Power, such as its illegal decision of
14 December 1981, which purports to alter the legal,
geographical and demographic status of the occupied
Syrian Golan and its institutional structure, in addition
to Israel's measures to apply its jurisdiction and
administration there, are null and void and have no
legal effect. In that regard, in line with our principled
position, we demand once again that Israel abide by
resolution 497 (1981) and withdraw fully from the
occupied Syrian Golan to the lines of 4 June 1967, in
accordance with resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).

In addition member States of the Movement
emphasize the need for Israel to withdraw from all
Lebanese territories, including the Sheba'a farms land,
the Kfar Shuba Hills and the Lebanese part of Ghajar
Village, up until behind the Blue Line, in accordance
with the relevant international resolutions, and in
particular resolution 1701 (2006).

In conclusion, the Movement of Non-Aligned
Countries avails itself of this opportunity to reiterate
its appeal to the States Members of the Organization
to redouble current efforts aimed at overcoming the
continued financial shortfalls of the United Nations
Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the
Near East with a view to ensuring adequate, sufficient,
predictable and sustained funding for the Agency for
the duration of its mandate so it can fully meet the
needs of Palestinian refugees and thereby fulfil is
humanitarian mission. In that regard, we underscore
the need to continue providing political, economic
and humanitarian support to assist the Palestinian
people and to bolster their resilience and efforts aimed
at achieving their legitimate national aspirations,
including their inalienable right to self-determination
and freedom in their independent State of Palestine,
with East Jerusalem as its capital.
