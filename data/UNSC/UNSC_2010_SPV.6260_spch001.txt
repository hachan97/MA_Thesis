The President (spoke in Chinese): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Nepal, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Acharya
(Nepal) took a seat at the Council table.

The President (spoke in Chinese): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Ms. Karin Landgren,
Representative of the Secretary-General and head of
the United Nations Mission in Nepal.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Ms. Landgren to take a seat at the
Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2010/ 17, which contains the report of
the Secretary-General on the request of Nepal for
United Nations assistance in support of its peace
process. I should also like to draw the attention of
members of the Council to document S/2010/25, which
2

contains a letter dated 14 January 2010 from the
Secretary-General addressed to the President of the
Security Council.

At this meeting the Council will hear a briefing
by Ms. Karin Landgren, to whom I now give the floor.
