Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation has traditionally
supported the activities of the International Security
Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, as well as
2

extend its mandate for an additional period of 12
months. The International Security Assistance Force is
combating the terrorist threat from the Taliban,
Al-Qaida and other extremists, and is making an
important contribution to stabilizing the situation in
Afghanistan. We look forward to the further
enhancement of the effectiveness of those efforts.

However, I should like to note that, during the
process of reaching agreement on the draft resolution,
no clarity was provided with regard to the proposed
new wording pertaining to the coalition Force's
maritime interception component, which has not
appeared in any of the Security Council's previous
resolutions on Afghanistan. As the Security Council is
aware, the activities of the coalition are carried out
outside the context of the United Nations, and the
Council has not been informed in detail about them.
We believe that the maritime component is necessary
solely to combat terrorism in Afghanistan and should
not be used for other purposes.

On the basis of those considerations, during the
final stage of the Council's work, the Russian
Federation proposed including in the draft resolution
wording that has already been tested by the Security
Council. Unfortunately, our proposals were not duly
discussed. The draft resolution was hastily put to the
vote, although there is still a month remaining to
ISAF's current mandate. That is not in keeping with the
Council's normal working practices. The Russian
Federation will therefore not be able to support the
draft resolution.

The unity of the Security Council has been
sacrificed for the sake of undue haste.
