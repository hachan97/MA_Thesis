Mr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): Viet Nam is
deeply concerned about the situation in the area of
conflict of South Ossetia as tensions in the region are
rising. We especially regret last week's and other
incidents, which led to numerous fatalities, injuries and
displacements. My delegation considers that force
cannot resolve the conflict, but rather will destroy all
hope of finding solutions. In that spirit, we call on both
Georgia and South Ossetia to exercise restraint, put an
immediate end to the military activities, strictly
observe the agreement on the non-resumption of
hostilities and renew direct talks towards a
comprehensive and durable solution to the situation
and towards preventing its deterioration.

My delegation commends and supports Russia's
efforts to de-escalate the tension by sending envoys to
the region to restart the negotiating process aimed at
finding a mutually acceptable and peaceful solution to
the conflict. We believe that such initiatives are
necessary to end the mounting violence and to bring
the situation back under control.
