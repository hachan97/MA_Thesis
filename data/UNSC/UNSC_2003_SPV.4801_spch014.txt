Mr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): My delegation welcomes the adoption by
consensus of the draft resolution on the Western
Sahara. Any lack of agreement between Arab parties is
of great concern to Syria. Syria always makes every
possible effort to resolve differences between Arab
parties. We hope that the consensus resolution that we
have adopted will bring the parties together with a
View to achieving a peaceful resolution of the question
of Western Sahara.

We would like to thank the Secretary-General and
express appreciation for his efforts and those of his
Personal Envoy. We wish them every success in their
endeavours in the near future.
