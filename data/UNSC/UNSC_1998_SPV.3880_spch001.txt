The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them a letter
dated 9 April 1998 from the Secretary-General addressed to
the President of the Security Council, transmitting the fifth
consolidated report of the Director General of the
International Atomic Energy Agency, submitted under
paragraph 16 of Security Council resolution 1051 (1996),
document S/1998/312; and a note by the Secretary-General,
transmitting the fifth consolidated report of the Executive
Chairman of the Special Commission established by the
Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 9 (b) (i) of
Security Council resolution 687 (1991), submitted under
paragraph 16 of Security Council resolution 1051 (1996),
document S/1998/332.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to the following other documents: S/ 1998/ 176
and S/1998/308, letters dated 19 February and 8 April 1998,
respectively, from the Executive Chairman of the Special
Commission established by the Secretary-General pursuant
to paragraph 9 (b) (i) of Security Council resolution 687
(1991) addressed to the President of the Security Council.

Following consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council has reviewed the report of
16 April 1998 from the Executive Chairman of the
United Nations Special Commission (S/1998/332) and
the report of 9 April 1998 from the Director General
of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
(S/1998/312). The Council welcomes the improved
access provided to the Special Commission and the

IAEA by the Government of Iraq following the
signature of the Memorandum of Understanding by
the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq and the Secretary-
General on 23 February 1998 (S/1998/166) and the
adoption of its resolution 1154 (1998) of
2 March 1998. The Council calls for continued
implementation of the Memorandum of
Understanding.

"The Security Council expresses the hope that
the agreement by the Government of Iraq to fulfil its
obligation to provide immediate, unconditional, and
unrestricted access to the Special Commission and
the IAEA will reflect a new Iraqi spirit with regard
to providing accurate and detailed information in all
areas of concern to the Special Commission and the
IAEA as required by the relevant resolutions.

"The Security Council expresses its concern
that the most recent reports of the Special
Commission, including the reports of the technical
evaluation meetings (S/1998/176 and S/1998/308),
indicate that Iraq has not provided full disclosure in
a number of critical areas, in spite of repeated
requests from the Special Commission, and calls
upon Iraq to do so. The Council encourages the
Special Commission to continue its efforts to
improve its effectiveness and efficiency and looks
forward to a technical meeting of the members of
the Council with the Executive Chairman of the
Special Commission as a follow-up to the review of
sanctions held by the Council on 27 April 1998.

"The Security Council notes that the Special
Commission and the IAEA must discharge their
mandates as defined under resolutions 687 (1991) of
3 April 1991 and 707 (1991) of 15 August 1991
with full Iraqi cooperation in all areas, including
fulfilment by Iraq of its obligation to provide full,
final and complete declarations of all aspects of its
prohibited programmes for weapons of mass
destruction and missiles.

"The Security Council notes that the
investigations by the IAEA over the past several
years have yielded a technically coherent picture of
Iraq's clandestine nuclear programme, although Iraq
has not supplied full responses to all of the questions
and concerns of the IAEA, including those specified
in paragraphs 24 and 27 of the report of the Director
General of 9 April 1998.

 

"The Council affirms its intention, given the
progress of the IAEA, and in line with paragraphs 12
and 13 of resolution 687 (1991), to agree in a
resolution that the IAEA dedicate its resources to
implement the ongoing monitoring and verification
activities of the IAEA under resolution 715 (1991) of
11 October 1991, upon receipt of a report from the
Director General of the IAEA stating that the
necessary technical and substantive clarifications have
been made, including provision by Iraq of the
necessary responses to all IAEA questions and
concerns, in order to permit full implementation of the
ongoing monitoring and verification plan approved by
resolution 715 (1991). In this regard, the Council
requests the Director General of the IAEA to provide
this information in his report due on 11 October 1998
and to submit a status report by the end of July 1998
for possible action at that time.

"The Security Council acknowledges that the
IAEA is focusing most of its resources on the
implementation and strengthening of its activities
under the ongoing monitoring and verification plan.
The Council notes that, within the framework of its
ongoing monitoring and verification responsibilities,
the IAEA will continue to exercise its right to
investigate any aspect of Iraq's clandestine nuclear
programme, in particular through the follow-up of
any new information developed by the IAEA or
provided by Member States, and to destroy, remove
or render harmless any prohibited items discovered
through such investigations falling under resolutions
687 (1991) and 707 (1991) in conformity with the
IAEA's ongoing monitoring and verification plan
approved by resolution 715 (1991)."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/1998/11.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 12.25 pm.
