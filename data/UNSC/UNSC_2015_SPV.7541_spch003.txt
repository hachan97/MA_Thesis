Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation voted in favour
of the United Kingdom's resolution 2244 (2015), on
Somalia and Eritrea, as for us and other members of the
Security Council the imperative is to swiftly achieve
peace and stability in the countries of the Horn of
Africa. However, we continue to have concerns about
the intrusive nature of a number of provisions of the
resolution that effectively undermine the principle of
State sovereignty.

I should also point out that, as was the case last
year, certain provisions of this resolution are based on
conclusions in the final report of the Monitoring Group
Committee pursuant to resolutions 751 (1992) and 1907
(2009) that have not been substantiated by facts. Let me
reiterate that experts should not go beyond the purview
of their mandate during the preparation of their
documents. They must be guided solely by verified
facts, and not build their conclusions on the basis of
conjectures and unfounded accusations.

We are forced to reiterate that the use of sanctions is
an exceptional and rarely effective method. Resolving
conflicts must take place exclusively through political
and diplomatic means, on the basis of mutual respect
and multifaceted dialogue among all the States in the
region.
