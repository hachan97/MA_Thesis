Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
strongly condemns the shootings in Christchurch,
New Zealand. We mourn the victims and would like
to express our deep condolences to the families of the
victims and our sympathy to the injured.

Since the second half of last year, when the
Government of South Sudan and the major opposition
signed the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution
of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan, the
situation there has continued to improve. A ceasefire
has been implemented in most areas, and internally
displaced persons and refugees in some areas have
begun to return home. China welcomes all of this.

Since its deployment, the United Nations Mission
in South Sudan (UNMISS) has played an important role
in maintaining peace and stability in South Sudan. The
international community should continue to support the
Mission in carrying out its mandate. China therefore
voted in favour of resolution 2459 (2019), which the
Council has just adopted. At the same time, we believe
that the text of the resolution still needs improvement
on the following points. First, the international
community, especially the Security Council, should
fully acknowledge the importance and positive
significance of the Revitalized Agreement. UNMISS
should focus on facilitating the implementation of the
Agreement in order to help sustain the current positive
momentum in South Sudan. Secondly, with regard
to the issue of improving the Mission's performance,
the Secretariat and the Mission's military, police and
civilian components should work together to draw
on past experience in order to improve the Mission's
existing performance evaluation system. The relevant
work should include the full participation of the troop-
contributing countries, with a view to enabling the
Mission to carry out its functions better.

China is ready to continue to play a constructive
role in achieving peace, stability and development in
South Sudan.
