The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2007/240, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by the United States of
America. Members also have before them document
S/2007/213, the report of the Secretary-General on the
Sudan.

I also wish to draw the attention of the members
of the Council to document 8/2007/212, which
contains the text of a letter dated 17 April 2007 from
the President of the Security Council addressed to the
Secretary-General.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on the representative of Qatar,
who wishes to make a statement before the voting.
