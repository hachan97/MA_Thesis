Mr. Gaspar Martins (Angola): Angola voted in
favour of resolution 2249 (2015) - submitted by France
in connection with the terrorist attacks perpetrated by
the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), also
known as Daesh - in the expectation that it is an
important step in the fight against terrorism and for the
building for the indispensible global coalition needed if
we are to win the war against terrorism.

We join the other members of the Security Council
in condemning this terrorist movement, which, as
the resolution states, constitutes an unprecedented
to international peace and security. We express our
deep sympathy and condolences to the victims and the
families of the heinous crimes recently committed by
terrorists.

The complete eradication of ISIL/Daesh, as well
as Boko Haram, Al-Shabaab and other terrorist groups
designated by the Security Council, is a top priority for
the international community. International terrorism has
been showing a highly dangerous capacity to spread its
violent extremist ideology through terrorist acts, gross
systematic attacks against innocent civilians, violations
of human rights and intolerance and hatred of the other
for being different on cultural, religious or ethnic
grounds. In addition to recruiting terrorist fighters, the
heinous crimes committed by ISIL/Daesh also include
the destruction of cultural heritage and trafficking in
natural resources and cultural artefacts - including
crimes at a scale rarely seen since the Second World
War.

As things stand now, with the deadly danger of
terrorism as a real menace to international peace and
security and to the very survival of some of the most
affected countries, it is high time for the international
community and the main international players to put
aside our differences, national egoism and arrogance and
work decidedly to build a global coalition to fight and
eradicate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,
as called for by international public opinion. It is our
hope that the adoption of resolution 2249 (2015), in the
wake of this deadly concerted terrorist act, will serve
as a wake-up call for a radical change in attitude by the
world's main players.
