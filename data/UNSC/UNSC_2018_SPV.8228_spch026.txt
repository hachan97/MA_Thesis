Mr. Skoog (Sweden): We want swift and resolute
action today, and we want the Security Council to
shoulder its collective responsibility. But I am not sure
that we have exhausted all the avenues that could get
us there, nor am I sure that voting on this new Russian
draft resolution (S/2018/322) will get us there either.
We feel that we are at a very fragile stage of Council
deliberations right now, and we need to reflect carefully
on the way forward to ensure that we do not jump
into further paralysis, with consequences that will be
difficult to defend or repair.

That is why I would like to ask you, Mr. President,
to suspend the meeting right here and now so that
we can all move into consultations and carefully and
collectively reflect on the next step.
