Mr. Delattre (France) (spoke in French): France
welcomes the adoption of resolution 2410 (2018),
renewing the mandate of the United Nations Mission
in Support of Justice in Haiti (MINUJUSTH) for one
year and setting the stage for its withdrawal with
a view to a transition in October 2019. Until then,
MINUJUSTH will pursue its mandate, based on three
pillars: strengthening the Haitian National Police,
consolidating the rule oflaw and monitoring the human
rights situation. We regret that the Mission did not
receive the Council's unanimous consent, despite the
fact that we all support the objective of a stable and
prosperous Haiti.

MINUJUSTH's tasks regarding the
professionalization ofjustice and the training of police
represent the foundations of long-term stability and the
necessary conditions for the economic development
of Haiti. We encourage the Haitian authorities to
take advantage of this United Nations tool in order
to consolidate the country's stability and improve the
people's well-being. The prospect of meeting an exit
strategy by October 2019 should not paralyse us or affect
the remarkable work of men and women currently on the
ground. The benchmarks identified by the Secretary-
General, including those on the protection of the rights
of Haitian citizens, are a compass for guiding the work
of MINUJUSTH and the Haitian authorities. It is now
incumbent upon the Haitian State to take ownership of
those objectives in order to ensure the enduring success
of its cooperation with the United Nations. Haiti can
count upon the full support of France in that endeavour.
