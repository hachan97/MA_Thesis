The President (spoke in French): Before calling
on the first speaker inscribed on my list, I should like
to inform members of the Council that I intend to
adhere to the timetable, that is to say, to begin the
meeting at 10 am. and to suspend it at 1 p.m., to
resume at 3 p.m. and suspend at 6 p.m. I count on the
cooperation of speakers in order to be able to begin
promptly and be able to hear all speakers.

I should also like to inform the Council that I
have received a letter from the representative of
Mauritania, in which he requests to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Ould
Deddach (Mauritania) took the seat reserved for
him at the side of the Council Chamber

The President (spoke in French): The next
speaker on my list is the representative of Morocco. I
invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to
make his statement.
