Mr. Cai Weiming (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
thank Prosecutor Bensouda for her briefing.

Recently, the situation in Darfur has been generally
calm with some ups and downs. The Sudanese
Government has stepped up its preparations for the
national dialogue, actively implemented the Darfur
Peace Agreement, promoted communal reconciliation
and combated crimes. It has taken some positive steps
with regard to humanitarian access. China welcomes that
and supports the efforts by the Sudanese Government
in advancing the political process and reconciliation.

China is deeply concerned about the attacks against
civilians, United Nations peacekeepers and international
humanitarian relief workers that took place in Darfur.
We are deeply troubled by the increasing number of
internally displaced persons. We call on all armed rebel
groups to stop the violence immediately and take part
in the political process.

The United Nations plays an important role in
promoting a solution to the Darfur problem. China
supports and encourages dialogue and cooperation
between the United Nations and the Sudanese
Government and supports the important role of the
African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in
Darfur in maintaining peace and stability in Darfur.

The question of Darfur is very complicated, as it
involves the political process, security and stability,
development and reconstruction, humanitarian
assistance and judicial justice. Among those aspects,
the political process is the most crucial. Only when
sustained progress in the political process is made, can
Darfur enjoy lasting peace, which will pave the way for
work in other areas, such as judicial justice and finding
a comprehensive solution to the Darfur question.

China has not changed its position on the ICC in
regard to Darfur.
