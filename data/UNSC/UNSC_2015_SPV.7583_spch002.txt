Mr. Oyarzun Marchesi (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): I have the honour to present the report of
the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1737
(2006) in accordance with paragraph 18 (h) of the same
resolution. The present report covers the period from
15 September to 14 December, during which time the
Committee held an informal meeting on 24 November
and conducted additional work using the no-objection
procedure envisioned by paragraph 15 of the guidelines
for the conduct of its work.

I am pleased to note that on 18 October, the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) came into
effect, 90 days after the endorsement of the JCPOA
by the Security Council through resolution 2231
(2015). That day is known as "adoption day". While
the JCPOA participants began at that time to prepare
all the measures necessary to implement the nuclear
agreement, all provisions set forth in resolutions 1737
(2006), 1747 (2007), 1803 (2008) and 1929 (2010)
remain in force until implementation day, when the
Security Council sanctions measures will be lifted as
relevant Security Council resolutions are terminated.
The Committee further notes that paragraph 21 of
resolution 2231 (2015) provides for exemptions to
the current measures with regard to certain activities
related to the Fordow and Arak facilities, and the export
of Iran's enriched uranium in excess of 300 kilograms
in return for natural uranium.

During the reporting period, the Committee
considered its 2015 annual report on 9 December
through its no-objection procedure. The report has
been submitted to the President of the Security
Council and will be issued as document S/2015/947.
The annual report provides an overview of the range
of activities pursued by the Committee in 2015, in
accordance with its mandate. I would like to highlight
that the Committee has recently revised its guidelines
to include the additional mandated tasks in accordance
with paragraphs 21, 22 and 23 ofresolution 2231 (2015).

During the period under review, the Committee
received two reports from Member States alleging
violations of paragraph 9 of resolution 1929 (2010) and
paragraph 5 of resolution 1747 (2007), respectively.
At the informal consultations held on 24 November,
the Committee instructed the Panel of Experts to
investigate the two reported incidents and report back to
the Committee on the Panel's findings and conclusions.
On 9 December, the Panel submitted to the Committee
its investigation report on an incident reported by a
Member State on 27 July. The Panel concluded that the
attempted procurement of grade 5 titanium alloy bars
constitutes a violation by Iran pursuant to provisions of
Security Council resolution 1737 (2006) and subsequent
resolutions. However, the Panel could not reach a
definitive conclusion on this being a wilful violation by
Iran's authorities.

The Panel also submitted to the Committee on
11 December an inspection report concerning the
alleged test launch of an Emad ballistic missile by Iran
on 10 October, which was reported to the Committee
by a Member State on 21 October on behalf of three
other Member States. The Panel concluded that the
Emad launch was a violation by Iran of paragraph 9 of
resolution 1929 (2010).

The Committee received four notifications - three
from a Member State, of which one was submitted
in accordance with paragraph 22 of resolution 2231
(2015) - informing it of the delivery of natural
uranium to Iran; two in accordance with paragraph 21
of resolution 2231 (2015), informing it of the transfer
of low-enriched uranium from Iran; and one from a
Member State informing of its successful disposal, in
cooperation with another State, of a cargo pursuant to
paragraph 17 of resolution 1929 (2010).

With regard to a request from a specialized United
Nations agency seeking to provide technical assistance

to Iran, the Committee continues to consider its
response.

During the reporting period, the Panel submitted
its mid-term report to the Committee on 6 November,
in accordance with paragraph 2 of resolution 2224
(2015). Following a discussion by the Committee of the
report on 24 November, it was submitted to the Security
Council on 3 December.

The Panel continues to carry out its activities in
accordance with its mandate set forth in paragraph 29
of resolution 1929 (2010). It is currently completing
one more investigation report on an earlier incident
reported by a Member State concerning paragraph 13
of resolution 1929 (2010). The Panel is planning to
conduct an investigation into an incident reported by
a Member State to the Committee on 24 November,
which concerns paragraph 5 of resolution 1747 (2007).
The Committee looks forward to the Panel's findings
and conclusions in that regard.
