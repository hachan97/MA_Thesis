Mr. Tumysh (Kazakhstan): Kazakhstan recognizes
that this conflict is one of the most long-standing
ones in Africa and that the views of the parties do
not converge. In that regard, we reiterate that there is
no alternative to the process of reconciling interests,
making compromises and seeking mutually acceptable
solutions, without fuelling further confrontations.

Kazakhstan welcomes the active efforts of the
Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Western
Sahara, Mr. Horst Kohler, in exploring the positions
of the parties and seeking ways to find compromises
through a number of high-level meetings in the region
and beyond. We see that as a promising sign and
encourage Mr. Kohler to continue his engagement
through a wide range of actors in order to broaden their
support and commitment to relaunching the political
process in the spirit of a new dynamic.

Kazakhstan recognizes the important role played
by the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in
Western Sahara on the ground and voted in favour of
renewing its mandate for the next term. We express
hope that, during the new mandate, efforts towards
rapprochement and negotiations will be redoubled.

At the same time, it is obvious that the adoption
by consensus of resolutions on mandate renewals of
United Nations peacekeeping operations would send a
stronger message to all of the parties concerned. It is
also our understanding that the international efforts to
advance political reconciliation should be consolidated
under the United Nations-led efforts. It is important for
the Council to maintain unity, support the work of the
Personal Envoy and send a clear signal to the parties.

Finally, a message was sent to the party to the
effect that they should refrain from any escalation that
could endanger the creation of conditions favourable
to the political process or the finding of a mutually
acceptable solution that is consistent with the purposes
and principles of the United Nations Charter.
