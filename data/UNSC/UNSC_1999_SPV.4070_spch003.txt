Mr. Dejammet (France) (spoke in French): The
Council is about to adopt a draft resolution extending the
sixth phase of the humanitarian arrangements in Iraq,
established by resolution 986 (1995), for a period of 15
days. We hope that the members of the Council will make
good use of this period of time in order to make progress
in the discussions aimed at preparing a comprehensive draft
resolution to make it possible to re-establish international
monitoring in Iraq and to restore cooperation between that
country and the United Nations.

France will spare no effort to ensure that such a
comprehensive draft resolution is adopted as soon as
possible, and by consensus. Only its unanimous adoption by
the members of the Council will offer any real prospect of
an end to the crisis.
