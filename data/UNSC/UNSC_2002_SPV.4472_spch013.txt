Ms. Lee (Singapore): We join others in thanking
Mr. Oshima for his excellent briefing and for the
comments expressed regarding the very important work
done by his team. We also join others in welcoming the
Vice-Minister's presence here today and thanking him
for his very important statement. Finally, we associate
ourselves with Mauritius's comments regarding the
very important work of Ambassador Gambari, who
knows full well that he has always had our unstinting
support.

I have only two questions to ask, because all the
comments we wanted to make have been covered by
other colleagues, especially with regard to the very
serious humanitarian situation in Angola.

First, the Government's current military
campaign against UNITA unfortunately appears to have
resulted in a significant increase in the number of
internally displaced persons in the affected areas. The
World Food Programme reported that in the Bie
province alone, more than 12,000 new internally
displaced persons were registered in January. We
wonder if any information can be provided on how the
Government will be tackling the consequences of this
fighting.

My second question relates to whether any
overtures have been made to UNITA to facilitate the
work of the humanitarian agencies, and if so, what
UNITA'S response has been thus far. Perhaps the Office
for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs could
also give an assessment of the prospects for UNITA's
facilitating such humanitarian work.
