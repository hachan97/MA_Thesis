The President: In my own national capacity, I
should like to add a couple of questions to those posed
to Minister Passy.

Of course, there are a number of issues dealt with
by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) that are coterminous with the issues
dealt with in the Security Council and in other
organizations to which Pakistan belongs, such as the
Organization of the Islamic Conference.

In this context, I was very interested to note Mr.
Passy's comment that OSCE and the United Nations
can work more closely with States in the region
bordering Afghanistan to promote regional security,
stability and cooperation. I wonder whether OSCE has
any specific thoughts on such cooperation, which
would naturally be of great interest to us.

He also mentioned that OSCE has been working
with the parties to seek a resolution on Nagorny
Karabakh. I still remember how, 10 years ago when
Pakistan was a member of this Council, we participated
in the elaboration and adoption of several
resolutions - 822 (1993), 853 (1993), 874 (1993) and
884 (1993), all adopted during and after the conflict.
Almost 10 years, I believe, have since elapsed; 12 May
will be the tenth anniversary of the ceasefire. We
wonder how OSCE intends to pursue the proposals
which have been made to seek a resolution of this
conflict, in conformity with the resolutions of the
Security Council, and whether any specific plans or
proposals are on the table in this context.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

I call on Minister Passy to respond to any of our
remarks.
