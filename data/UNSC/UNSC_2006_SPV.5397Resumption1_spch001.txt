The President (spoke in Spanish): As I indicated
this morning, I wish to remind all speakers to limit
their statements to no more than five minutes in order
to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing and to
deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is
His Excellency Mr. Albert Ramdin, Deputy Secretary-
General of the Organization of American States. I now
give him the floor.
