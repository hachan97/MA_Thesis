Mr. Chungong Ayafor (Cameroon) (spoke in French): My delegation welcomes the recent adoption
by consensus of the resolution on Western Sahara. This
resolution - the result of the efforts of all members of
the Council - attests to its determination to find a just,
lasting and mutually acceptable solution. The
flexibility and constructive spirit evinced by the parties
enabled the Council to achieve such a positive outcome
and to maintain its unity.
My country would like to congratulate the
Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy for their
tireless efforts and persistence in the pursuit of a
solution for Western Sahara. Cameroon reiterates its
faith in a negotiated solution accepted by all parties
and assures the Secretary-General and his Personal
Envoy of its support.

My delegation urges the parties to engage in
direct, frank and constructive dialogue with a View to
resolving their differences. We believe that this is the
only way to restore peace and cooperation in the
Maghreb in particular and in Africa in general.
