Mrs. Kawar (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): We thank
the members of the Security Council who voted in
favour of resolution 2214 (2015), presented by Jordan in
conjunction with Egypt and Libya and in application of
the Ministerial decision of the League of Arab States.

The threat represented by Islamic State in Iraq
and the Levant (ISIS) and other terrorist organizations
in Libya made it incumbent upon us as the Security
Council to take the initiative and express our support
for the legitimate Libyan Government in its efforts to
combat terrorism, especially the terrorism brought by
ISIS, Al-Qaida and Ansar al-Sharia. In addition, in
this resolution, the Council has expressed its support
and encouragement for States to assist the Libyan
Government in its efforts to fight terrorism.

Without concerted efforts to fight terrorism, the
situation in Libya and the region will deteriorate and
have repercussions not only in Libya but in all of North
Africa, the Middle East and the entire world. In that
regard, we must support the efforts of the legitimate
Libyan Government which requires that the sanctions
committee accelerate consideration of the requests
of the Libyan Government to obtain the equipment
and weapons it needs, as called for explicitly by the
resolution.

Jordan supports the efforts of the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General together with
those of the Libyan leadership to reach a political
solution to the growing challenges Libya is facing,
including the need to complete the democratic political
transition, build State institutions and embark on the
reconstruction of the country. At the same time, we
affirm the need to proceed in the fight against terrorism
in parallel with the political efforts under way without
confusing the two.
