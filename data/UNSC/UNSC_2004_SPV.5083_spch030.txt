President Ahmed: Our Prime Minister will
answer the questions posed by the Philippines. I would
like to thank you, Mr. President, as well as the
members of the Security Council, the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)
ministers and other officials, and I would like to
express our delegation's satisfaction at having
participated in this two-day Security Council meeting
in Nairobi on the Somali situation and how to solve
Somali problems. I assure you, Mr. President, along
with the rest of the Council, that I myself and the
Government of Somalia will do our utmost so that
Somalia will be at peace as soon as possible. We are
determined to do whatever we can, because our country
needs peace and reconstruction. We know that our task
is difficult, but that we are ready to face those
difficulties, and we are sure that Somalia will be at
peace as soon as possible.
