Mr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish):
We are grateful to you, Madam President, for having
organized this meeting, and to Mr. Griffiths for his
important briefing. We wish to commend and support
the efforts of the Special Envoy in the pursuit of lasting
peace in Yemen. We agree with him that, despite the
difficulties, common ground exists around which
Yemenis could converge towards a peaceful solution.
That is something that we could not say at the beginning
of this year.

We are concerned that it was not possible for the
Geneva consultations to proceed as planned due to
the absence of the Houthi delegation. We view that
as a setback that must be overcome. But under no
circumstances should that setback be interpreted as
justification for an escalation of fighting. We must bear
in mind the responsibility to prevent any exacerbation
of the situation, which already constitutes the worst
humanitarian crisis in the world today. On the contrary,
the complexity of the context and the mistrust and
distance between the parties are such that we should
step up our efforts to get them at last around the
negotiating table without preconditions.

Against that backdrop, we must record our concern
at the upsurge in violence seen in recent days and its
cost in humanitarian terms. It is our responsibility to
protect the civilian population, in accordance with
international humanitarian law. We stress that there can
be no recurrence of, or impunity for, atrocities against the
civilian population such as those observed last month,
including the attack that claimed the lives of dozens
of children, as well as terrorism and indiscriminate
attacks against the territory of Saudi Arabia.

I conclude by reaffirming Peru's commitment
to achieving a lasting peace in Yemen that ends the
humanitarian disaster, fosters regional stability and
ensures accountability for the atrocity crimes that have
been committed.
