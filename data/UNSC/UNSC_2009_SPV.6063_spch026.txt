Mr. Kafando (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French):
My delegation welcomes the Security Council's
adoption of resolution 1860 (2009) regarding the
present serious situation in the Middle East.

The Council could not remain indifferent to the
tragedy under way in Gaza, especially in the light of its
mandate, but also of the serious humanitarian
consequences. We believe that the Council should have
acted earlier, but, as the expression goes, better late
than never. That is why we joined the consensus, which
reflects the will of the Security Council to contribute to
putting an end to the suffering of the civilian
population. We feel that the message could have been
more clearly articulated, but we also know that the
sense of urgency required compromise. Now, we need
to do our utmost to ensure effective implementation of
this important resolution.

We would like once again to welcome the spirit
of compromise and the sense of responsibility
demonstrated by various parties, in particular the
Group of Arab States. We hope that the resolution we
have just adopted will contribute to the success of
other initiatives under way, ultimately achieving a
lasting political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.

From that standpoint, we would like to express
our support for and encouragement of the Secretary-
General, who has proposed to visit the region next
week.
