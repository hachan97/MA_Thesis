Mr. Ageyev (Kazakhstan) (interpretation from Russian): It was with profound concern that Kazakhstan
learned about the nuclear weapons tests conducted in India
and Pakistan in May. We are obliged to note with deep
regret that India and Pakistan, carried away by nuclear
ambitions, have seriously harmed international security.

This action has threatened the progress made in
disarmament and non-proliferation following the indefinite
extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons and the signing of the Comprehensive Nuclear-
Test-Ban Treaty.

The conduct of nuclear tests is increasing tensions in
the South Asian region. Kazakhstan calls on India and
Pakistan to refrain from making the nuclear choice and to
confirm their desire to achieve a safe and stable world,
global partnership and economic development.

Kazakhstan strongly opposes the proliferation of
nuclear weapons and calls on all States to display
responsibility and restraint. The leadership of Kazakhstan
feels that India and Pakistan should adhere to the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.
