Mr. Allen (United Kingdom): I would like to take
the floor in order to clarify the reference to Srebrenica
in our statement to the Security Council this morning.
The United Kingdom is clear that the Srebrenica
massacre was an act of genocide, as confirmed by the
judgments of the International Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia and the International Court of Justice.

The meeting rose at 7.10pm.
