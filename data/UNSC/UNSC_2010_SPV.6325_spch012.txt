Mr. Pankin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We welcome the statement to the Council by
the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, as well as
the briefing on the situation by Mr. Oscar Fernandez-
Taranco.

We express our condolences and deep regret
about all those who have died as a result of this
incident. In Moscow we are expressing our
condemnation and deepest concern regarding the
incident in international waters, especially because so
many people died and have been wounded, people
participating in a humanitarian convoy.

We need clarification of all factors in what
happened. It is obvious that the use of weapons against
civilians and stopping ships on the high seas without
justification is a gross violation of the norms of
international law. At the same time, we look at what
happened as confirmation of the need for a prompt
cessation of Israel's blockade in Gaza and for
implementation of realistic steps to ensure that the
humanitarian and social situation will go forward for
all people in the sector.

We are very concerned about the fact that this
incident happened at a time when there were the
prerequisites for moving forward in the Palestinian-

Israeli settlement. We hope that the tension that has
arisen will not have a long-term negative impact on the
prospects for this process.
