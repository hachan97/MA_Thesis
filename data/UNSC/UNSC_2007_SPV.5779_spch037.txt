Ms. Rodriguez de Ortiz (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): I would like to
apologize for having to take the floor once again. What
Venezuela cannot understand in all of this is that the
United States cannot comply with an extradition treaty
that was signed between both of our countries.
Venezuela has presented a legitimate and legal request,
complying with all of the necessary requirements, in
order to have the terrorist Luis Posada Carriles, a
refugee from Venezuelan justice, arrested and
extradited to our country and tried for his terrorist acts.
The Government of the United States has all of the
documentation that shows the terrorist nature of his
actions. Despite this, instead of complying with
international commitments adopted, they have chosen
to protect him and they have simply charged him with
minor immigration violations.

This is a case of protecting a terrorist. The
attitude of the United States Government in this case is
one of snubbing justice and snubbing the memory of
victims of terrorist acts, as well as the grief of the
family members of those victims.

The Security Council must act and the Counter-
Terrorism Committee has to review and evaluate this
case and compel the United States Government to
comply with its commitment to fight terrorism: its
obligations under the International Convention for the
Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, the Convention for
the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of
Civil Aviation and Security Council resolution 1373
(2001).
