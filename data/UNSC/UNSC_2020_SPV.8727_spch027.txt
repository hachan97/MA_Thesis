Mr. Falouh (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): 1 begin by recalling a legal rule: someone who has nothing to give cannot give it. How, then, can the representative of the terrorist Erdogan regime - a murderous, criminal, aggressive and looting regime - claim that they care about the interests of the Syrian people? The Erdogan regime is a terrorist one, recognized by the United Nations as such. Tens of thousands of foreign terrorist fighters have entered Syria through Turkish territories from more than 101 States. The United Nations has said that tens of thousands of them came from more than 100 States Members. This is a murderous regime that, along with its agents in Syria, namely, terrorist groups and Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham - Jabhat Al-Nusra - has committed the most heinous crimes against Syrians. It is an aggressive regime that has attacked and invaded Syrian territories. It is a regime that steals, having looted factories in Aleppo with the help of its terrorist groups and pillaged the natural resources of Syria. I would like to conclude by an Arab proverb, which says that he who is not ashamed can do whatever he wants. This applies to the Erdogan regime and its representative - this terrorist, murderous, aggressive and looting regime.
