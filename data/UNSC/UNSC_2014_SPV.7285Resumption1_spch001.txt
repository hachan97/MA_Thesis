The President (spoke in Spanish): In accordance
with rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure, I invite the representatives of Hungary and
Nicaragua to participate in this meeting.

Iwish to remind all speakers to limit their statements
to no more than four minutes so that the Council can
carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with
lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate
the texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version
when speaking in the Chamber.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Thailand.
