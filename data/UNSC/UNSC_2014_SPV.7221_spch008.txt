Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
voted in favour of resolution 2166 (2014), which the
Council just adopted. China deplores the crash of
Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 in eastern Ukraine,
which resulted in the loss of the 298 lives aboard. In
his recent statement while visiting Latin American
countries, Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed
shock at the crash, mourned the death of all the victims
and expressed condolences to the bereaved families.
He also stressed that an impartial and objective
investigation into this incident be undertaken so as to
establish the truth as soon as possible.

China supports an independent, impartial and
objective investigation into this incident. As a
specialized agency of the United Nations dealing with
international civil aviation affairs, the International
Civil Aviation Organization should play a crucial
role in an international investigation. China calls
on all the parties to collaborate and cooperate with
the international investigation. China believes that
our current focus should be on establishing the truth
of the crash. Pending that, all sides should not jump
to conclusions or engage in conjecture or mutual
recrimination. We believe that the unanimous action
by the Council today will help to enhance mutual trust
and cooperation among all sides and to facilitate swift
progress in the investigation.
