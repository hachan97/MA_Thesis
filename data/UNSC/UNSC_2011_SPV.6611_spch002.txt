Mr. Touray (Sierra Leone): I have only asked for
the floor to express our sincere gratitude to the
Security Council for unanimously adopting resolution
2005 (2011) this morning, on the extension of the
mandate of the United Nations Integrated
Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone. It is indeed a
reflection of the solidarity and commitment of the
Council to ensuring that the gains so far made in our
peacebuilding efforts are kept on track, and not
derailed.

A few days ago, my Foreign Minister addressed
the Council (S/PV.6609). I believe that he reaffirmed
that, in addition to our existing political will and
commitment, there is an interest on the part of all right-
thinking people and citizens of the country, State and
non-State actors in general, to ensure a smooth and
successful outcome to the 2012 elections and to help
gravitate the country from a peacebuilding mode to a
development and growth mode.

At this juncture, I would solicit the Council's
assistance and cooperation to that end, including that
of all right-thinking people and international players.
