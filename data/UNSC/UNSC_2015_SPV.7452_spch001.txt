In accordance with rule 39 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure, I invite Ms. Valerie
Amos, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian
Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, to
participate in this meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members to
document S/2015/368, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the implementation of Security
Council resolutions 2139 (2014), 2165 (2014) and 2191

Coordinator, to thank her for her exceptional service.
The Council wishes her every success in her future
endeavours.

I now give the floor to Ms. Amos.
