The President: There are no more names inscribed on the list of speakers.As this is the last scheduled meeting of the Council for the month of January, I would like to express the sincere appreciation of the delegation of Viet Nam to the members of the Council and to the Council secretariat for all the support they have given us. Indeed, it has been a busy month, during which we rose to consensus on several important issues within our purview. We could not have done it alone or without the hard work, support and positive contributions of all members, their delegations, representatives of the secretariat, conferences services officers, interpreters, verbatim reporters and security staff. As we end our presidency, I now speak on behalf of the entire Council in wishing the delegation of Belgium good luck in the month of February. The meeting rose at 10.40 a.m.
