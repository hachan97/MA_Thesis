Mr. Malwal (South Sudan): Allow me to
congratulate you, Madam President, at the end of your
duties as the President of the Security Council for this
month. Your tenure was indeed full and eventful. Also,
we would like to congratulate Poland for joining the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development Partners
Forum. We look forward to your upcoming visit to
South Sudan.

I would also like to thank the countries that have
abstained from supporting resolution 2418 (2018)
because the peace process in South Sudan is at a critical
juncture right now. There is a light at the end of the
tunnel, and the annex to the resolution is unfortunate
and unhelpful. The danger is that it might not produce
the desired result for those who supported the resolution.
Nevertheless, the Government of South Sudan Will
work with the region to achieve lasting peace for the
people of South Sudan.
