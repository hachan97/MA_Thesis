Mr. Duclos (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): We welcome
the adoption of resolution 2494 (2019). We voted in
favour of the resolution, based on our belief in the
importance of supporting the crucial role played by the
United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara in maintaining calm and upholding the ceasefire
in the separation zone, and in keeping with the efforts
of the Secretary-General to revive the political process
in Western Sahara. In our view, there is an urgent need
to resume the political process without preconditions
and in good faith in order to achieve a fair and lasting
political solution mutually acceptable to the parties
on the basis of international law and the relevant
resolutions of the Security Council, which provide for
the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.

We are grateful for President Horst Kohler's work,
which restored forward momentum to the political
process, and we hope his replacement will be appointed
promptly with a view to keeping up that momentum. We
firmly believe that the parties and their neighbouring
States will maintain their steadfast commitment to
continuing the negotiating process through talks under
the auspices of the United Nations and the incoming
Personal Envoy.
