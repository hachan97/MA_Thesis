Mr. Wang Guaugya (China) (spoke in Chinese):
The Chinese delegation welcomes the resolution on
Iraq just adopted by the Security Council. China has
always attached great importance to the post-war
reconstruction of Iraq. We have always maintained that
the United Nations should play an active and effective
role in the reconstruction process.

One month ago the Secretary-General
recommended the creation of a United Nations
assistance mission for Iraq. We believe that very
important recommendation will help strengthen the role
of the United Nations in Iraq's reconstruction. China
supports the establishment of the United Nations
Assistance Mission for Iraq as soon as possible.

China welcomes the establishment of the
Governing Council of Iraq. We believe that it is an
important step towards Iraqi self-government. We also
look forward to the early and full restoration of Iraqi
sovereignty.

In the light of the above-mentioned
considerations, the Chinese delegation voted in favour
of the resolution.
