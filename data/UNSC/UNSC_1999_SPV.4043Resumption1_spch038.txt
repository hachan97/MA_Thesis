Mr. Ngo Quang Xuan (Viet Nam): Allow me at the
outset to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the
presidency of the Security Council for the month of
September. I believe that under your leadership the work of
this Council will have a successful outcome.

It is an honour for me to speak to the Security Council
in this open debate on the situation in East Timor. Being a
country in the South-East Asian region, Viet Nam is
certainly very concerned about the recent developments in
East Timor. It is our wish that the situation there will soon
stabilize and that a favourable environment will prevail so
as to facilitate a lasting solution satisfactory to all the
concerned parties and thus make a contribution to the
consolidation of peace, stability, cooperation and
development in South-East Asia and in the world.

It is obvious that the situation in East Timor is very
complicated. An enduring settlement must, therefore, be
based on the 5 May Agreements signed between Indonesia
and Portugal. According to the reports we have received,
the Republic of Indonesia has made a considerable number
of efforts with a view to restoring peace and security in
East Timor. The deployment of any multinational forces in
East Timor must comply with the 5 May Agreements and
have the consent of the Indonesian Government and the
approval of the United Nations.

We believe that with the goodwill and cooperation
of all the concerned parties and Member countries, a
satisfactory solution for East Timor will finally be
achieved.
