Mr. Duclos (France) (spoke in French): The
Security Council traditionally decides by consensus on
the issue of Western Sahara. This is a critically
important and decisive element that endows the action
of the United Nations with full force in helping the
parties find a just and lasting solution to this dispute.

Following sometimes arduous negotiations, the
French delegation welcomes the fact that consensus
was maintained in the adoption of the draft resolution
submitted today. That resolution makes clear the fact
that the Security Council is not deviating from the
approach it has been taking in dealing with the issue of
Western Sahara, which seems to us the best way of
making progress towards a lasting settlement.

Indeed, this resolution does not impose a solution
on the parties, which would have been likely to cause
the dynamic process of dialogue and efforts towards
peace to break down. Rather, it prompts a resumption
of discussions, backed by the confidence of the
Council.

The Secretary-General had noted in June 2001 the
deadlock regarding the peace plan. Other ideas had to
be found that would make it possible to achieve
progress towards a equitable solution to the dispute. In
this context, we commend Mr. Baker's efforts to come
up with imaginative options and to provide fresh
impetus to the quest for a political solution agreed on
by the parties. It is this track that must be pursued.
