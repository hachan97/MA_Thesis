The President: I thank Sir Jeremy Greenstock for
his very comprehensive briefing and for his kind words
addressed to me as one of his Vice-Chairmen.

As agreed in informal consultations, I intend to
give the floor alternately to three members of the
Council and three non-Council members, and then
request the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism
Committee to reply to the questions after every six
speakers. Of course, if there are no questions we will
proceed with the list of speakers. Furthermore, in View
of the long list speakers, I would urge all speakers to
limit their interventions to five to seven minutes. I
know I can count on their understanding and
cooperation.
