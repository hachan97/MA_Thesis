We welcome Her Excellency Mrs. Marsudi for presiding over this important debate. I note that this week, six years ago, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant unleashed massacres against Yazidi men and women in Iraq. Those atrocities are a vivid example of how terrorism not only poses a threat to international peace and security, but also significantly affects the lives of millions of ordinary people across the globe. Very often, the spread of extremist violence relies on weapons and finances delivered through organized crime networks, as noted in today's substantive briefings of Under-Secretary-General Vladimir Voronkov and Executive Director Ghada Fathi Waly. Countering terrorism requires a better understanding of the intricate link between transnational crime and terrorist activities. In that regard, Estonia recognizes the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate in providing the membership of the United Nations and the Security Council with updates on the development of the complex relationship between terrorism and organized crime. Those contributions enable us to coordinate comprehensive national, regional and international efforts to stop the fuelling of violent extremism. For its part, Estonia has benefited from insights gleaned at the United Nations in developing a counter-terrorism plan and priorities for 2020-2030. At the regional level, we highlight the role played by European Union agencies, namely, the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation and the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation, in combating all forms of international organized crime and terrorism. We welcome the increased cooperation of these agencies with the United Nations.
