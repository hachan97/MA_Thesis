Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): I
congratulate the Republic of Korea on its assumption
of the presidency of the Security Council for the month
of May. I would also like to thank Ambassador ngu
and the Nigerian team for their admirable stewardship
of the Council in April.

Thank you for convening this meeting, Mr. President.
The Russian Federation has described this morning's
events in eastern Ukraine as a punitive military
operation against peaceful activists. This is yet
again a gross distortion of the facts. The Ukrainian
Government has the right, and indeed the responsibility,
to uphold the rule of law and protect its citizens in its
own territory. Of course, in doing so it should at all
times act in a proportionate and measured way. The
actions undertaken this morning by Ukrainian security
forces in and around Sloviansk appear to have been
just that, in an effort to relieve the city from the armed
groups, sponsored and controlled by Russia, that have
been terrorizing the local population. We urge them to
continue to make every effort to ensure that the risks to
civilians are minimized.

But let us be absolutely clear. There is no Council
member sitting around this table that would allow its
towns to be overrun by armed militants. None of us
would abrogate responsibility for the protection of
citizens on our own territory who are being intimidated
and brutalized by heavily armed groups backed by
a neighbouring country. Proportionate is not the
same as passive. The scale of Russian hypocrisy is
breathtaking. Russia stoutly supports, and indeed
arms, the most repressive regimes in the world, notably
Syria, a regime that brutally represses dissent without
any sense of restraint or concern for the protection of
civilians. Russia's synthetic indignation over Ukraine's
proportionate and measured actions convinces no one.
Russian claims that these are peaceful activists are
simply not credible. Peaceful activists do not have the
means or the capability to shoot down three Ukrainian
military helicopters, reportedly using man-portable
air defence systems. The use of such sophisticated
weaponry against Ukrainian forces reaffirms our
assessment that the armed groups in eastern Ukraine
include professionals funded, equipped and directed by
Russia.

The situation in eastern Ukraine has continued to
deteriorate. Armed groups stormed the Prosecutor's
office in Donetsk yesterday, further increasing the
number of Government buildings occupied since the
17 April Geneva agreement. We remain seriously
concerned about the kidnapping and continued
detention of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe's Vienna Document inspectors,
and call on Russia to condemn this criminal act and
use its influence over those who are holding the
inspectors to bring about their immediate, safe and
unconditional release. We are deeply disturbed by the
reports of abductions and intimidation of journalists
reporting from eastern Ukraine. The Council discussed
the protection of journalists in an open debate last year
(see S/PV.7003). One of its clearest conclusions was on
the central importance of safeguarding a free media so
that facts and truth can be told. Instead, what we are
seeing in Ukraine is a torrent of disinformation and
propaganda.

Three days ago, all the members of the Council
emphasized the importance of the 17 April agreement
and its implementation (see S/PV.7I65). Abiding by
that agreement remains the best way to de-escalate the
volatile and dangerous situation in eastern Ukraine.
It is therefore regrettable that Russia's presidential
press secretary said this morning that Russia did not
think it any longer possible to implement the 17 April
agreement. Worsening instability in Ukraine is in no
one's long-term interest. We urge Russia to step back
from such rhetoric, to desist from its inflammatory
propaganda and to commit to de-escalating a perilous
situation. We urge Russia to throw its full weight behind
the 17 April agreement and rein in the militant armed
groups that it supports and that are responsible for the
current crisis.
