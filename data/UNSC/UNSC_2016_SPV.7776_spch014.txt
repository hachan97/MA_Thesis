Mr. Liu J ieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): Tomorrow
will mark the twentieth anniversary of the opening for
signature in New York of the Comprehensive Nuclear-
Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). Twenty years ago, in order
to comprehensively ban nuclear-test explosions and
any other nuclear explosions, thereby effectively
advancing the process of nuclear non-proliferation
and disarmament and enhancing international peace
and security, the international community negotiated
and concluded the CTBT. Over the past 20 years, the
nuclear-test ban has become a common understanding
of the international community.

Today's adoption by the Security Council of
resolution 2310 (2016) is of great significance in
commemorating the opening for signature of the
Treaty, reaffirming the purpose of the nuclear-test ban
and pushing for an early entry into force of the Treaty.

China has always stood for the comprehensive
prohibition and total destruction of nuclear weapons.
We have committed not to be the first-users of nuclear
weapons and we have committed unconditionally
not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against
non-nuclear-weapon States and nuclear-weapon-free
zones.

China was among the first countries to sign the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We have been
steadfast in maintaining the object and purpose of the
Treaty and in abiding by our nuclear-test moratorium
commitment. We will continue to work with all sides
to push for the early entry into force of the Treaty and
make unremitting efforts for the realization of the
comprehensive prohibition and total destruction of
nuclear weapons.
