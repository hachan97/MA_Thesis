Mr. Sardenberg (Brazil): Brazil abstained from
voting on the draft resolution put before the Security
Council this evening. We have been following very
closely the events taking place in Lebanon. This
interest comes from the friendly historic ties that link
us to the Lebanese people. Suffice it to say that there is
a large community of people of Lebanese descent in
my country. Bilateral relations with Lebanon constitute
a high priority for the Government of Brazil.

It is our view that resolution 1559 (2004) deals
with matters that are essentially within the domestic
jurisdiction of Lebanon. The existence of a dispute
likely to endanger international peace and security has
not been properly characterized in the text. If it had
been, the Security Council would have had to take into
consideration the procedures for settlement of the
dispute already adopted by the parties. Finally, we
took into account the legitimate expression to the
United Nations of the Governments of the countries
specifically concerned that the matter under
consideration is not within the Council's attributions.

The delegation of Brazil takes this opportunity to
reiterate its full commitment to the promotion of peace
and stability in the Middle East based on a just and
comprehensive settlement in all tracks, in conformity
with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338
(1973), 1397 (2002) and 1515 (2003); the Madrid
terms of reference; the principle of land for peace; the
existing agreements between the parties and the Arab
League initiative of Beirut.
