The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Ms. Johnson, Deputy Executive Director of UNICEF,
for her important briefing. I should also like to
highlight the value of the work on peacekeeping
being done jointly by UNICEF and the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General,
non-governmental organizations and civil society. I
also wish to emphasize the need for all of us to
continue to encourage that teamwork in order to
strengthen our ability to act.

I now give the floor to Ms. Manju Gurung, who,
as Special Representative of the Secretary-General
Coomaraswamy has already pointed out, was a child
soldier in Nepal.
