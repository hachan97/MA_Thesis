The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of Spain.

Spain welcomes the unanimous adoption of
resolution 2327 (2016), renewing the mandate of one
of the most important peacekeeping missions. The
situation in South Sudan continues to be of great
concern. The country is mired in a severe political,
economic, humanitarian and security crisis. As if that
were not enough, there are indications that the conflict
may well become an ethnic war. Everybody here, and
especially the authorities of South Sudan themselves,
must do their utmost in order to reverse the situation.

We take due note of the commitment made by the
Transitional Government of National Unity to the swift
deployment and full operationaliztion of the Regional
Protection Force. We hope that that will now move from
words into deeds, and that the contingent will be able to
fulfil its mandate as quickly as possible. It is essential
that UNMISS be able to operate without restrictions in
order to comply with its mandate, especially with regard
to the protection of civilians and the safe, unrestricted
delivery of humanitarian assistance.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

I give the floor to the representative of South Sudan.
