The President (spoke in Chinese): I shall now make
a statement in my capacity as the representative of China.
Many other Council members have expressed all of
what I would have wanted to say, so I shall try to make my
statement as brief as possible.

The Chinese delegation is deeply concerned at the
deteriorating situation in Sierra Leone. We support the
efforts of the international community, and in particular of
the countries and regional organizations concerned, to
defuse the crisis in Sierra Leone. We also convey our
appreciation to the Secretariat for its work in that
connection. We appeal to the international community to
continue to provide a range of emergency assistance to the
United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL).

Like other delegations, we believe that the Security
Council should adopt appropriate measures with respect
to the situation in Sierra Leone, including a review of the
mandate of UNAMSIL and the adoption of measures to
ensure that that mandate is fully implemented. We expect
the Secretariat to formulate recommendations in that
regard as soon as possible for consideration by the
Council.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

The next speaker is the representative of Sierra
Leone, on whom I now call.
