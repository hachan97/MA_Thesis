Mr. Ibrahim (Malaysia): In accordance with
paragraph 24 (e) of Security Council resolution 1970
(2011), of 26 February 2011, I have the honour to report
to the Security Council on the work of the Committee
established pursuant to the same resolution. The report
covers the period from 7 June to 14 September 2016.
The Committee dealt with a number of issues during
the reporting period Via the silence procedure, which I
will enumerate in chronological order.
On 15 June, the Under-Secretary-General for
Political Affairs submitted to the Committee a
notification under the arms embargo pursuant to
paragraph 13 (b) ofresolution 2009 (2011), in relation to
which the Committee did not take a negative decision.

On 7 July, the Committee received a letter from
the Coordinator of the Panel of Experts on Libya,
conveying its contribution to the report requested by
resolution 2292 (2016), on the threat posed to Libya
and neighbouring countries, including off the coast
of Libya, by foreign terrorist fighters. The report
reflecting the Panel's input has since been published as
document S/2016/627.

The Committee received another letter from
the Coordinator of the Panel of Experts on 14 July,
proposing updates to the Committee's implementation
assistance notice number 3. In the light of the adoption
of resolution 2292 (2016), the Committee subsequently,
on 18 August, updated that notice, which relates to
the reporting of detections of attempted or actual
violations of the arms embargo and the disposal of
embargoed material.

The Committee received a letter from the Permanent
Representative of Libya to the United Nations on
15 July, informing the Committee about the focal point

pursuant to paragraph 6 of resolution 2278 (2016). On
28 July, the Committee acknowledged that information
and invited the focal point to brief the Committee on
the elements set out in that paragraph.

On 18 August, the Committee received an
implementation report pursuant to paragraph 25
of resolution 1970 (2011) from the Permanent
Representative of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to
the United Nations.

On 23 August, the Committee approved a request
for the extension of a travel ban exemption for an
additional six months. In that connection, let me note
that both the implementation report and information on
the granted travel ban exemption can be found on the
website of the Committee.

Finally, on 29 August, the Committee received a
notification under the assets freeze measure, pursuant
to paragraph 19 (a) of resolution 1970 (2011), to which
it did not object.
