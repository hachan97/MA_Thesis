Mr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): At the
outset, I would like to convey our congratulations to
you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the
Security Council for the month of October. We are
confident that your wisdom will guide the Council to
the attainment of all our expectations. I would also like
to thank your predecessor, Sir Emyr Jones Parry, the
Permanent Representative of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, for his efforts during the month of
September. We further wish to thank the members of
the Council for their speedy response to the request
made by the Syrian Arab Republic and Lebanon to hold
an emergency meeting of the Security Council to
consider the dangerous escalation of aggression
perpetrated by Israeli forces against sites in the Syrian
Arab Republic and Israeli violation of Lebanese air
space.

The Foreign Ministry of Qatar issued a statement
this morning in which it condemned the raid launched
by Israeli forces against sites in Syria. We consider
those actions a grave threat to peace and security in the
Middle East that could drag the region back to war and
tension. My country reaffirms that it stands by the
sisterly Syrian Arab Republic. We call on the
international community to bring pressure to bear on
Israel to cease its aggression and commit itself to
implement internationally binding resolutions calling
on it to withdraw from all occupied Arab territory.

Israel's aggression against Syria is in clear
defiance of all international rules and laws. It is also a
clear violation of the Disengagement Agreement
between Syrian and Israeli forces. It also affirms
Israel's desire to export its internal crisis by waging
wider war in the guise of combating terrorism.

My country has joined the list of sponsors of the
draft resolution that has been submitted to the Council.
We are confident that, given the very delicate
circumstances, the Council will be able to assume its
full responsibility under the Charter of the United
Nations.
