Mr. Gillerman (Israel): I am sorry that I have to
take the floor again, but I must say that I am somewhat
dismayed, bewildered and shocked by the audacity of
an entity that has given the world aeroplane hijackings
and hostage kidnappings - and that, in fact, invented
suicide bombings - trying to give us a lesson in
democracy, human rights, international law and law
and order.

There is a very clear connection between
Palestinian terror and international terror. Terror is
terror. There is no difference between Palestinian terror
and international terror, as there is no difference
between Hamas and Al Qaeda. Therefore, I think that
the Members of the United Nations and the members of
the Security Council should realize, sadly, that until the
Palestinians realize that they are on the wrong side of
the fight against terrorism and decide to choose the
path of peace and reconciliation - as has been offered
to them by Israel time and time again and as has been
rejected by them time and time again - they will,
sadly, probably not be Member of the United Nations
for a long time to come.
