Mr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish):
We wish to welcome the adoption of resolution 2466
(2019), which renews the mandate of the United Nations
Mission for Justice Support in Haiti (MINUJUSTH) for
a final period of six months, until 15 October, in line
with the recommendation of the Secretary-General and
the expectations of the Government of Haiti.

Nevertheless, in accordance with resolution
2410 (2018), Peru believes that we must reiterate
that, within the framework of the exit strategy and
transition of MINUJUSTH, we must continue bearing
in mind the security conditions on the ground and the
overall capacity of Haiti to guarantee stability across
its territory.

Accordingly, based on the new report on the
operational details of the special political mission that
has been requested, we hope to promptly begin the
negotiation process, with a view to ensuring a smooth
transition and the establishment and full operation of the
mission by 16 October 2019. Peru is firmly committed
to Haiti's being able to continue to count on the support
and assistance of the United Nations through a robust
special political mission together with the human and
financial resources it needs.
