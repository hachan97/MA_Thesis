The President: I thank the representative of
Argentina for his kind words addressed to me.

I would like to inform the members of the Security
Council and others participating in its work that there is
a large number of speakers on my list. It is the intention
of the President to suspend the meeting at 1 pm. and to
resume at 3 pm.
