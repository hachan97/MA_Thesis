Mr. Bessho (Japan): The use of chemical weapons
is entirely unacceptable under any circumstances.
There is full agreement within the Security Council on
this point, and it is shared by the entire international
community. We jointly condemn in the strongest
possible terms the use of chemical weapons in Syria,
which has resulted in the deaths of many civilians.
Members of the Security Council also share the
view that the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative
Mechanism (JIM), an important Council product of
2015, should continue to work.

Yesterday, however, two draft resolutions - both of
which proposed to extend the JIM's mandate for another
12 months - failed to be adopted. Japan has proposed
a draft resolution (S/2017/970) to allow for further
discussions among Council members to consider the
future of the JIM. We hope that the proposed report to
be submitted by the Secretary-General on proposals for
the structure and methodology of the JIM, reflecting
the views of Council members, will help us to find the
best way forward.

Chemical-weapons use in Syria continues. Until all
perpetrators have been identified, the work of the JIM
should continue. The Council is ultimately responsible
for ensuring accountability for the use of chemical
weapons, and the JIM. is vitally important for pursuing
that task. Japan hopes that the Council can adopt the
draft resolution.
