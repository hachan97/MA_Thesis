Mr. Hachani (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): I
congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the
presidency for the month of October. My appreciation
goes to Ambassador Emyr Jones Parry for the way in
which he guided the work of the Council last month.
My delegation thanks you, Mr. President, for having
responded so quickly to the request to convene this
meeting to discuss recent events in the Middle East.

Tunisia learned with grave concern of Israel's act
of aggression against fraternal Syria. We condemn that
act of aggression and stand in solidarity with Syria. We
believe it threatens a serious escalation and violates
international law. It poses a threat to regional security
and constitutes a violation of resolution 338 (1973). It
is a flagrant violation of Syria's sovereignty and
territorial integrity. Furthermore, Tunisia vigorously
deplores the violation of Lebanese air space in the
commission of this aggression against Syria.

Tunisia believes that this unjustified act of
aggression will further complicate the situation in the
region and will bring further escalation, violence and
destabilization. Here, Tunisia appeals to the Israeli
Government to halt such acts of provocation so as to
prevent the region from being caught up in a cycle of
violence. We call on the international community to
shoulder its responsibilities and to take urgent and
forceful measures to prevent the escalation of the
situation.

My delegation cannot fail to welcome the
responsible position taken by the Government of Syria,
rejecting the logic of violence in the face of Israeli
escalation. The Council should take this into account.
