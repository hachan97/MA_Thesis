The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.

At today's meeting, the Security Council will be
briefed by the representatives of Egypt and France, two
of the co-leaders of the Security Council mission to
Africa that took place from 21 to 23 January.

I now give the floor to the representative of France,
who will brief us on the Security Council's visit to
Burundi.
