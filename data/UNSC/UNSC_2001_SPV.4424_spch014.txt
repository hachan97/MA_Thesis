Mr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): I also join other
colleagues who have thanked Mr. Oshima for his
briefing, and not just for his briefing, but also for the
elaboration thereafter on the queries posed by the
representatives of Norway, Singapore, Colombia,
Ukraine and Ireland.

We are pleased with the way Mr. Oshima's office
has worked on the follow-up to the June letter, and we
are pleased with the progress that he has reported on
the issues of the road map, the aide-memoire and closer
coordination. But as the situation develops, we think
that there is a sense of urgency with regard to some of
the crucial problems that the Council is engaged in.
Afghanistan is very much a case in point. While we
look to the comprehensive report in November, we
wonder if there is some way that it could be expedited,
perhaps by issuing an interim report, in order to react
to the urgency of the situation in some parts of the
world.

Again, with regard to Afghanistan, as the ancient
Greeks used to say, you never step into the same river
twice. And I take Mr. Oshima's point that every case is
to a large extent specific and should be determined on
its own merits. But in a situation like the one in
Afghanistan, where there are so many non-State actors,
as Ambassador Mahbubani has said, there is a need to
bring about normative changes in the behaviour
patterns of non-State actors. This was a major thrust
that, in his view, should be undertaken. We in
Bangladesh believe that one way to do so would be to
inculcate a culture of peace in the protagonists, but
this, of course, is not easy to achieve. However, would
the traditional checklist that we have been thinking of
be relevant to Afghanistan? Should we ask Afghanistan
to change or should we have a separate checklist that is
relevant to its situation, where all the protagonists are
basically non-State actors?
