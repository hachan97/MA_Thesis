Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria) (spoke in French): I
would like first of all to congratulate you, Sir, on your
assumption of the presidency of the Security Council
for the month of July. I would also like to congratulate
the French presidency on the outstanding way in which
the work of the Council was conducted last month.

I would like to thank Mr. Danilo Turk for his very
useful and comprehensive briefing on recent events in
the Bougainville peace process. Since the signing of
the Bougainville Peace Agreement, the peace process
has seen considerable success. We welcome the
holding, last month, of the first general elections and
the election of the President and members of the House
of Representatives of the Autonomous Region of
Bougainville. We pay particular tribute to the political
will and the constructive attitude shown towards the
peace process by the Government of Papua New
Guinea and the leaders of Bougainville.

It is now important to ensure the maintenance of
peace and stability in Bougainville. We welcome the
support provided by the international community, in
particular the important contributions made by
countries of the region, by donor-community partners
and by the United Nations system. We request the
relevant United Nations entities and donor countries to
continue to provide aid and to assist in post-conflict
reconstruction. The international community should
continue to help the Government of Papua New Guinea
and the people of Bougainville in their efforts to pursue
economic and social development and to bring lasting
peace to the region.

In conclusion, I congratulate the United Nations
Observer Mission in Bougainville and its predecessor,
the United Nations Political Office in Bougainville, on
their fine work and on their efforts to ensure the
successful implementation of the Peace Agreement.
