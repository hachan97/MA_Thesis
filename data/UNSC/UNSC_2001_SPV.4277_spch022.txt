Mr. Guehenno: I will convey to Special
Representative Hans Haekkerup and his staff the
support that was expressed around this table for his
efforts.

I would like to address the one specific question
that was put to me on security by the representative of
the United Kingdom, and in particular on the provision
of international judges.

The development of a judiciary system in Kosovo
that really builds trust between the various
communities is a key foundation. It is a building block
of any stable peace in that part of the world. We have
seen that international judges are very helpful in that
respect, not only because they create the perception of
impartiality and help consolidate that perception, but
also because they make it easier for those local judges
who want to be impartial to be so and to resist the
pressures that can be exerted upon them.

In that respect, we have increased the number of
international judges. Last December there were only 10
international judges and 3 international prosecutors. As
I said in my briefing, we now have 12 judges and 5
prosecutors, which means that we can cover all five
regions of Kosovo, with an international presence in
the judiciary, which is very important.

We will continue to discuss with the Mission
whether we can go further in developing the presence
of international justice, because a delicate balance has
to be maintained between local empowerment of
justice and the international presence. This is a very
delicate balance. But we will continue to discuss with
the Mission whether we can make improvements and
go further. We welcome offers from Member States to
provide international judges, because it is a very
difficult and challenging job. We are very grateful to
all of those countries that have provided international
judges in Kosovo.
