Mr. Orrenius Skau (Sweden): We also welcome
the adoption of resolution 2409 (2018) and thank
the French delegation for its work in facilitating the
Security Council's work on the resolution.

The year 2018 will be a crucial one for the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and it is clear
that the United Nations Organization Stabilization
Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(MONUSCO) has a critical role to play. One decisive
step towards peace and stability will be the holding of
credible, transparent, inclusive and peaceful elections
on 23 December, ensuring the democratic transfer of
power, in accordance with the Constitution and the
31 December 2016 political agreement. MONUSCO
has now been given the task of providing the
Democratic Republic of the Congo with logistical and
technical support and good offices for this endeavour,
including ensuring the participation, involvement
and representation of women at all levels. It has also
been given the task of protecting civilians through a
comprehensive approach, making better use of early
warning and early responses, including prevention, as
well as by improving its military response. In all of
this, the Mission needs to be given adequate resources.

I would also like to take this opportunity to
underline the important role of the relevant regional
organizations and neighbouring countries in ensuring
an environment for credible elections. We look forward
to continuing to engage with regional actors in order
to facilitate united Council action in support of
such efforts.
