Mr. Hoxhaj: I am aware that this has been a fairly
long meeting, so I will be fairly brief. I would like to
make a couple of points in response to the statement
made today by the representative of the Russian
delegation.

Kosovo is seriously concerned about the escalation
of the conflicts in Iraq and Syria and about Russia's
increasing aggression against Ukraine. Like the rest
of the international community, Kosovo is shocked
by the brutal acts of violence being committed in
those countries and has condemned them. Regarding
Syria, a small number of citizens from our region have
participated in the ongoing conflict there. Kosovo has
condemned them for taking part in a foreign conflict
and has taken preventive and legal measures against
them. Some of them have been arrested.

We are also against the participation of citizens
of Serbia in support of the pro-Russian separatist
groups in eastern Ukraine. I do not think that the
Russian Federation is in any position today to preach
about the situation in Kosovo or to express concerns
about our region. Russia is crossing every red line of
international order, law and practice. We condemned
Russia's occupation of Crimea as we now condemn the
current aggression in eastern Ukraine. Because of this,
Russia has lost most of the international credibility
and legitimacy that would allow it to preach about
international peace, justice and stability. Russia is
currently becoming the main threat to international
peace and stability.

Here I would also like to reiterate the concern of
the Republic of Kosovo about the Russian-Serbian air-
force drills that have been announced for 2015, and
other military activities organized between those two
countries, as a dangerous development for security and
stability in south-eastern Europe.
