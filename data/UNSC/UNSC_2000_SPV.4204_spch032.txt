Mr. Ouane (Mali) (spoke in French): Mali is
happy to see the Security Council meet under your
leadership during the month of October, Mr. President.
I wish to thank you for the kind words that you and
other members of the Council have addressed to me in
connection with Mali's term as President of the
Council.

My delegation is grateful to you for having
organized this open debate. As was expressed publicly
by the Government of Mali on 1 October, I wish to
reaffirm our sympathy for the families of the victims.
Secondly, true to its principles, Mali strongly
condemns all acts of violence and aggression,
including the bloodshed of the last five days.

Thirdly, Mali strongly supports the creation of an
international fact-finding commission to establish
responsibility for the events of the last few days.
Fourthly, following the shocking images shown by the
media over the last few days, we believe it is urgently
necessary that the provisions of the 1949 Geneva
Protocols be respected.

Fifthly and lastly, for Mali the renewal of the
peace process is the only way to reach a settlement of
this continuing problem. In this context, the visit to
Paris on 4 October by President Arafat and Prime
Minister Ehud Barak offers a useful opportunity to help
end the violence and renew the parties' commitment to
resuming the peace process.
