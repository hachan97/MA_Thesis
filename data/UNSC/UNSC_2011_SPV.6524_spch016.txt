Mr. Barbalie (Bosnia and Herzegovina): At the
outset, allow me to thank Under-Secretary-General
Lynn Pascoe for providing us with the briefing on
recent developments in Syria.

Bosnia and Herzegovina expresses its deep
concern with regard to the situation in Syria and its
regret over the loss of life and the high number of
injuries. We offer our most sincere condolences to the
families and friends of those who have lost their lives.
We also join others today in condemnation of the
ongoing violence which must stop immediately. All
those responsible for these crimes must be brought to
justice and held accountable for their actions.

We take note of the lifting of the state of
emergency and of the programme of reforms
announced by President Al-Assad. We share the view
of the Secretary-General that the effective
implementation of reforms is necessary to address the
legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people and ensure
social peace and order in Syria. Moreover, it is our
strong belief that the aspirations and demands of the
people should be addressed through an inclusive and
meaningful Syrian-led ballot.

In conclusion, Syria's critical importance to the
peace and security of the Middle East cannot be
overstressed. Therefore, while fully supporting Syria's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, we strongly
believe that the aspirations and demands of the people
should be addressed through an inclusive and
meaningful Syrian-led ballot.
