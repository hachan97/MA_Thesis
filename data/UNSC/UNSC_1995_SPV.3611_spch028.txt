The President (interpretation from Russian): There
are still a number of speakers on the list. In view of the
lateness of the hour, I intend, with the concurrence of the
members of the Council, to suspend the meeting.

The meeting was suspended at 1.15 p.m. and resumed
at 4.20 p.m.

The President (interpretation from Russian): I now
call on the representative of Malaysia.
