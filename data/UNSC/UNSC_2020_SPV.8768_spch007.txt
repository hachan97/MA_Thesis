The President (spoke in Russian): I shall now make a statement in my national capacity. The Russian Federation abstained in the voting on resolution 2547 (2020), on the extension of the mandate of the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti. We value the efforts of the sponsors to include in the document important elements on the role of the Parliament and the need for national dialogue to surmount the problems besetting the country and to conduct elections. At the same time, we regret the fact that not all of the concerns of Security Council members were taken into account. For example, the document fails to mention the most serious problems with violence vis-a-vis civilians, encroachment on human rights and corruption. It also does not mention the need to respect the country's Constitution when adopting momentous decisions. It is a great pity that the artificially short timelines prevented an agreement from being reached on what is necessary under present conditions, that is, a substantive document that would go beyond the framework of a mere technical resolution. That is all the more lamentable given that, under such difficult conditions in the country, it is exceedingly important to send a united Council message in support of national dialogue on the basis of the constitutional process. Port-au-Prince needs responsible international assistance. That is why the main goal of the mission, in our view, is to help facilitate nationwide discussions to end the deadlock and to address the situation on the basis of current legislation. We stand ready to provide all the necessary assistance to the Haitian people so that the fruit of the Council's efforts will be a genuine normalization of the situation in Haiti, strengthened sovereignty and self-sufficiency for the country. I now resume my functions as President of the Council. The meeting rose at 10.25 a.m.
