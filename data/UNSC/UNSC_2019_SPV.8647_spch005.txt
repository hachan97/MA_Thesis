Mrs. Heusgen (Germany): I thank the Belgian
Ambassador for his briefing as Chair of the Security
Council Committee pursuant to resolution 751 (1992)
concerning Somalia.

I can only echo and underline what the
representative of the United Kingdom has just said.
Germany continues to fully support the Panel of Experts
and its work. We also strongly urge the Government of
Somalia to cooperate with the Panel of Experts. The
instrument of sanctions against Al-Shabaab is used
to support the Somali Government. If such sanctions
are to succeed, the Government's cooperation with
the Panel is important and should be in the interest
of the Government. Germany welcomes and supports
the intention of the Panel of Experts to review the
charcoal ban in 2020, as mentioned, but we believe
that the environmental impacts of the charcoal trade,
notably the effects of deforestation and worsening
roads, should be reflected in this review, as they have
had a devastating impact on the population and the
development of the country.
