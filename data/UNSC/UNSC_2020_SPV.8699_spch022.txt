The President: I wish to remind all speakers to limit their statements to no more than four minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with longer statements are kindly requested to circulate the text in writing and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber. I wish to inform all concerned that we will suspend this open debate at | p.m. and resume it at 3 p.m. I now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary.
