The President: May I remind all speakers to limit
their statements to no more than four minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.

As a reminder, flashing lights on the collars of
the microphones will prompt speakers to bring their
remarks to a close after four minutes. If speakers have
not concluded one minute later, the presidency will
intervene and ask them to conclude. Delegations with
lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate the
text in writing and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking in the Chamber.

I also wish to inform all concerned that we will be
carrying on this open debate through the lunch hour, as
we have a long list of speakers.

I now give the floor to the representative of Brazil.
