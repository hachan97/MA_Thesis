The President (spoke in Russian): I thank
Ambassador Rice for her briefing, which, among other
things, aroused feelings of envy in those of us who
were not able to take part in the mission.

On behalf of the Council, I should like to express
appreciation to all of the members of the Security
Council and the Secretariat who participated in the
mission, which was very ably led by Ambassadors
Rugunda, Sawers, Ripert and Rice, for the manner in
which they discharged their important responsibilities
on behalf of the Council.

Although there are no names on my list of
speakers, I see that Ambassador Urbina is insisting on
his right to take the floor, and I call upon him now.
