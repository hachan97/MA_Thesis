The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Mr. Klein, Special Representative of the Secretary-
General for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Chief of
Mission, for his comprehensive briefing, which has
supplemented his previous briefings. I would also like,
on behalf of the members of the Council, to thank him
for the gift that he has given us on this important and
historic occasion.

I now give the floor to Mr. Mirko Sarovic',
Presiding Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
