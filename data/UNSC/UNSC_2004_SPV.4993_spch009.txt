The President: I thank the Vice-President of the
International Center for Transitional Justice for his
kind words of support for our initiative. I also take this
opportunity to thank him for recognizing the modest
contributions of the Philippines civil society
experience in facing challenges as we continue to build
peace in our society.

I shall now give the floor to the members of the
Council.
