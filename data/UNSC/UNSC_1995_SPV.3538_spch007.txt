Mr. Legwaila (Botswana): The delegation of
Botswana has already stated its position concerning Israel's
decision to expropriate land in East Jerusalem. I shall
therefore limit my remarks to the draft resolution before the
Council.

The draft resolution is a statement of facts. It makes
no value judgements. It does not deplore the action nor
condemn the offending party. There are no threats,
ultimatums or measures aimed at modifying or changing the
behaviour of the offending party. It deals directly and
incisively with the issue which is of concern to it, namely,
the expropriation of land in East Jerusalem. It is important
that the position of the Council on a matter that is so vital
to the Middle East peace process be made loud and clear,
without engaging in violent polemics.

The draft resolution fully supports the peace process
in the Middle East. Paragraphs 3 and 4 deal specifically
with this issue. The fourth, fifth and sixth preambular
paragraphs are devoted to this matter. Let there be no
impression, therefore, that by its action the Council is in
any shape or form harming the peace process. The action
which is inimical to the peace process is the Israeli decision
to expropriate land in East Jerusalem. It is our sincere hope
that Israel will heed the collective will of the international
community and rescind the expropriation orders.
