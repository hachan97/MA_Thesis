Dr. Hala: I thank you, Madam President, for
inviting me and my colleague Ms. Amina Khoulani to
speak here today.

My name is Hala. I am a doctor and a co-founder of
the Families for Freedom movement, which campaigns
for freedom and justice for Syria's detainees. I
left Syria at the end of 2011 after my husband was
detained. He has since been released, but my brother
and father-in-law, together with seven of my cousins,
were detained in 2013 and remain missing. Many of
my medical colleagues have also been detained by the
Syrian Government for helping wounded protesters.
Some ofthem have been killed while undergoing torture
in detention. It is in memory of them and the hundreds
of thousands of disappeared and murdered Syrians that
I appear before the Security Council today.

Although it is an honour for me speak here, I
cannot help but feel deep frustration at the people in the
Chamber for their inaction to end the sorrow of Syrian
detainees and their families. We are in the eighth year of
the Syrian conflict and at least 100,000 people remain
missing, many suffering abuses, deprivation and torture.
Syrian families, mine included, need to know what has
happened to their loved ones, and those responsible for
our suffering need to be held accountable.

The pain Syrian detainees have to endure has
been well documented by colleagues in Syrian and
international human rights organizations. Since 2011,
I have personally met dozens of survivors of detention
and torture and documented their stories, while
providing psychological care. Detainees in Syria face
physical and sexual abuse, torture, starvation and
extremely difficult living conditions. They are often
crowded into small, dark cells and some are forced to
live for months in solitary confinement rooms the size
of a coffin. Sometimes detainees are left for days in a
cell with dead bodies and develop serious psychological
issues, as well as physical problems, as a result. Female
detainees have been subjected to sexual and gender-
based violence at a high rate.

My husband often speaks to me about his own
experience, which left him deeply traumatized. He was
subjected to routine beatings. His cell was so tiny that
he did not have space to sit down. It was very cold and
damp. He and his cellmates were allowed to go to the
restroom only once a day.

As families whose loved ones have been forcibly
disappeared, we live in a constant state of uncertainty,
not knowing where our relatives are or what has
happened to them. Mothers in my country take
dangerous trips to courthouses and detention centres
every day. They stand for hours waiting for an answer.
They often come back home broken with nothing new,
yet they make that trip again and again. Families want
graves to mourn their loved ones - even that simple
right is something we have to ask for today.
As families, we have suffered enough. I am here
today to urge the Council to act. The Council must adopt
a resolution to put pressure on the Syrian Government
and all warring sides to immediately release a list
of names of all detainees, along with their current
locations and status, and immediately stop torture and
mistreatment. In the case of the death of a detainee,
a death certificate is not enough; a report on the real
cause of death and burial location must be presented to
the families.

International humanitarian organizations and the
Independent International Commission of Inquiry
on the Syrian Arab Republic must be allowed
unconditional access to detention facilities. Medical
organizations must be allowed to examine the health
situation of detainees and provide medical services
to those who need it. Those detained must be allowed
routine contact with their families. The resolution
must demand the immediate and unilateral release of
those who have been arbitrarily detained. A timetable
must be set for identifying and releasing all detained
individuals as part of any peace process, monitored by
an international independent body. We do not accept
prisoner exchanges arranged between military sides as
a replacement for a real solution to the detention crisis
in Syria. Exceptional courts, - especially field, war
and counter-terrorism courts - must be abolished and
fair trials guaranteed under United Nations supervision.

A new, peaceful Syria cannot be built while people
are still being tortured and executed. We cannot
move on without answers about our loved ones. If the
Council fails in delivering what I have called for here,
it will again fail the Syrian people and we will hold
it responsible.
