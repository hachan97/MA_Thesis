Mr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): My delegation voted
in favour of resolution 2304 (2016), as we believe
that the Security Council can no longer watch idly
the accelerating collapse of the security and political
situation in South Sudan. The enhancement of the
mandate of the United Nations Mission in South
Sudan (UNMISS) and the deployment of the Regional
Protection Force in South Sudan, as requested by the
region and consented to in principle by the Government
of South Sudan, should facilitate the establishment of
an environment conducive to the further work of the
Transitional Government of National Unity, which
is the cornerstone of the peaceful settlement of the
conflict in South Sudan.

In this regard, we look forward to the swift
deployment of and the assumption of security tasks
by the Regional Force, as mandated by the Council.
However, sustainable peace cannot be achieved
unless the South Sudanese leaders fully adhere to the
commitments they have undertaken under the peace
agreement. This includes the cessation of hostilities,
engagement and dialogue and holding accountable
those involved in gross violations and abuses of human
rights, including rape.

We urge the South Sudanese leadership to put the
well-being of their people above all other interests. As
Ukraine is one of the countries contributing troops
and police to UNMISS, it also wishes to flag its total
rejection of attacks on UNMISS personnel and premises
in South Sudan. The United Nations is there to help the
South Sudanese people. It is the people of South Sudan
who need the United Nations.

In this light, we call on the Government of South
Sudan to lift all restrictions on UNMISS operations
so as to enable the Mission effectively to carry out
its mandate.
