Mr. Mar Dieye: This is an excellent question
which touches on the crux of the matter. You know,
Madam President, that investment will just follow
where good governance, peace and security are, and
that has been lacking in the subregion. That is why our
key priority in all three countries is to ensure that
governance is restored, so that the confidence level is
high enough to attract investment. UNDP will continue
to work along these lines.
