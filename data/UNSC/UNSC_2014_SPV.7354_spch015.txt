Mrs. Perceval (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish):
Argentina believes that an explanation of its affirmative
vote is unnecessary. The history of the Palestinian
people, international law and resolutions of the United
Nations are the deepestjustification ofthe position taken
by my country. We lament that the Security Council
has not today adopted a draft resolution that sought to
express thejustice ofthe Palestinian cause. But members
of the Council must know that no resolution can block
the resolve of a people to be free and independent and,
above all, to maintain their dignity. Each one of us will
have to be responsible for the consequences ofwhat just
happened in this Chamber.
