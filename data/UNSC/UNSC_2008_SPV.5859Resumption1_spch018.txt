Mr. Mohamad (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): We
were not surprised that the representative of the Zionist
entity fled the Chamber following his attack against
my country. We were also not surprised by his baseless
allegations, which are a reflection of his moral
bankruptcy. Nor were we surprised by his reference to
Darfur, for we know of Israel's covert influence in that
region.

The comments by the representative of the
Zionist entity regarding occupied Palestine also ring
hollow. They were an attempt to cover up his country's
crimes against humanity and its violations of the rights
of the Palestinian people. The Zionist entity has
undermined the credibility of the United Nations,
which has been unable to put an end to Israel's
occupation of Palestine. That is the real tragedy.

Given the steadfastness of the Palestinian people
and of peace-loving countries, we are confident that
Palestine's independence will be achieved, just as
apartheid came to an end in South Africa. We say to the
representative of the Zionist entity: say what you like;
the fig leaf with which you clothe yourself will not
serve to hide your crimes, nor will you enjoy impunity.
