Mr. Kafando (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French):
At the outset, I would like to offer a few words of
welcome to the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of
Belgium and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as
well to welcome the presence among us today of our
colleague from Rwanda.

Unfortunately, like the picture that was painted at
our last meeting on in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, the situation in that country remains
pessimistic. Mindful of the risks of further
deterioration in the situation, my delegation supported
resolution 1843 (2008), aimed at strengthening the
capacity of the United Nations Organization Mission in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) to carry
out its mission to protect civilian populations. Based
on that same concern, my delegation this morning
supported the resolution to extend MONUC's mandate,
mindful that the provisions and measures contained in
that resolution should be able to assist in resolving the
problem, in particular in the area of civilian protection.

But through it all, we must bear in mind that the
question of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is
first of all a political one, which needs to be resolved
through political negotiations. It is therefore crucial
that the States in the region, in particular the
Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda,
intensify, as a matter of priority, their efforts to
implement the commitments that they have undertaken
under the Nairobi Communique. To that end, we urge
all actors to resolve the underlying issues that oppose
progress, in particular the threat posed by foreign and
national armed groups in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo. My delegation hopes that the
recommendations that came out of the bilateral,
regional and international initiatives that have already
been undertaken may be supported and, if possible,
upheld in the context of the new resolution that we
have just adopted.
