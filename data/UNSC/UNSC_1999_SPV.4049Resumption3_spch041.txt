Mr. Burleigh (United States of America): I
enthusiastically second what Ambassador Fowler has just
said about Ambassador Gambari and his many
contributions. Aside from identifying ourselves with all
the comments and assessments that Ambassador Fowler
made, I should like to add that Ambassador Gambari's
hard-headed pragmatism and directness have been very
much appreciated by my delegation over and through
many different issues, including most recently the
discussions about how this Council and my Government,
for example, will engage on the question of Sierra Leone
and the presence of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group
(ECOMOG) there. I want to wish him well, and I am
sure colleagues will join me in that. We will miss him.
