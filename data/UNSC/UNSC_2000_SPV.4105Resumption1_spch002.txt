Mr. Vamos-Goldman (Canada): We too thank Mr.
Bildt for his briefing and agree very much that the
solution to the problems that plague the Balkans - such
as populations displaced by war, illegal migration,
organized crime, the proliferation of small arms and light
weapons, and violations of human rights - can be found
only in a broader regional context.

Given the interactive nature and focus of this debate,
we would like to restrict ourselves to one comment and
one question from the many issues that Mr. Bildt has
briefed the Council on.

The one comment regards the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia. In our view, the United Nations walks a
delicate line between the imperative to provide for
legitimate humanitarian needs and the need to ensure that
the Government, led by an indicted war criminal, is
isolated. We noted in Mr. Bildt's recent remarks in
Sarajevo that broad sanctions against the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia have heightened corruption and criminality.
Canada believes that sanctions targeted against the regime
continue to have an important role in isolating the
Milosevic Government. In addition, if the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia wishes to benefit from regional
initiatives such as the Stability Pact, it must clearly

 

demonstrate its commitment to reform and to building a
secure, democratic society.
My question concerns Montenegro. We agree that we
need to encourage Montenegro to continue to pursue
prudently its process of democratic and economic reform.
Mr. Bildt mentioned the need for the international
community to provide financial assistance to Montenegro.
We would be interested in his ideas on how this can be
facilitated in regional initiatives such as the Stability Pact,
and how these can be used to further the gains already
made in the interests of broad regional prosperity and
stability.
