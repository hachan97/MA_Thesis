to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Serbia, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item

practice, I propose, with the consent Council, to invite
that representative to participate in the consideration of
the item, without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and Rule 37 of
