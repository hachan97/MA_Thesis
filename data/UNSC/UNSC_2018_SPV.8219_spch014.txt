Mr. Woldegerima (Ethiopia): I will be very
brief. We thank you, Mr. President, for responding to
the request for the convening of today's meeting. We
express our gratitude to Assistant Secretary-General
and Acting Under-Secretary-General for Political
Affairs Taye-Brook Zerihoun for his briefing on the
latest in the situation on the ground. What happened in
Gaza is undoubtedly tragic. We would like to raise two
or three matters at this time.

The first and most important issue is the fact that,
unless there is a return to the peace process and real
progress is made towards resolving the underlying
crisis, this kind oftragedy is bound to happen again and
again. We discussed this point earlier this week, and
we agree with what Acting Under-Secretary-General
Zerihoun said with regard to finding a sustainable
and lasting solution. In fact, the possibility of a
further deterioration of the situation cannot be ruled
out, as some have already said, and that has always
concerned us.

Secondly, we express our sorrow over the loss of
life and the wounding of many. Undoubtedly, it is a
sad day.

Thirdly, we believe that what is most important
now is for all parties to exercise self-restraint and for
the Security Council to follow the matter very closely.
