The President: It is my understanding that the
Council is ready to proceed to the adoption of the draft
annual report.

May I take it that the draft report is adopted by
the Council?

There being no objection, it is so decided.

This decision will be reflected in a note by the
President of the Security Council, to be issued as
document S/2019/666.

The meeting rose at 10.10 a.m.
