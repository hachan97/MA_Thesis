Mr. Elaraby (Egypt): Let me, at the outset, thank
the Secretary-General for his report, which contains
valuable assessments and important recommendations on
the composition, strength and, in general, the mandate of
the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force
(UNPREDEP), one of the major successes of United
Nations operations in the field of preventive diplomacy.
We agree with the Secretary-General that peace and
stability within the borders of the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia are still very dependent on
developments in the rest of the former Yugoslavia, in
particular on the degree of success that can be achieved
in implementing the General Framework Agreement for
Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

My Government welcomed the signing on 8 April
1996 of the Agreement on the Regulation of Relations
and the Promotion of Cooperation between the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, and considered that the signing
of that Agreement should not be used as an argument to

 

terminate UNPREDEP or to reduce its strength or
composition, particularly in the light of the essential role
that UNPREDEP could play in assisting the two parties in
the demarcation of their mutual borders.

At the same time, we share the assessment of the
Secretary-General following an overall evaluation of the
military and civilian components of UNPREDEP, that
replacing the current infantry units with United Nations
military observers would be detrimental to UNPREDEP'S
core function of monitoring the border.

My delegation would like to thank the sponsors of the
draft resolution, and we consider that the adoption of this
draft resolution will help in the maintenance of peace in the
former Yugoslavia and on the border with the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. My delegation will vote
in favour of the draft resolution.
