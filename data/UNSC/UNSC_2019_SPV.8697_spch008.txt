Ms. Wronecka (Poland): Poland voted in favour of
the draft resolution contained in document S/2019/96l
and we regret that we were unable to reach a consensus.
We voted in favour to express our strong support
for the renewal of the mechanism, which enables
humanitarian supplies to cross into Syria, provides
aid to those in urgent need and supports basic service
delivery. Without it, it would be impossible to ensure
lifesaving assistance for millions and reach those in
need. I would like to thank the Belgium, Germany and
Kuwait co-penholders for their tireless efforts during
the negotiations.
