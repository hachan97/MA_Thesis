The President: It is my pleasure to warmly
welcome the extraordinary turnout of Ministers and
other representatives present in the Security Council
Chamber. The participation here today and the number
of people who have travelled from afar - some of
whom, like Laurent Fabius, are going to turn around, go
right back and then come back again - and the extent of
the dedication of so many in being here, given the press
of business for everyone in the Chamber, is a statement
in and of itself about the importance of the matter under
discussion. We are therefore deeply grateful, not just
for the response to our invitation but to all the countries
that have understood the responsibility and seriousness
of this moment. We thank everyone heartily.

In accordance with rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure, I invite the
representatives of Albania, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada,
Denmark, Egypt, Finland, Germany, Georgia, Iraq, the
Islamic Republic of Iran, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, the
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Poland,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Spain, the Syrian Arab Republic,
Turkey and the United Arab Emirates to participate in
this meeting.

In accordance with rule 39 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure, I invite Mr. Nickolay
Mladenov, Special Representative of the Secretary-
General and Head of the United Nations Assistance
Mission for Iraq, to participate in this meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

I give the floor to Mr. Mladenov.
