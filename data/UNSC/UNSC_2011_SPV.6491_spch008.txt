Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation supported Security
Council resolution 1970 (2011) because of our serious
concern over the events taking place in Libya. We
sincerely regret the many lives lost among the civilian
population. We condemn the use of military force
against peaceful demonstrators and all other
manifestations of violence and consider them
absolutely unacceptable. We call for an immediate end
to such actions.

We exhort the Libyan authorities to comply with
the demands of the international community, including
the League of Arab States and the African Union,
which demands have received the support of the
Security Council. This is necessary in order to prevent
a full-scale civil war and to preserve Libya as a united,
sovereign State with territorial integrity.

All the parties involved must show restraint and
observe the norms of international civil and human
rights law. Reliable security must be ensured for those
foreigners who remain in Libya, including Russian
citizens, and conditions for their safe return home must
be established.

A settlement of the situation in Libya is possible
only through political means. In fact, that is the
purpose of the resolution adopted by the Council,
which imposes targeted, clearly expressed, restrictive
measures with regard to those guilty of violence
against the civilian population. However, it does not
enjoin sanctions, even indirect, for forceful
interference in Libya's affairs, which could make the
situation worse.

Russia, in cooperation with international and
regional partners, will continue actively to help the
friendly people of Libya to find a peaceful way out of
the current crisis.
