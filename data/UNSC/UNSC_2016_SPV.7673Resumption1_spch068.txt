Mr. Abdul Razak (Malaysia): I take the floor,
unfortunately, to respond to the statement made by my
colleague from Israel.

First, my delegation categorically rejects the
allegations made. They serve no other purpose than to
divert the Security Council's attention from the real

matter at hand, which is the continuing situation in
Palestine, which is under occupation by Israel.

Malaysia's position on Palestine is based on the
values and principles of the Charter of the United
Nations, international law, including international
human rights law and humanitarian law, as well as the
various resolutions of the United Nations, including
those of the Security Council. Yet Israel continues to
completely and flagrantly disregard international law
and disrespects international human rights standards.
Israel is in violation of countless resolutions and
decisions of the Council, the General Assembly, the
Human Rights Council and even the International
Court of Justice. Its lack of cooperation with United
Nations human-rights mechanisms, is described in
detail in the latest report (A/HRC/3l/73) of the Special
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the
Palestinian territories.

With regard to terrorism, Malaysia's long-standing
position is to condemn all acts of terror and the killing
of civilians, regardless of whether the victims are
Israelis or Palestinians. It is, however, unfortunate that
terrorism has become a convenient narrative that Israel
uses to portray itself as a victim, cover up its illegal
actions and mask its intention to destroy the possibility
of a two-State solution. We urge the Israeli delegation
to focus its energies on addressing the various concerns
raised by my delegation and other Member States today,
rather than attempting to divert our attention.

The meeting rose at 6.45 pm.
