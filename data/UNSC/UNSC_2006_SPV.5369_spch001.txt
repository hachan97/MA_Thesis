The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Afghanistan in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In accordance with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Farhddi
(Afghanistan) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Jean-Marie
Guehenno, Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping
Operations.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Guehenno to take a seat at the
Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of the members
of the Council to the following documents: S/2006/89,
which contains a letter dated 9 February 2006 from the
representative of Afghanistan; and photocopies of a
letter dated 9 February 2006 from the representative of
Afghanistan, transmitting a copy of the Afghanistan
Compact adopted at the conclusion of the international
London Conference on Afghanistan, which will be
issued as a document of the Council under the symbol
S/2006/90.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno, Under-
Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations. I give
him the floor.
