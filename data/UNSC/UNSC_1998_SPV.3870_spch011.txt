Mr. Amolo (Kenya): The Kenya delegation joins the
consensus in support of today's draft resolution, whose
aim is to reactivate the International Commission of
Inquiry on illegal arms flows to Rwanda. We do this in
the belief that there are justifiable grounds to do so,
namely to permit the Commission to follow up its earlier,
inconclusive, investigations and to report to the Security
Council on its findings with appropriate recommendations.
We believe that the Commission should be able to
complete all its investigations and other pending matters
within the time-frame stipulated in the draft resolution,
and to wind up its work.

We are, of course, aware that since the
Commission's final report, submitted in November 1996,
the situation in the Great Lakes region has assumed a new
and more complex dimension involving a new theatre of
activities and a wide range of players. The reality on the
ground cannot be ignored, and it is our hope that any
measures recommended by the Commission will be
comprehensive enough to contribute meaningfully to the
stabilization of the region and to finding a long-term
solution to other problems which are fuelled by the
proliferation of weapons.
