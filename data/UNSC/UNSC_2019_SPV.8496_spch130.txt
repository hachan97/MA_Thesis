Mr. Kuzmin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): It is late, so I will not take much of the
Council members' time. I simply wish to comment on
the statement made by the representative of Ukraine.

He once again told the old tall tale about Russian
aggression, but among other things he accused my
country of violating the International Convention
for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. In
that regard, I would simply recall the decision of the
International Court of Justice from 19 April 2017, on
the case of Ukraine v. Russian Federation, as it applies
to the Convention. The decision stated that Ukraine's
claims in that connection were not plausible.

I will not comment on the other issues that the
representative of Ukraine touched upon because they
are totally unrelated to the topic of today's meeting. I
am very sorry that the delegation of Ukraine continues
to use the Security Council platform to spread
its propaganda.
