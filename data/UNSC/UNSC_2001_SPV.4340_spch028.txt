The President: I thank Mr. Adeniji for his
remarks and for his responses to the points raised
during the debate. I believe that those responses will be
very useful for members and others who participated in
this debate, to help them understand the situation in

Sierra Leone and the activities of the United Nations
Mission in Sierra Leone.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Council has thus concluded the present stage of it
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 1.40 pm.
