Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese):
Currently, Security Council members still have grave
concerns about the draft resolution to commemorate
the Srebrenica event (S/2015/508). To force a vote on a
draft resolution on which major differences still remain
is not in conformity with national reconciliation within
Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the region at large. It
will also affect the unity ofthe members of the Council.
China believes that the Council members can continue
their exchange of views on the draft resolution, but
should refrain from hasty actions.
