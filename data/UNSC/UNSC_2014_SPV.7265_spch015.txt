Mr. Oyarzabal (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish):
At the outset, through you, Madam President, I would
like to begin by thanking Ambassador Quinlan for
presenting the quarterly report on the work of the
Committee established pursuant to resolution 1737
(2006) and, as always, for his dedicated work at the
head of that subsidiary body.

We have received the final report of the Director
General of the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) on the implementation by Iran of its Safeguards
Agreement under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons. We underscore that the report
acknowledges that Iran has implemented two of the
five measures agreed with the Agency in May under
the cooperation framework with the IAEA and two
additional measures after the established deadline. We
also note that the report points out that, in the reporting
period, Iran did not enrich uranium above 5 per cent
and that, following reconversion processes, it no longer
has a stock of 20-per cent enriched uranium.

Like the other members of the international
community, we are following developments in the
negotiations between the P5+1 and Iran very closely. We
find the willingness shown by all parties encouraging
and hope that a final agreement can be reached by the
new agreed deadline of November. Once again, we are
pleased that trust has again been placed in the IAEA so
that it may carry out its nuclear energy monitoring and
verification activities in relation to the implementation
of the Joint Plan of Action.

In conclusion, we welcome the progress in the
negotiations. We note the conclusion of the Director
General of IAEA with regard to Iran's strong
commitment to implementing the Joint Plan of Action.
At the same time, we reiterate our continued belief that
Iran must meet its obligations, including the Council
resolutions, and actively cooperate with the Agency on
all outstanding issues.
