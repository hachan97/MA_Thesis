The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council will now proceed to the consideration of its
annual report to the General Assembly, for the period
from 1 August 2005 to 31 July 2006.

The introduction to the draft report was prepared
by the delegation of France and the factual contents
were prepared by the Secretariat. I should like to
express my appreciation to the delegation of France
and to the Secretariat for the work they have
undertaken in preparing their respective contributions.

I should like to point out that the format of the
draft report now before us corresponds to the
provisions initially set out in the note by the President
of 22 May 2002 (S/2002/ 199) and now incorporated in
the note by the President of 19 July 2006 (S/2006/507).

I now call on Mr. Tuliameni Kalomoh, Assistant
Secretary-General for Political Affairs, to make an
explanatory statement.
