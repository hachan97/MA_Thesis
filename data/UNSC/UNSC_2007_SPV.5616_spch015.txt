Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese):
First of all, I should like to thank the representative of
Germany and Mr. Solana for their respective briefings.
I wish also to thank Mr. Gue'henno and Mr. Gambari
for their briefings.

China wishes to congratulate the Democratic
Republic of the Congo for the successful holding of the
elections there. China expresses its appreciation to the
European Union-led peacekeeping force (EUFOR) for
the assistance it provided to the United Nations
Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (MONUC) in the accomplishment of parts

of MONUC's mandate in the general elections. We
deem highly positive the constructive role played by
EUFOR in the maintenance of peace and security in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Although EUFOR's mandate has expired, we
hope that the EU will continue to support the
democratic process in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, actively provide economic assistance and help
the new Government in carrying out security sector
reform, so as to make a new round of contributions to
the achievement of durable peace and security in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo is
actively engaged in the formation of a new
Government, and post-conflict reconstruction will soon
be under way. The international community must
devote the necessary attention to the Democratic
Republic of the Congo. China is in favour of
MONUC's continuing to play an important role in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo so that the very
fragile peace there can be maintained. China will also
continue to provide the necessary assistance to the
Democratic Republic of the Congo so as to play its part
in the peaceful reconstruction of the country.
