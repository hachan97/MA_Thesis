Mr. MacKay (New Zealand): New Zealanders
are dismayed at the continuation of violence in Israel
and the occupied territories. It is clear from over half a
century of conflict that neither violence nor repression
holds any hope for creating peace and security.

New Zealand firmly condemns all terrorist
actions. The targeting of civilians promotes fear and
hatred. It is for that reason that we urge both sides to
refrain from such actions and that we urge Israel to lift
its siege on the towns of the occupied territories. Just
as terrorist bombs hurt indiscriminately, so too do the
restrictions on the movements of ordinary Palestinians.
The blockade of the Palestinian population is
disproportionate to the threat Israel faces, and it cannot
provide the security that Israel seeks. Instead, it will
simply provide more fertile ground in which extremist
groups can seek to expand their destructive causes.

We also urge Israel to release the tax payments
due to the Palestinian Authority. The withholding of
those funds, combined with the economic effects of the
closure of Gaza and the West Bank, has caused a dire
situation in the occupied territories. The loss of work
and hope only increases the desperation of the
Palestinian population. All conflict has an economic
and social dimension, and the destruction of the
Palestinian economy serves no one, but greatly
increases human suffering.

New Zealand calls on the leaders of both parties
to find a way past the distrust and to work together to
provide a Viable future for both their peoples.
