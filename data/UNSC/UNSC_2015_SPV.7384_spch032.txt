Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I would very much like to have left the last
word to my Lithuanian colleague; I would have loved
to, ifI could. I am probably abusing my speaking time,
but after what she said I cannot help but respond with
a couple of words. "Capitulate one's territory." Has the
full meaning ofthe Minsk agreements been understood?
Everything that we are talking about concerns the
reintegration of Ukraine. How significant is it where
the line is drawn in such conditions?

In recent months, the problem has been that the
Ukrainian security forces have been shelling towns.
They had to be pushed back from Donetsk so that they
could not shell the cities. But with all that bloodshed, if
Ukraine is to be reintegrated, is there a desire to draw
a new State borderline? In that case, let us draw a new
State borderline and then we can address that issue.

Now, as to the issue of weapons, Lithuania is, I
believe, the only State that has sincerely and officially
stated that it is supplying weapons to Kyiv. Perhaps
the militia could also be provided with some of those
Lithuanian weapons?
