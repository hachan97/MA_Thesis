Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I think it is obvious
why we voted against the draft resolution. We support
completely what the French representative laid out
about next steps and we will work tirelessly to that
objective, along with partners on the Council.

The Russian Ambassador referred to myths. These
are not our myths. The way forward in the Council has
been blocked. The second of our own criteria for taking
this action on an exceptional basis must be objectively
clear. There is no practicable alternative to the use of
force iflives are to be saved. In the 113 meetings of the
Council on Syria, I think that has been demonstrated
absolutely crystally clear. The United Kingdom believes
that it cannot be illegal to prevent the use of force to
save lives in such numbers as we have seen in Syria.
The reason we took this action - our legal basis - was
that of humanitarian intervention. We believe that that
is wholly within the principles and purposes of the
United Nations.
