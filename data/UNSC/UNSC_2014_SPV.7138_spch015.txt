Mr. Cherif (Chad) (spoke in French): Since the
beginning ofthe Ukrainian crisis, Chad has consistently
expressed its commitment to the territorial integrity
and unity of Ukraine, in accordance with the Charter
of the United Nations. The intangibility of borders
and territorial integrity of States is a sacred principle
set forth in the Constitutive Act of the African Union.
Chad's vote in favour of the draft resolution contained
in document S/2014/ 189 reflects that commitment.

Chad takes note with great concern the persistence
of the escalation of the crisis in Ukraine, which
is taking place despite the repeated appeals of the
international community, and particularly the Security
Council, for restraint and calm. We believe that it is
still possible for the parties to open the way towards
national reconciliation and maintaining Ukraine's unity
by engaging in inclusive dialogue among the various
components with respect for diversity, human rights
and in particular the rights of minorities.

Chad reiterates its call for respect for territorial
integrity, the non-use of force and the peaceful
settlement of disputes, in accordance with the Charter
of the United Nations.

Also, we would like to once again call for calm and
restraint. We believe that the solution to the crisis can
only be a political and negotiated one.
