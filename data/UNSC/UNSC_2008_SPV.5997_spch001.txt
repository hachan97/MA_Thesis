The President (spoke in Chinese): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Bangladesh, El Salvador,
Guinea-Bissau, the Netherlands, Norway and Sierra
Leone, in which they request to be invited to
participate in the consideration of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, the
representatives of the aforementioned countries
took the seats reserved for them at the side of the
Council Chamber.

The President (spoke in Chinese): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to His Excellency
Mr. Yukio Takasu, Chair of the Peacebuilding
Commission and Permanent Representative of Japan.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Takasu to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/4l7, which contains the report of the
Peacebuilding Commission on its second session.
I now give the floor to Mr. Yukio Takasu, Chair
of the Peacebuilding Commission and Permanent
Representative of Japan.
