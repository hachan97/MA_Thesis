Ms. Wolcott (United States of America): It has
been a long and productive session today. I just wanted
to add briefly that, contrary to statements we have
heard, the United States has taken a number of actions
with respect to Luis Posada Carriles consistent with
international law, as well as our domestic legal
framework, that provide for due process and various
constitutional safeguards. We have recounted these
aspects on numerous occasions, in fact, I have done so
myself, including in this chamber. I will not repeat this
entire history today. But I will just state the following
recent updates.

The United States sought and obtained a criminal
indictment charging Posada with violations of our
immigration laws. The Federal District Court, a part of
the United States independent judiciary handling that
case, recently dismissed the indictment. The United
States filed a notice appealing the Court's decision on
5 June 2007. Posada remains under investigation for
past activities.

In the meantime, Posada remains subject to the
Order of Removal issued by the Immigration Judge and
is without legal status in the United States. He is also
subject to an Order of Supervision from the
Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and
Customs Enforcement, which imposes certain
restrictions on Posada, including reporting and
monitoring requirements.

In sum, the United States continues to be engaged
in an ongoing series of actions consistent with our
legal requirements and due process with respect to
Posada.
