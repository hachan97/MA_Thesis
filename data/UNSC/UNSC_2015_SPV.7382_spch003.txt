Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): We
welcome the unanimous adoption of resolution 2201
(2015). It was clear at the open briefing earlier this
week (see S/PV.7381) that the world was waiting for a
powerful message from the Security Council in response
to recent developments in Yemen. Today, we have made
clear that those who use Violence and intimidation to try
to dictate Yemen's future are undermining the security
of all Yemeni citizens and eroding the political progress
made since 2011. The Houthis must take responsibility
for their actions and stop using violence and coercion
as political tools. They must ensure the immediate and
safe release of President Hadi Mansour, Prime Minister
Bahah and members of the Cabinet from house arrest.

There can be no doubt that the principles underlying
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Initiative, the
National Dialogue and last September's Peace and
National Partnership Agreement are the only legitimate
road map for Yemen's transition. The Council has sent
a clear message today that all parties in Yemen, and
especially the Houthis, need to pull back from the
brink and implement these commitments on a swift and
inclusive basis.

I would like to express my appreciation for the
continued work of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-
General, Mr. Jamal Benomar, and call on the Houthis
and on all parties to engage in good faith in United
Nations-brokered negotiations. The Council has once
again spoken in one voice and delivered a strong and
unified message. I would like to thank Jordan and all
delegations for their support and flexibility in agreeing
this important resolution. I am particularly grateful
for the close and productive consultations that Jordan
and the United Kingdom have enjoyed with the GCC,
Their leadership on this issue so close to their borders
is critically important.
