Mr. Pleuger (Germany): Our position with regard
to the solution of the Middle East conflict is well
known; I do not have to repeat it here. I just wanted to
say that we tried to introduce into the draft resolution a
number of amendments that were important to my
delegation and to my Government. We did not succeed
in getting them in, and we therefore have to abstain on
the resolution.
