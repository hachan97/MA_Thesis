Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): The
United Kingdom welcomes the unanimous adoption of
resolution 2216 (2015).

In February, the Security Council made it very
clear that further measures would be taken if the
Houthis failed to cease their intimidation, aggression
and expansion. As their actions have shown, the
Houthis ignored this warning. The United Kingdom
therefore supports the Saudi-led military intervention
in Yemen taking place at the request of President Hadi,
but ultimately the solution to this crisis must be a
political one, and the United Kingdom stands with the
international community in its call in this resolution for
an inclusive political process.

We call on all Yemeni parties to engage in the United
Nations-led dialogue in good faith. This resolution
adopts sanctions against individuals who have chosen
not to do so but instead continue to destabilize Yemen.
It is right that the international community increase the
cost of their unacceptable behaviour.

A political solution in Yemen remains the best way
to counter the growing threat from terrorist groups such
as Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. It is imperative
that the international community not lose sight of the
growing threat that they pose. A political solution is
also the best way to arrest the worsening economic and
humanitarian situation. Free and unfettered access for
humanitarian supplies is critical. The United Kingdom
is providing additional humanitarian support to Yemen
and we urge the international community to do likewise.

The security and stability of Yemen is in the interest
of all Yemenis and all in the international community.
It is right that the Security Council has taken this action
today and the United Kingdom will continue to use all
of the tools at our disposal to support a lasting political
solution in Yemen.
