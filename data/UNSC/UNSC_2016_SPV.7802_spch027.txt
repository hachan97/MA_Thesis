Mr. Vitrenko (Ukraine): Out of respect for the
presidency, other delegations around the table and
the broader membership, I will be very brief and
will not engage in a debate with the delegation of an
aggressor State.

Let me just quickly react to one point usually used
by the Russian delegation, that is, that issues raised by
Ukraine are not relevant to this or that particular agenda
item in a Security Council debate. Asymmetrical or
hybrid threats are exactly what the Russian Federation
presents to the world today, not only to Ukraine. The
agenda item we are discussing today is "Maintenance
of international peace and security". As my Minister
pointed out in his statement, already more than 10,000
people have been killed in Ukraine, and more than
20,000 persons have been wounded, as a direct result
of the Russian aggression against my country. If that
is not a threat to international peace and security, then
what is?

Finally, let each and every State Member of the
United Nations decide who deserves to serve on the
Council and who does not. Should an aggressor State sit
on the Council, or should the victim of the aggression?
We think that the States Members of the United Nations

have already provided us with that answer when they
elected Ukraine last year by an overwhelming majority
to serve in the Council for two years, unlike the Russian
Federation, which became a member of the Security
Council in 1991 in an unclear and opaque procedure.
