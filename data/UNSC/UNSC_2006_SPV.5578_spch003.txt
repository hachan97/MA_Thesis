The President (spoke in Arabic): May I take it
that the draft report is adopted by the Council?

There being no objection, it is so decided.

This decision will be reflected in a note by the
President of the Security Council to be issued as
document S/2006/942.

The Security Council has thus concluded its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
