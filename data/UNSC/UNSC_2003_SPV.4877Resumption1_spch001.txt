The President (spoke in French): I would remind
representatives that, in order to optimize the use of our
time, I will not individually invite speakers to take
seats at the table. When a speaker is taking the floor,
the Conference Officer will seat the next speaker on the
list at the Council table.

The first speaker on my list is the Permanent
Representative of Japan, to whom I give the floor.
