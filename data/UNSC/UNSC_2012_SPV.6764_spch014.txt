Mr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish):
Guatemala joins the consensus in favour of resolution
2046 (2012). For months now, we have noted with
growing alarm the collision course taken by the Sudan
and South Sudan, in violation of the spirit and the letter
of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed by both
countries. We are convinced that both parties have their
share of responsibility in the succession of irrational
actions that have been taken to the detriment of the
interests of both parties and that presage an increasing
risk of the resumption of an armed conflict that we had
thought to have ended in July 2011.

In voting in favour the resolution, we were not
only responding to the appeal that has been made by
the African Union, but also fulfilling the role assigned
to us by the Charter of the United Nations, since no
one can deny that international peace and security are
in jeopardy. We trust that, with the adoption of today's
resolution, peace between the Sudan and South Sudan
will embrace the new opportunity to implement all
elements of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.

We welcome the fact that the Security Council
has again joined the African Union and its road map
for peace between the Sudan and South Sudan. That
makes it possible for us to support the peoples and the
Governments of the Sudan and of South Sudan in the
process of achieving a firm and lasting peace within a
framework of cooperation between both countries.
