Mr. Manongi (United Republic of Tanzania): We
too want to thank the United States for joining us in
sponsoring this resolution and for contributing to its
support.

It is not a perfect resolution. It does not offer all
the answers to the challenges facing Somalia. It is,
however, a step in the right direction - a step that
needed to be taken. It encourages all of Somalia's
parties to work together towards the restoration of
peace and security in Somalia. This is as it ought to be.
Furthermore, the resolution responds, to a degree, to
the concerns raised by the Intergovernmental Authority
on Development (IGAD) and the African Union.

It is clear that both IGAD and the African Union
will continue to need the support not only of this
Council, but also of the international community in
supporting Somalia as it walks towards this tenuous
road to peace and stability. We are glad to associate
ourselves with the resolution and we thank the Council
for having adopted it.
