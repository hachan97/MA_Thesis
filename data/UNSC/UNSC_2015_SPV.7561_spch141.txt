Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Today's debate featured many speakers
discussing many different things, and that has only
strengthened our conviction that the Security Council is
not the place to examine this issue. On top of that, some
delegations attempted, with a persistence worthy of a
better aim, to use the forum of the Council to express
views that have no relation to today's discussion in
order to promote their national agendas, particularly
the Ukrainian delegation. If the topic of the conflict
in Donbas is to be raised, it is worth recalling the
overthrow of the State in 2014, which was achieved
with the support of a number of Western States and
which began with bloodshed in Kyiv, and subsequently
in other parts of the country as well. I would like to
recommend to the Ukrainian delegation, which will be
taking a seat on the Security Council next year, that
they learn to restrict themselves to the subject under
discussion and not to put on a political performance on
the same issue every time.
