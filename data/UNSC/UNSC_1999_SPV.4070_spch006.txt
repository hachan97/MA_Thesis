Mr. Fowler (Canada): We too support the draft
resolution before the Council today, because we wish to
give the negotiations that are under way on a
comprehensive omnibus draft resolution additional time to
succeed. For over a year, the Council has failed in its
responsibility to deal effectively with the Iraq problem,
and a new comprehensive omnibus resolution would
finally allow us to resume weapons inspections while
providing effective humanitarian relief to the people of
Iraq.

We do not think that these matters can be easily or
usefully separated. A comprehensive draft resolution will
involve many difficult compromises, but we believe that

 

the chances of its adoption would be considerably lessened
if we looked at one or another element in isolation in the
current circumstances. We therefore believe that we should
give the negotiations every chance to succeed, and we
would urge the five permanent members of the Council to
resume those negotiations with a view to concluding them
just as quickly as possible.
