Mr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): I, too, would like to welcome the presence at
this meeting of the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan.
The Syrian Arab Republic joined the Security Council
consensus and voted in favour of resolution 1511
(2003). We did so after consultations with the
representatives of France, Russia, Germany and China
and with the representatives of the other States elected
to the Council, and after contacts between my country
and countries with which we have relations of
friendship and cooperation, among them Japan.

Even though the resolution does not respond to
all our expectations, which are closely linked to the
aspirations of the Iraqi people to freedom and
independence, we hope that the resolution will
represent an incentive and a further step along that road
and that the commitments set out in the resolution will
be fulfilled in order to accelerate the transfer of
sovereignty to the Iraqis, with a view to the adoption of
a constitution and the formation of an internationally
recognized elected and representative Government. We
hope too that the resolution will promote the role of the
United Nations and the Secretary-General, especially
because the stability of the situation in Iraq and the
safeguarding of its sovereignty and territorial integrity
are very important to Syria and other neighbouring
countries and will have a positive impact on the
situation in the region.

Syria will continue to make every possible effort
to respond to the needs of the Iraqi people and will
endeavour to alleviate their suffering and provide them
with what they need for stability and security.
