Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I do not intend to engage in polemics, but we
need to get to the bottom of the statistics with regard
to the number of people in Syria who have access to
humanitarian assistance and people who have received
assistance from the United Nations. Ithink that this is one
of the challenges that the new Under-Secretary-General
will have to deal with. I remember the last time we
discussed the matter of Syria and humanitarian access
in the Consultations Room with a representative of the
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(OCHA), who provided us with compelling data on the
number of people receiving humanitarian assistance.
Thanks to assistance provided by the Government of
the Syrian Arab Republic - unless I am mistaken - it
is not hundreds of thousands, but 5 million people who
received assistance thanks to OCHA cooperation with
the Syrian Government. I do not wish to dispute the
figures, but I would like us to get to the bottom of the
statistics. I would ask that Mr. Lowcock address this
matter. Let us, so to speak, synchronize our watches on
this issue.
