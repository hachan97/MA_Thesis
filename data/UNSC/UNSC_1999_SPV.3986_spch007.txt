Mr. van Walsum (Netherlands): I join previous
speakers, as well as yourself, Mr. President, in expressing
my country's sadness at the passing of His Highness
Shaikh Isa, Amir of Bahrain.

The Netherlands will vote in favour of the draft
resolution on Sierra Leone, which enables the United
Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL)
to continue to play its key role in the peace process, in
tandem with the efforts of the Economic Community of
West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to
restore peace and security in Sierra Leone.

The situation in that country continues to be volatile.
Accordingly, a credible military presence should be
maintained in order to allow the parties involved -
Government and rebels alike - to use the present
window of opportunity to enter into a dialogue and work
towards a peaceful solution. The Netherlands welcomes
the signals from both sides which seem to indicate an
interest in pursuing such a dialogue. We urge the parties
to enter into talks without delay.

We further wish to commend the efforts of
ECOMOG, and in particular the countries that contribute
to its present strength, for their perseverance in creating
conditions for a peaceful settlement. It should be clear

 

that these troop-contributing countries do not stand alone.
They deserve our strong support. In the case of the
Netherlands, this support has so far consisted of $4 million
for the ECOMOG operations plus $2 million for
humanitarian assistance.

Meanwhile, let us not lose sight of the real victims of
the conflict: the thousands of innocent civilians killed,
wounded or maimed for life, who deserve more than just
our compassion. They are in desperate need of aid and
relief. We call, therefore, upon both parties to cooperate
fully with the humanitarian organizations and to allow them
to reach these victims without any hindrance.
