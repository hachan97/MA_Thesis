The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank Sir
Jeremy Greenstock for his comprehensive briefing and
for his leadership, which has laid a good basis for the
future work of this Committee.

To enable us to conduct this meeting as
efficiently as possible, I would request that statements
be limited to seven minutes. The presidency intends to
conclude the morning meeting at 1.10 at the latest. If
necessary, we will continue after lunch.
