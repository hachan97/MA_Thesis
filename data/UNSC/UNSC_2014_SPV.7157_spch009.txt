Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
thank Assistant Secretary-General Simonovie for his
briefing. China is deeply concerned about the recent
escalation of the situation in Ukraine. We hope that all
parties can remain calm, exercise restraint and prevent
a further deterioration of the situation. The priority
now is to work within the framework of law to resolve
differences through dialogue and negotiation, with
full consideration of the legitimate rights, interests
and aspirations of all regions and ethnic communities.
That is the only approach that can bring lasting peace
and stability to Ukraine, in keeping with the long-term
fundamental interests of the nation as a whole and all
of its communities.

China views the issue of Ukraine as highly
complex and believes that the only solution is to
remain on the path to a political settlement, which
requires a favourable external environment. China has
been calling on the international community to work
constructively through its good offices to de-escalate
the situation in Ukraine. China has put forward a
three-point proposal on seeking a political solution to
the Ukrainian issue. We have taken note of the ongoing
discussion on establishing a multilateral mechanism
for dialogue. China welcomes those efforts, which are
largely in line with the Chinese proposal.

China supports the early launch of dialogue and
consultations among the relevant parties, based on full
consideration and accommodation of all legitimate
interests and concerns in order to find a definitive
solution that is acceptable to all.
