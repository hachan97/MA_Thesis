Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): I am
grateful to Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his
briefing.

The United Kingdom requested this meeting
because we are deeply concerned by the deteriorating
security situation in southern and eastern Ukraine and
by the fact that the Geneva agreement of 17 April is
not yet achieving its objective to restore stability in
Ukraine. It is vitally important that the Security Council
maintain its close scrutiny of events in Ukraine and the
consequent threat to international peace and security.

We will doubtless hear Russian claims that it is
the actions of the Ukrainian Government that are
destabilizing the south and east of the country. In
fact, it is Russia that has taken further dangerous
steps aimed at fomenting instability in Ukraine. It has
directed paramilitary actions in Sloviansk, Kramatorsk,
Lugansk and other towns in eastern Ukraine. Russian
military jets and helicopters have made incursions
into Ukrainian airspace. Russian armed forces have
held further military exercises on Ukraine's border.
These are all clear attempts to escalate tensions within
Ukraine.

These steps have been matched with intensified
rhetoric. The Permanent Representative of the Russian
Federation has asserted that Russia has a legal basis
to intervene in Ukraine in accordance with the right
of self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter of the
United Nations. This is a claim that takes Russia's
distortion of international law to a new level. There is
no justification or legal basis whatsoever for invoking
Article 51. Russian nationals are not under threat in
Ukraine - a fact that has been reaffirmed on numerous
occasions, including by the United Nations Human
Rights Monitoring Mission and by the Commissioner
for National Minorities of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). This is
deeply irresponsible rhetoric intended to threaten and
intimidate the Ukrainian Government and provide a
bogus pretext for further illegal breaches of Ukrainian
sovereignty and territorial integrity.

As a result of Russia's activities, there has been a
further marked deterioration in the security situation in
eastern and southern Ukraine, as Mr. Feltman has just
said. The United Kingdom condemns the abduction
at gunpoint and public parading of an OSCE Vienna
Document inspection team and its Ukrainian escorts.
We call upon those responsible to ensure the safe
treatment and immediate release of the team, and we
urge Russia, itselfan OSCE member, to use its influence
to ensure that this happens without further delay.
On 17 April, talks between Ukraine, Russia, the
United States and the European Union succeeded in
agreeing steps to reduce tensions. The United Kingdom
welcomed that agreement and the opportunity it offered
for restoring stability in Ukraine. But this opportunity
has been spurned. Since 17 April, the actions undertaken
by Kyiv and Moscow stand in stark contrast. Let us
consider the facts.

First, the Geneva agreement called for all sides to
refrain from violence, intimidation and provocative
actions. For its part, the Ukrainian Government has
acted with commendable restraint when undertaking
measured and proportionate security operations to deal
with armed groups illegally occupying Government
buildings and forming checkpoints. The Ukrainian
Government has the right and responsibility to uphold
the rule of law and protect both its citizens and its
officials on Ukrainian territory. Russia, on the other
hand, continues its military manoeuvres and aggressive
rhetoric.

Secondly, the agreement called for all illegal armed
groups to be disarmed. The Ukrainian Government
started to collect illegal weapons almost as soon as
it came to power. There are now no illegally armed
protesters on Maidan Square and no armed self-defence
groups patrolling the streets of Kyiv. But in Sloviansk
and other eastern cities, we continue to see, encouraged
by Russia, heavily armed paramilitary forces armed
with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades.

Thirdly, the agreement called for all illegally
seized buildings, occupied streets and public places
to be vacated. The Ukrainian Government has been
systematically and incrementally removing barricades
around the Maidan and the protests there are gradually
shrinking. By contrast, Russia has refused to use its
influence to restrain armed groups in the east. In fact,
Foreign Minister Lavrov stated on 23 April that Russia
will not call for these illegal militias to put down their
arms and vacate buildings. Instead, barricades and
roadblocks in eastern and southern Ukraine have been
steadily reinforced.

Furthermore, while Ukraine has put a draft law to
the Ukrainian Parliament that would provide amnesty
for protestors who vacate Government buildings and
lay down their weapons, Russia has not rescinded the
order by the Russian Parliament to authorize the use
of military force in Ukraine and will not condemn the
widely reported abuses by pro-Russian armed groups
in southern and eastern Ukraine. These abuses include
at least 11 kidnappings, among them several Ukrainian
and international journalists, and the torture and
murder ofa Ukrainian local official and two other local
people. The deplorable shooting yesterday of the Mayor
of Kharkiv was another sign of the violence being
instigated against those who have opted to support a
united Ukraine.

Finally, Ukraine has begun an inclusive process of
constitutional reform on the decentralization of power.
It has announced measures to guarantee the protection
of the Russian language, and it has condemned
instances of anti-Semitism and xenophobia, whereas
Russian rhetoric continues to whip up tensions with
false claims that the Russian language is under threat
in Ukraine and allegations that the Kyiv Government
is anti-Semitic.

When one lays out the facts, they cut through
the fiction of Russian propaganda. Having illegally
annexed Crimea, Russia is now destabilizing southern
and eastern Ukraine as part of its plan to undermine the
ability of the people of Ukraine to determine peacefully
their own future. In doing so, it is threatening
international peace and security. But the doors of
diplomacy remain open. We urge Russia to abandon the
dangerous course it is pursuing and to take urgent steps
to implement the Geneva agreement.

In the extremely difficult circumstances which
now confront it, the Ukrainian Government is striving
to take forward a programme of democratization and
inclusive constitutional and economic reform that
aims to correct the long period of misgovernment and
corruption that preceded it. It is in all our interests to
support this process. This is not about zero-sum game
politics; it is about restoring stability to Ukraine and to
the wider region and allowing all the people of Ukraine
to determine their own future. We urge Russia to
become part of this collective international effort.
