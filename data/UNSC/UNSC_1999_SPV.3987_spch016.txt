President Clinton has made our position clear: The
United States would consider supporting a peacekeeping
operation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo if
there were a comprehensive agreement among the
belligerents to end the conflict and to observe a ceasefire.
Any monitoring force should be limited in size; its
mandate should be to observe and monitor, not to enforce
the peace or to maintain the security of the Congo's
borders.

An internal Congolese dialogue is essential. A sound
political process must be inclusive and open and have the
confidence of all Congolese. By helping develop such a
process, the Organization of African Unity and the United
Nations can play an important role in building a stable,
peaceful path to democracy and national reconciliation in
the Congo.
