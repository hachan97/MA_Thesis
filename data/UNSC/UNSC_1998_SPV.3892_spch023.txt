Mr. Mahugu (Kenya): The United Nations Mission in
Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH) has contributed
significantly to the progress in the peace process in Bosnia
and Herzegovina. As one of the participating countries,
Kenya is proud to be associated with that process. The
Mission's activities of monitoring, advising and training the
local police have had a very positive effect, inter alia, in
creating an atmosphere conducive to freedom of movement.
The introduction of a common license plate, which has
brought about a fundamental change towards increased
freedom of movement, is a case in point.

While welcoming these positive developments, my
delegation is concerned that violent incidents directed at
returning refugees and displaced persons have been on the
increase in the last three months. We call upon all the
parties to take advantage of the United Nations presence in
order to consolidate peace and reconciliation in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.

My delegation has always reiterated that economic
development is an integral part of any peace process. In this
regard, we commend the efforts of the United Nations
system and the World Bank in trying to bring about
progress in major sectors of the economy. Although much
has been achieved, much more remains to be done. The
support of the international community, therefore, remains
necessary for Bosnia and Herzegovina to consolidate the
progress made so far.

Finally, my delegation supports the recommendation
of the Secretary-General that the mandate of UNMIBH be
extended for an additional period terminating on 21 June
1999. We agree with his observation that such a renewal
would be a demonstration by the international community
of its long-term commitment to the peace process in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. We shall therefore vote in
favour of the draft resolution before us.
