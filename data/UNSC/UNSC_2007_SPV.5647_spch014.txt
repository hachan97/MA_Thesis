Mr. Effah-Apenteng (Ghana): Ghana has joined
the consensus on Security Council resolution 1747
(2007) because we believe in the non-proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction. Although the resolution
that has just been adopted imposes sanctions on Iran,
we are heartened by the fact that it leaves the door
open to negotiations and that the stipulated measures
are reversible. We continue to believe and hope that
there will be a diplomatic solution to the protracted
negotiations on the Iranian nuclear programme.

Finally, my delegation wishes to use the occasion
to appeal to all States to live up to their international
obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons: non-proliferation, the right to the
peaceful use of nuclear energy and nuclear
disarmament. We recognize the sensitivity of the issue.
However, I hope the Council will pay attention to the
issue of selectivity - which has been raised by some
of our colleagues during the course of the debate - if
the international community is to succeed in checking
the spread of and eliminating weapons of mass
destruction.
