Mr. Ma Zhaoxu (China) (spoke in Chinese):
The Security Council has just unanimously adopted
resolution 2479 (2019), granting a four-month technical
rollover of the mandate of the African Union-United
Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) and
providing for an assessment of the situation in Darfur.
We welcome the resolution.

In recent years, the situation in Darfur has remained
stable, thanks to UNAMID's active and effective
mandate implementation and the good offices of the
African Union and other regional organizations. The
Government of the Sudan has made active efforts to
maintain peace and stability in Darfur and has played
a vital role. It is our belief that the Security Council
and the international community should continue to
fully respect the Government's leadership in the Darfur
issue, strengthen communication and coordination
with the Sudanese Government and listen attentively
to its views and suggestions so as to ensure the steady
implementation of UNAMID's transition plan and
the gradual transfer of security responsibilities to
Government security forces.

China has been a consistent supporter of the
peace process in Darfur. It is one of the major troop-
contributing countries to UNAMID. Over the years,
China has made robust efforts to keep Darfur peaceful
and stable and build UNAMID. Together with the rest
of the international community, China stands ready
to continue to play a constructive role in achieving
sustained peace, stability and development in Darfur.
