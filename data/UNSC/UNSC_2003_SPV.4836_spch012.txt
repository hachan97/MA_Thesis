Mr. De La Sabliere (France) (spoke in French):
Since this is the first time I am taking the floor this
month, like my colleagues who have spoken before me
I should like to wish you great success, Sir, in your
duties.
I also thank Ambassador Jones Parry for the way
in which he conducted our work last month.

We are deeply concerned by the deterioration of
the situation and the serious danger of rising tension.
We condemn violence from wherever it may come. It is
unacceptable and politically ineffective, kills innocent
people, obscures the political horizon and can only
aggravate the crisis.

The Israeli operation today that targeted a site
near Damascus is a grim business and an unacceptable
violation of international law and the rules of
sovereignty. In a Middle East situation that has already
been made precarious by such crises, it is the
responsibility of all, particularly of States in the region,
to refrain from increasing stability and tension. Any act
of terrorism is unjustifiable and should be condemned.
Having said that, the fight against terrorism to which
France is firmly committed must be undertaken in the
context of respect for international law. That is
essential.

I stress once again that the situation in the Middle
East is most alarming. In such difficult circumstances,
we appeal to all parties - particularly the Israelis,
Palestinians and Syrians - to allow reason to prevail
over the threat of escalation. There can be no lasting
security without peace. Peace can prevail only through
negotiation, not by the force of arms. It is essential that
the opportunity for a comprehensive, just and lasting
settlement be sought in accordance with the relevant
Security Council resolutions. The road map, which
contains Syrian and Lebanese tracks, must be given a
chance.
