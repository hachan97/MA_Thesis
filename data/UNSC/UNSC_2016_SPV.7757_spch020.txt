Mr. Lamek (France) (spoke in French): I will
not revisit the grotesque and insulting musings of the
Permanent Representative of Syria. I simply wanted
to share - not my surprise, because, really, I was not
expecting miracles from him - that I would have liked
to hear the Permanent Representative of Syria speak
about today's topic, namely, the humanitarian situation
in Syria, the need for the 48-hour humanitarian pauses
and the need to return to the cessation of hostilities.
I would have liked to hear him speak about the real
issues - the issues that affect Syrians today and that
brought us together - not to hear his absurd ranting, on
which I think we need not waste time.
