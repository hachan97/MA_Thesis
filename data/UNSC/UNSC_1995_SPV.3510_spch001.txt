The President (interpretation from Chinese): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them document
S/1995/209, which contains a note dated 20 March 1995 by
the Secretary-General concerning the date of an election to
fill a vacancy in the International Court of Justice. The note
explains the need for the item on our agenda.

The resignation of Sir Robert Jennings, which will
take effect on 10 July 1995, will create a vacancy in the
International Court of Justice that will have to be filled. Sir
Robert Jennings was President of the Court from 1991 to
1994 and sat as a member during two Chamber cases: the
Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute between El
Salvador and Honduras, Nicaragua intervening, from 1986
to 1992; and Elettronica Sicula S.p.A, from 1987 to 1989.
He has been a member of the Permanent Court of
Arbitration since 1982 and a sometime legal consultant to
a number of Governments. Sir Robert Jennings is the author
of various books and former editor of several law journals,
including the International and Comparative Law
Quarterly - from 1957 to 1959 - and the British
Yearbook of International Law, in 1959.

Sir Robert Jennings was elected a member of the
International Court of Justice on 6 February 1982. He was
re-elected, as from 6 February 1991, for a further period
of nine years. His current term of office would have
expired on 5 February 2000.

Under Article 14 of the Statute of the International
Court of Justice, the Security Council shall fix the date
for the election to fill the vacancy in the Court. As agreed
during our prior consultations on this matter, the election
is to take place on 12 July 1995 at a meeting of the
Security Council and at a meeting of the General
Assembly at its forty-ninth session.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/ 1995/213, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations.

May I take it that the Council is ready to proceed to
a decision on the draft resolution?

There being no objection, it is so decided.

In the light of consultations which I have held, it is
my understanding that the Security Council is ready to
adopt the draft resolution contained in document
S/ 1995/213 without a vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The draft resolution has been adopted as resolution
980 (1995).

The Security Council has thus concluded its
consideration of the item on the agenda.

The meeting rose at 12.25 pm.
