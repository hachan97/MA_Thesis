Mr. Duval (Canada) (spoke in French): Canada voted
in favour of the resolution the Council has just adopted. We
would have preferred to adopt a 180-day roll-over into
phase VII. However, we are able to support this seven-day
extension in order to allow an extra week for negotiations
among the permanent members on a comprehensive
resolution.

( spoke in English)

These temporary, technical roll-overs cannot
continue indefinitely. Should one week prove insufficient,
we hope that serious consideration will be given by all
members to a 180-day roll-over the next time.

We urge the permanent members to use this extra
week to achieve progress that will allow the
comprehensive resolution to finally be brought back to the
Security Council for consideration and action.
