The President: I wish to remind all speakers to
limit their statements to no more than four minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements
are kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing
and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in
the Chamber. 1 would also like to appeal to speakers
to deliver their statements at a normal speed so that
interpretation may be provided properly. I also wish to
inform all concerned that we will be carrying on this
open debate right through the lunch hour, as we have a
very large number of speakers.

I now give the floor to the Minister for Foreign
Affairs and International Cooperation of Italy.
