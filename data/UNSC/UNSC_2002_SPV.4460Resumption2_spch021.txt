The President: I thank the Secretary-General of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU), Mr. Amara
Essy, for his remarks. I hope that in the future it will be
possible to have an imaginative format for
collaboration between the OAU and the United
Nations.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council will remain seized of the matter.

Before I adjourn the meeting, I would like to
make two remarks. First, I would like to request
Mr. Ibrahim Fall to circulate the summary he has given,
on a without-prejudice basis, to all the members who
have participated in the debate.

Before I adjourn the meeting, I think it is my duty
to express my sincere thanks to all the Ministers and to
Mr. Amara Essy, who have travelled all the way to
New York to participate in this debate. I think the
debate has been enriching, and that we are all going to
leave New York with a better sense of what Africa
needs and how we are going to solve the problems of
Africa. I would also like to thank all the other
Ambassadors and Permanent Representatives who have
participated in the debate. I would like to thank them
specially for the quality of their statements. There is no
other business.

The meeting rose at 6.35 pm.
