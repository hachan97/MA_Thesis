France welcomes the commitment of the Russian Federation to the women and peace and security agenda, as reflected in its organization of the open debate on 29 October (S/2020/1084) and the announcement of its participation in the Informal Expert Group on Women, Peace and Security, created in 2015. As a long-standing supporter of the women and peace and security agenda anda partner of Russia, France engaged transparently and constructively in the negotiation process on draft resolution S/2020/1054, marking the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000). However, the draft resolution put to the vote by Russia does not match the challenges and ambition that are required. In particular, we regret that the requests expressed by the overwhelming majority of delegations to reaffirm what is essential, such as the indispensable role of civil society, were dismissed. The eagerness to adopt the draft resolution before the end of this month did not allow us to unite around a consensual text. However, the debate in the Security Council (S/2020/1084) unambiguously confirmed that we have a robust normative framework and that the time has come to implement every one of our resolutions. For all those reasons, France decided to abstain in the voting on this draft resolution.
