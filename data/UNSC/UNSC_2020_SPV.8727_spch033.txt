Mr. Sinirlioglu (Turkey): Yes, Mr. President, but I did not start this exchange, so I will end when they end.I will just say that I still regret that the previous speaker can exploit his presence in the Chamber by taking the floor and repeating all the delusions he has been repeating for the past nine years in the Security Council. I will not respond to him.
