Mr. Baja (Philippines): We abstained in the vote
on resolution 1559 (2004) because it cannot be justified
as part of the role given to the Security Council in the
collective security system under the United Nations
Charter. There is a fine but nevertheless clear boundary
that demarcates the role of the Council in the
maintenance of international peace and security as
embodied in Article 39. Resolution 1559 (2004)
crossed that line, and it collides head-on with the long-
standing and revered principle of non-interference
embodied in the Charter.

We acknowledge the generally constructive
rationale of the resolution - to promote and enhance
the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon. But
no matter how noble and well-intentioned its motives
are, resolution 1559 (2004) places the Council in a
situation of acting in a manner that it seeks to excise in
the first place, and that is not to interfere in what is
essentially internal affairs of a country. Article 2,
paragraph 7, of the Charter is sacrosanct. The
amendments presented by the Russian Federation
would have removed the resolution from a distinctly
Lebanese internal affairs context.

Our action today is aimed at preserving the
integrity of the United Nations Charter and its time-
honoured values of sovereign equality of States and
non-interference. As a founding Member, we feel a
special duty to the Organization to show resolve in
defence of its Charter and principles.
