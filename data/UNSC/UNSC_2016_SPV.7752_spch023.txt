Ms. Power (United States of America): I do not
wish to try people's patience on a Friday evening,
so I shall be brief. The point I wished to make in my
explanation of vote was that when the African Union
(AU) came together, as it did usefully to propose the
deployment of 200 monitors a year and two months
prior to the negotiation of a resolution by the Security
Council, and when only 36 of those 200 monitors have
been deployed and none has been able to exercise the
mandate that was given to them by the African Union,
that is worthy of comment here at the United Nations
as we seek to support our African brothers and sisters.
A reference to the AU, without making note of what
that AU mission has become, would have seemed to be
divorced from reality.
