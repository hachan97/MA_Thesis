Ms. Haley (United States ofAmerica): I should like
to express the deepest condolences of the United States
on the passing of Ambassador Vitaly Churkin. I did not
have the honour of working with Vitaly for very long,
but his diplomacy will be long remembered. He was a
fierce advocate for his country. He was a consummate
diplomat. He was brilliant, wise, gracious and funny.
He could spot even the narrowest opportunities to find
a compromise. Having spent the early part of his career
in the United States, Vitaly also recognized the value of
closer ties between our two countries.

Vitaly's passing is a shock to all of us and a great
loss. Let me once again, on behalf of the United States,
offer our thoughts and prayers to Vitaly's family, to our
colleagues at the Russian Mission and to the people of
Russia. God bless.
