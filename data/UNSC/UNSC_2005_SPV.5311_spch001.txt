The President (spoke in Russian): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Burundi, in which she requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

On behalf of the Council, I extend a warm
welcome to Her Excellency Mrs. Antoinette
Batumubwira, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Burundi.

At the invitation of the President,
Mrs. Batumubwira (Burundi) took a seat at the
Council table.

The President (spoke in Russian): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
fifth report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Operation in Burundi, document S/2005/728.
Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2005/74l, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations.

I wish to draw the attention of members to
document S/2005/736, containing the text of a letter
dated 23 November 2005 from the Charge d'affaires ad
interim of the Permanent Mission of Burundi addressed
to the President of the Security Council.

I now invite Her Excellency Mrs. Batumubwira,
Foreign Minister of Burundi, to make a statement.
