Mr. Orrenius Skau (Sweden): Sweden has
been clear in condemning in the strongest terms the
attempted murder of individuals on United Kingdom
soil using a nerve agent. We stand fully behind the
common European Union (EU) position on that matter.
We share the assessment of the United Kingdom that
it is highly likely that Russia is responsible and that
there is no other plausible alternative explanation. We
reiterate our strong solidarity with the United Kingdom,
our close friend and EU partner, and our support for its
ongoing investigation.

With regard to the chemical weapons use, as we
have heard today, the United Kingdom is conducting its
own independent police investigation. It is cooperating
with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons (OPCW). That is in full conformity with the
Chemical Weapons Convention. The United Kingdom
has acted in the correct manner under the Convention.
We underline the importance of respect for that process,
in which the United Kingdom is cooperating with the
OPCW, the independent international organization
charged with overseeing the chemical-weapons ban.
We look forward to being kept informed about the
investigation, including the upcoming report regarding
the sample analysis by the OPCW. We call on Russia
to answer the questions posed by the United Kingdom.
Finally, let me once again underline Sweden's
principled position on chemical weapons. Those
abhorrent weapons are clearly prohibited under
international law. All use of chemical weapons must
be properly investigated and accountability must
be ensured. We need to be vigilant in our efforts to
ensure that the integrity of the chemical weapons ban
is respected.
