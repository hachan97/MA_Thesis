Mr. Djani (Indonesia): Indonesia welcomes the adoption of resolution 2542 (2020). We would also like to thank the penholder and members of the Security Council for their engagement. Since the current conflict in Libya started in April 2019, the Council has stated again and again that there is no military solution for Libya. To that end, the role of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) is indeed crucial. The resolution we adopted today means the following: no more fighting, no more foreign interference. Indonesia voted in favour of the resolution in support of the work of UNSMIL and its leadership in brokering peace in Libya. The resolution provides space and flexibility for the Mission to facilitate a long-standing ceasefire as well as to protect the people in Libya, including its efforts to fight coronavirus disease. We call for a strong UNSMIL after its being weakened for more than six months. As Libyans face a new chapter ahead at this time, it is timely for new leadership at UNSMIL to be appointed. Indonesia also acknowledges the international efforts that have been made for Libya, including the Berlin process and the facilitation of the intra-Libyan dialogue by the Kingdom of Morocco, and we also recognize Tunisia for supporting and hosting UNSMIL. In a renewed partnership, we now have the opportunity to save lives in Libya. Let us continue the momentum and move forward to attain a lasting peace.
