The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

Since today is 31 July and this is the last meeting
of the Council that I will preside over on behalf of
Colombia, I would like to warmly thank the members
of the Council for their support and cooperation this
month. It has been a particularly busy month for the
Security Council, with some 38 formal and informal
meetings held on very important subjects. I would also
like to thank the Secretariat for its service and support,
as well as our interpreters and Verbatim Reporters.

The meeting rose at 10.35 am.
