The President: I thank Mr. Mladenov for
his briefing.

Before giving the floor to Council members, I
should like to highlight the presence in the Chamber
of the new Permanent Representative of the United
Kingdom to the United Nations, Ambassador Karen
Pierce, and, on behalf of all members of the Council, to
extend a warm welcome to her.

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements.
