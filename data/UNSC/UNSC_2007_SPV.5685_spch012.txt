Mr. Matulay (Slovakia): We welcome the
adoption of resolution 1757 (2007). We have supported
this resolution because we believe that impunity should
not be allowed and tolerated. The perpetrators of any
crime have to be brought to justice. The rule of law
must be respected everywhere and by everybody. The
establishment of the Tribunal is necessary for a
thorough investigation of the cases of politically
motivated violence - in fact, terrorism - and for
bringing perpetrators of these outrageous crimes to
justice.

As all available means have unfortunately been
exhausted on an issue that could not be solved through
Lebanese constitutional means, the Security Council
had to resume its responsibility and ensure the
implementation of the agreement between the United
Nations and the Lebanese Republic through a legally
binding resolution.

We believe that the resolution of this issue will
contribute to the stabilization of the situation in
Lebanon and to the process of national reconciliation.
