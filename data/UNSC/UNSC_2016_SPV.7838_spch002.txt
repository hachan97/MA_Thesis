Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian delegation was surprised by
this resolution, submitted by the United States, which
extends the mandate of the United Nations Mission
in the Republic of South Sudan for just one day. That
is all the more surprising given that the sponsors had
sufficient time to come to agreement on the resolution.
Not a single round of consultations was held, and the
concerns of other delegations had been set out fairly
clearly and repeatedly. Once again, this leads us to the
conclusion concerning the detrimental effect of the
current penholder system, when three Security Council
delegations took over the process of preparing Council
decisions. We hope that Council members will take
on board our initiative on reviewing the penholder
arrangement.

The meeting rose at 6.10p.m.
