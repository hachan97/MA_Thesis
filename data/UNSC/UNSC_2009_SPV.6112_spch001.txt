The President (spoke in Spanish): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Rodolphe Adada,
Joint African Union-United Nations Special
Representative for Darfur and head of the African
Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Adada to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the deployment of
the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in
Darfur, which is contained in document 8/2009/201.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Rodolphe Adada, on whom I now call.
