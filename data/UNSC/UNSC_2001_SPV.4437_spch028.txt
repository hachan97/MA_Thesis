The President (spoke in French): I thank the
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Zimbabwe for his kind
words addressed to me.

Since there are a number of speakers still on the
list who have not yet spoken and due to the lateness of
the hour, I intend, with the concurrence of the members
of the Council, to suspend this meeting until 6 pm. I
would draw the members' attention to our

consultations this afternoon. Since this meeting is
suspending late, we shall hold our consultations at
3.15 pm. sharp.

The meeting was suspended at 2.30 pm.
