The President (spoke in French): I would like to
make it clear, in fact, that due to circumstances above
and beyond the will of the Council, have not permitted
it to welcome all of the communities. I understand that
it is the intention of our Special Representative to
allow all of the communities, if they so wish, to be
present at the time of our next meeting in this
Chamber.
