President Kabila: I should like first of all to
thank all those who have expressed their condolences
to me in person and, of course, to the people of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo. I should also like
to thank all those who have encouraged the Democratic
Republic of the Congo to stay on track and to move on
in the way that it has chosen - the way towards peace.

At the same time, I would like to remind the
Security Council that its unwavering support is needed
to accomplish this particular task in the Democratic
Republic ofthe Congo. I would also like to reaffirm the
commitment of the Government of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and of myself as the President
ofthe Democratic Republic ofthe Congo to seeing to it
that we reach those objectives that we have set - the
final objective being the democratization of the
political life ofthe Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Nevertheless, it would be inappropriate ifI do not
add that this chain of events will come about only if the
forces that invaded the Democratic Republic of the
Congo are one way or the other forced to get out of it
so that it regains its national territorial integrity. All the
good words that have been expressed will not erase the
fact that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is
under foreign occupation - an unjust occupation in
relation to all international laws - and that this
occupation must end as soon as possible.
