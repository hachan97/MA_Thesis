Mr. Terence (Burundi): The adoption of this
resolution leads me to express, on behalf of my
Government, our sincere thanks to all the members of the
Security Council for this important development in the
process of the search for peace in my country.

Some operative paragraphs deserve more praise than
others. One of them, operative paragraph 6, deals with the
decision of the Council to establish a United Nations radio
station. This initiative would have an extraordinarily
beneficial impact on public opinion and on Burundi society.
We think that this kind of innovation deserves gratitude
from my country, and, of course, we hope that the
implementation of this paragraph will not remain a dead
letter. On all grounds, we think that a resolution of this
type is far more realistic than other options, which might
jeopardize all the efforts made in this process towards
peace.

In conclusion, Sir, upon your assumption of the
presidency I congratulated you and also stated how
beneficial and important the task you are discharging is.
However, I was expecting to have this opportunity to
speak of Botswana - of the central role your delegation
has been playing for the last six months and of the close
ties my delegation and yours have established since my
arrival six months ago. Therefore, it is needless to
emphasize how thankful we are for the central role your
delegation has been playing and for the commendable
dedication of Your Excellency to the cause of my
country, of Africa in general and of the United Nations as
well.

We think, Sir, that if you carry on with this
momentum, our people, our Government and the other
main actors in my country might be in a position to
finally reach the ultimate goal - not only the dialogue
that we have been proposing and on which we have been
insisting, but specifically, and most importantly, the
ultimate goal, which is national reconciliation.
