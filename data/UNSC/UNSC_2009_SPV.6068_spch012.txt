Mr. Duale (Somalia): Let me first and foremost
congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of
the presidency and to congratulate you on resolution
1863 (2009), which has been adopted unanimously
under your presidency. I also express our gratitude to
all the members of the Security Council for having
voted unanimously in favour of the resolution.

We believe that the resolution is a step in the
right direction for the time being in trying to address
the complex situation in Somalia, bearing in mind that
that complex situation requires measures that are not
only active but also urgent. A comprehensive holistic
approach is required to address the root causes of the
crisis in Somalia, which has been ongoing for almost
20 years and now includes acts of piracy off the Somali
coast, on which the Security Council has already taken
necessary action, again in unanimity.

I am also grateful for the very wise statements
made by the members of the Council, starting with my
colleague from the Untied States. I should like to
congratulate him and to express my regret that he is
leaving us.

I should also like to thank all the others who have
mentioned on a positive note that it is essential that a
United Nations peacekeeping force deploy as soon as
possible - time and other factors allowing. However, I
think that, as my colleagues from Uganda and Turkey
have mentioned, if we establish the sine qua non
condition that there must be peace and stability before
a United Nations operation can start, that may take
more than another 10 years.

Somalis are trying to implement the Djibouti
agreement. As usual, there are always problems when
such a complex agreement has to be implemented. If
we wait until everything is in place, I believe that we
will miss the boat and Somalia will be forever absent
from the international community.

I would very much like to thank the Council for
this resolution, which we believe is a good one that
gives us hope for the future.
