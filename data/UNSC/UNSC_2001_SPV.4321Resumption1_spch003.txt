The President: I meant to note at the outset of
the discussion this afternoon for the information of
Council members that Mr. Gusmao has an appointment
with the Secretary-General at 4 pm. and will be
leaving shortly before then, but Mr. Ramos-Horta will
be remaining with us for the remainder of the meeting.

The next speaker is the representative of Canada.
I invite him to take a seat at the Council and to make
his statement.
