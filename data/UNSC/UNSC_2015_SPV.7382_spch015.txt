The President (spoke in Chinese): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of China.

The Council has just adopted unanimously
resolution 2201 (2015), on the question of Yemen,
which reiterates support for the sovereignty, unity and
territorial integrity of Yemen and explicitly requests
the parties concerned to engage in consultations in
dialogue for a peaceful settlement of their differences.
That is of importance in pushing the parties to achieve
reconciliation and restore stability at an early date.

China calls on the concerned parties in Yemen to
bear the fundamental interests of their nation and people
in mind, comprehensively implement all resolutions,
including resolution 2201 (2015), expedite their
dialogue and negotiations, and achieve reconciliation
as soon as possible. They should continue to implement
the outcome document of the National Dialogue
Conference, the Peace and National Partnership
Agreement, and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
Initiative. They should steadfastly advance the political
transition so that their country can embark on the path
to peace, stability and development at an early date.

China appreciates and supports the good offices
and mediation of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
and his Special Adviser on Yemen, Mr. Benomar. We
welcome the ongoing constructive role being played
by the GCC and the relevant international parties
concerned. China will continue to play an active role
in maintaining the peace and stability of Yemen and
advancing the political transition process.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

There are no more names inscribed on the list of
speakers. The Security Council has thus concluded
the present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 5.50 pm.
