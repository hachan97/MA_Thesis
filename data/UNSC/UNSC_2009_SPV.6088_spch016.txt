Mr. Dabbashi (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in Arabic): I should like to thank my friend, the
representative of France, for his second statement
emphasizing the need for cooperation between the
Council and regional organizations. However, I do not
wish to enter into a public debate on all the issues he
raised. Many of those issues made perfect sense to me,
but we differ on certain others concerning which I do
not want to enter into a public debate.

I wish merely to say that, in the future, when a
regional organization asks to brief the Security Council,
I hope that the Council will accept and respond to that
request, whether it has been made in respect of a broad
range of issues or to a specific case of such importance
to that regional organization that the Council is called
on to consider it carefully and act on it. That is all I
wished to stress, and I hope that there will be consensus
in the future among all members of the Council.

Not all members of the Council have been
opposed to such briefings in the past. Only some have
objected, and we hope that in the future no member
will raise such an objection.
