The President: There are no more speakers on

my list.
I thank my colleagues for their contributions,
especially Assistant Secretary-General Annabi - not

just for his contribution, but also for what it represents
in terms of the work that the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo does.

We have all shown today, I think, our clear
support for the Special Representative. Resolution
1244 (1999) remains the basis of policy and there has
been a clear emphasis on standards before status. As
for dialogue, most speakers have endorsed what is
taking place and expressed the imperative of tackling
the security situation and of stabilizing things. The
recent attacks have been condemned by just about
everybody.

We have thus concluded the Security Council's
consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 1.10pm.
