Mr. Sharma (India): Any damage to a diplomatic
establishment, intended or otherwise, is to be entirely
deplored. This incident, along with continuing loss of
innocent civilian lives and other untoward consequences,
including ecological damage and large-scale displacement
of people, only confirms that the very fundamentals of the
new approach of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) are wrong.

The incident also starkly underlines what we in India,
along with a good part of the international community, have
been emphasizing from the very beginning: that a solution
to the problems relating to the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia is to be found only in means other than the
military. Continuous aerial bombardment in the name of
humanitarian issues, resulting in the loss of innocent
civilian lives and other tragic occurrences, is totally
unacceptable. There is no alternative to the path of dialogue
and a negotiated settlement.

We also remain seriously concerned about the overall
human tragedy that we continue to witness in the region.
The world cannot ignore the increased resultant tension in
the region and the potential for greater consequential
instability. We would therefore urge an immediate end to
all hostilities so as to give peace a chance.

We express our sympathy and condolence to the
Chinese Government and to the families of the victims.
