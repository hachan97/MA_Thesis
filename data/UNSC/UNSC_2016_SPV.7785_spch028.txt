Mr. Van Bohemen (New Zealand): I am used to the
fantastical reveries of the Syrian representative. Very
little of what he says can be relied upon as accurate.
But when he tells blatant lies about the delivery of
humanitarian aid to the Syrian people, I must speak
up. The record is clear. The delays in the delivery of
humanitarian aid, the removal of medical equipment
and the other obstructions that are put in the way of
United Nations convoys - all the responsibility lies
very much with the Syrian regime.
