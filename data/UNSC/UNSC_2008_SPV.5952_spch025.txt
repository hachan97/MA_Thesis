Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Permanent Representative of Georgia
has said that he is surprised that in my statement I used
the words "ethnic cleansing". How else can we
describe it when during the course of today a town of
70,000 inhabitants is being destroyed? What else can
we call it when hospitals, schools and residential areas
are being destroyed, when scores of thousands of
refugees are leaving the Republic? How can you
describe these actions by a country that is trying to
operate by using the language of international law and
that is appealing to the international community to
protect its interests?

I believe that it would be very difficult to get to
the bottom of the details described by the
representative of Georgia and that it is quite difficult to
take anything that he has said on trust. What is the real
worth of the slander that the Georgian armed forces are
not targeting Russian peacekeepers, when we know
very well that quite the reverse is the case. When the
headquarters of the Russian peacekeepers was directly

targeted, people were killed, and people were wounded
in that attack. How can you unleash such slaughter,
such carnage, on a territory which is considered to be
the territory of Georgia, and then pretend to be
offended when you hear this perfectly clear term that
describes the actions by the Georgian side in this
situation?
