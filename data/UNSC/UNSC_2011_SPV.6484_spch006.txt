Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation voted in favour of
the draft resolution. Given our fundamental position,
we will not accept any unilateral actions that prejudge
the outcome of negotiations on final status issues. We
strongly urge the Government of Israel at last to
comply with the demands of the international
community and to stop settlement activity, which
violates the norms of international law and hinders the
resumption of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.
Unfortunately, no unanimity was achieved among
Security Council members today, and the draft
resolution was not adopted. However, the issue of
Israeli settlement activity remains on the agenda, and
the urgency of solving the issue will only increase.

As a permanent member of the Security Council
and a member of the Quartet of Middle East mediators,
Russia consistently continues to advocate a prompt
resumption of direct dialogue between the parties by
cooperating with regional and international partners in
seeking a just and comprehensive peace settlement in
the region, in accordance with Security Council
resolutions, the Madrid principles and the Arab Peace
Initiative.

We hope that by implementing the still relevant
Russian proposal to send the first-ever full Security
Council mission to the Middle East will be a useful
practical contribution towards assisting the peace
process.
