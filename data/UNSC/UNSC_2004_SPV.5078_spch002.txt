Mr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese):
We are deeply concerned at the current situation in
Cote d'Ivoire. We condemn the air raid conducted
against the French peacekeepers. We are also
concerned about the civilian casualties caused by this
conflict. We call upon the various parties to exercise
restraint so as to avoid further escalating the crisis.

China has always supported the peace process in
Cote d'Ivoire. We have always maintained that the
crisis in that country should be resolved by political
means. We hope that the situation in Cote d'Ivoire will
be stabilized as soon as possible so that the peace
process can be put back on the right track. We support
the mediation efforts of the African Union, the
Economic Community of West African States and the
Secretary-General. In particular, we appreciate the
efforts of President Mbeki of South Africa. We
sincerely hope that those mediation efforts will yield
positive results at an early date.

In the light of the current serious situation in C6te
d'Ivoire, China, like other members of the Security
Council, favours further Council action. At the same
time, we believe that the objective of such action
should be to encourage the various parties to comply
with the ceasefire and to resume the peace process. On
the basis of that principle, and taking into account the
views of the countries members of the African Union,
we voted in favour of the resolution.

The early achievement of peace and
reconciliation will advance the fundamental interests of
the people of Cote d'Ivoire and will help to stabilize
the region. We urge the various parties in Cote d'Ivoire
to cooperate with the mediation efforts of the
international community - particularly those of the
African Union - and to implement the Linas-
Marcoussis Agreement and the Accra III Agreement as
soon as possible. We hope that the resolution adopted
by the Security Council today will assist in the
attainment of those objectives.
