Mr. Garcia Moritan (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): Argentina voted in favour of the resolution
extending the mandate of the United Nations Mission
for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) for
a period of six months, because we understand that the
presence of the Mission in Western Sahara continues to
be necessary.

My delegation believes that the Security Council
must send a clear message to the parties that they must
endeavour to find a peaceful resolution to this long-
standing dispute. In that connection, we hope that the
next six months will be used positively to address the
stagnant situation we have seen in recent years. We are
convinced that, as in other disputes and conflicts on the
agenda of the United Nations, negotiations and
dialogue constitute the best way to find a definitive
solution in accordance with the Charter of the United
Nations and the relevant resolutions adopted by the
Security Council and other bodies of the Organization.

In that context, I would like to reiterate my
country's support for the work of Mr. Peter van
Walsum, Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General. We
thank him for his efforts in recent months and ask him
to continue to work to overcome the current impasse.

Lastly, I would like to stress that the report of the
Secretary-General (S/2006/249) expresses concern at
the worsening of the human rights situation in the
territory. We hope that the mission by the Office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights
will be able to undertake its visit in mid-May in order
to investigate the situation and prepare a report.

Given the importance that Argentina attaches to
the protection of human rights, we will continue to
follow closely the developments in this area. My
delegation hopes that these matters will be taken into
consideration by the Council when it takes up the next
renewal of MINURSO's mandate, in October 2006.
