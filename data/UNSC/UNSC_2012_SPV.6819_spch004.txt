Mr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (Spoke in Spanish):
Guatemala joined the consensus and voted in favour of
resolution 2063 (2012), which extends the mandate of
the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation
in Darfur (UNAMID) until 31 July 2013. We hope that
the adoption of the resolution will allow UNAMID
to continue to exercise the mandate granted by the
Council, particularly in protecting civilians and
assisting the efforts to arrive at a prompt peace and
stability in the region, based on the implementation of
the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur.

However, we note in our national capacity that,
while having voted in favour of the resolution, we have
serious reservations regarding paragraph 17, which
refers to the Lord's Resistance Army. Although we
recognize that there may be indications of attacks by
guerilla or armed groups in the Sudan, the decisions of
the Council should be taken on the basis of evidence,
facts or concrete information of the events on the
ground. In the current case, the objective information
from the Secretariat does not provide a basis for
believing that there is any involvement of the Lord's
Resistance Army in the zone covered by UNAMID.
