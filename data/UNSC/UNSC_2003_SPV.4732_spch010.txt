The President (spoke in French): There are no
further speakers inscribed on my list.

I would like, as the representative of Guinea,
holding the presidency of this Council for the month of
March, to express how gratified my delegation is at the
unanimous adoption of this resolution on the
emergency humanitarian situation in Iraq.

If this resolution had not been adopted, my
delegation would be even sadder after all of our
collective efforts during the month of March. The
adoption of this resolution was indispensable to
restoring the credibility of this body. In this regard, I
thank the Secretary-General personally for his efforts
to bring about this result, as well as the representative
of Germany, our colleague Ambassador Pleuger, who
did everything in his power during the entire week to
establish unanimous support in the Council for this
resolution. I thank him.

I now give the floor to the Secretary-General.
