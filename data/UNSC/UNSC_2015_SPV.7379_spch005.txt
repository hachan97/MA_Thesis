Mr. Delattre (France) (spoke in French): France
was severely struck by terrorist attacks in January. Far
from laying us low, the attacks have strengthened our
resolve to fight terrorism in all its forms, and to develop
the international means and instruments available to
do so. Yesterday, the presence of French Minister of
Justice Christiane Taubira and her presentation to the
Counter-Terrorism Committee clearly illustrated our
determination. Our co-sponsorship of resolution 2199
(2015) is yet another demonstration thereof.

Following upon resolution 2170 (2014), the text
we have just adopted strengthens the obligations
incumbent upon States, including in the following
fields. It condemns all trade, direct and indirect, in
particular of oil and associated materials, with the
targeted terrorist individuals and entities, under pain
of sanctions. States will have to inform the competent
United Nations committee of any transfer on their
territory of oil or associated materials to or from those
groups. The resolution condemns the destruction of
cultural heritage, including religious heritage, in Syria
and Iraq. States will have to take measures to prevent
the illegal trafficking of cultural goods, including
archeological artifacts. It condemns the kidnapping and
exploitation, including sexual exploitation, of women
and children.

For all these reasons, France will remain mobilized
in the fight against terrorism at all levels, be it military,
a political solution to the conflict, or financial.
