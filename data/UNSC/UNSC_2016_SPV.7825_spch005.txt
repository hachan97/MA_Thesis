Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): This is not the first time we have seen this.
Secretary of State John Kerry has been working with
our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, to
reach a concrete result. But whenever they near an
agreement, somebody undermines it. Sometimes
that effort originates in Washington, DC, from the
Department of Defense or from some other American
agency. Now, unfortunately, this tactic has been
employed by the delegation of the United States in New
York. It is most unfortunate that serious agreements
are reached, and then we are told that nothing of the
kind exists. There was a meeting and an agreement
on new elements submitted by John Kerry, not the
Russian side. Subsequently, we were told that the
American representatives needed three additional days
to discuss the issue, following which we were told that
no agreement had been reached. I recall that, had the
agreement of 12 September been implemented, it would
have allowed us to address the problem in eastern
Aleppo. Once again we are faced with same situation
today, and we strongly deplore it.

The United States must shoulder its responsibility,
which it is trying impose on others, especially in
connection with resolving the problem in Syria. As
co-Chair of the International Syria Support Group,
the United States should show coherence in its
actions, but that is not the case. We are witnessing
the dramatic consequences of that lack of coherence
today. Unfortunately, the United States delegation,
as the members of the Security Council know, has
shamelessly put pressure on the three co-sponsors of
the draft resolution (S/2016/1026) to put it to the vote,
knowing that it would not be adopted. That undermines
the unity of the Council. There is no longer any unity
between the two co-Chairs of the International Syria
Support Group. That represents a dangerous strategy.
