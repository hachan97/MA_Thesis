Mr. Kumalo (South Africa): South Africa has
followed developments in Georgia over the past few
months with concern, especially because of their
implications for the stability of the Caucasus region as
a whole and their impact on bilateral relations between
Georgia and its neighbours, in particular the Russian
Federation. On numerous occasions, my delegation has
stressed the need for the resolution of conflicts and
disputes through consultation and negotiation, based on
the principles of the United Nations Charter and
Security Council resolutions. That approach is
important in securing a lasting and sustainable
solution. Resort to the use of force diminishes the
chances of a lasting solution and increases the
suffering of those affected.

We are indeed disappointed that the Security
Council has not been able to agree to endorse the
ceasefire agreement negotiated by President Sarkozy of
France and President Medvedev of the Russian
Federation, and signed by Georgia, South Ossetia and
Abkhazia. In our view, that agreement presented a
good basis for further consultation. The failure to
endorse that agreement, after it was signed and
accepted by all the parties, has complicated all efforts
to find a lasting solution.

We would have also preferred the Council to
engage, in any format, with both South Ossetia and
Abkhazia in order to allow all parties to the conflict
access to the Council, so as to enable it to take
decisions based on that engagement. My delegation
will continue to follow developments and to contribute
to the resolution of the problem by actively
participating in the work of the Security Council in this
regard. We stand ready to work with all concerned in
order to achieve a lasting political solution.
