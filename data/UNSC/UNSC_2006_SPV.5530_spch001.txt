The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Bahrain, Finland and Israel in which
they request to be invited to participate in the
consideration of the item on the Council's agenda. In
accordance with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the consideration of the item, without
the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I should like to inform the Council that I have
received a letter dated 21 September 2006 from the
Permanent Observer of Palestine to the United Nations,
which will be issued as document S/2006/752 and
which reads as follows.

"I have the honour to request that, in
accordance with its previous practice, the
Security Council invite the Permanent Observer
of Palestine to the United Nations to participate
in the meeting of the Security Council being held
on Thursday, 21 September 2006, regarding the
situation in the Middle East, including the
Palestinian question."

I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, Executive Chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organization and President of the
Palestinian Authority, to participate in the meeting in
accordance with the Council's provisional rules of
procedure and previous practice in this regard.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. Members of
2

the Council have before them document S/2006/700,
which contains a letter dated 30 August 2006 from the
Permanent Observer of the League of Arab States to
the United Nations addressed to the President of the
Security Council.

I invite the Secretary-General, His Excellency
Mr. Kofi Annan, to take the floor.
