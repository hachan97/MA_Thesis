The President: Can the representative of Syria
here today guarantee and state that his Government
will support and follow the rule of international
humanitarian law requiring it to promote the safe,
voluntary, dignified and well-informed return of
refugees to their homes?

I resume my functions as President of the Security
Council.

I give the floor to the representative of the Syrian
Arab Republic.
