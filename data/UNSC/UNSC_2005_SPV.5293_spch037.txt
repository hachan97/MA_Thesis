The President: I thank the representative of
Colombia for her kind words to the Chair.

I should like to inform the Council that I have
just received letters from the representatives of
Pakistan and the Syrian Arab Republic, in which they
request to be invited to participate in the discussion of
the item on the Council's agenda. In accordance with
the usual practice I propose, with the consent of the
Council, to invite those representatives to participate in
the discussion without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objective, it is so decided.
I now give the floor to the representative of
Pakistan.
