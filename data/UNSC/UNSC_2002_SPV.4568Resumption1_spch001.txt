The President: I should like to inform the
Council that the representative of Yugoslavia has
requested to be invited to participate in the discussion
of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with
the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the
Council, to invite that representative to participate in
the discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Sahovie
(Yugoslavia) took the seat reservedfor him at the
side ofthe Council Chamber.

The President: The next speaker inscribed on my
list is the representative of Fiji. I invite him to take a
seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
