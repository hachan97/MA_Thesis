Mr. Nduhungirehe (Rwanda): I would like to thank
you, Madam President, for convening this emergency
meeting on Ukraine, and Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, Under-
Secretary-General for Political Affairs, for his briefing
on the developments in the situation in eastern Ukraine.
We believe, however, that the Ukrainian people and
the international community will not judge us on the
number of public briefings we organize in the Council
or the toughness of our statements, but on our political
will and how we use our influence to effectively help
Ukrainians resolve the crisis in their country.

We are witnessing a situation that is deteriorating
every day and leading slowly to an open war that might
involve countries of the region and beyond. Indeed, the
developments of the last few weeks are alarming and
have immensely undermined the diplomatic efforts to
defuse the situation. We condemn in the strongest terms

the attempt made to assassinate Hennadiy Kernes, the
Mayor of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, as
well as the illegal detention of the military monitors
from the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe (OSCE) and their Ukrainian staff, which is
a serious violation of the current agreement, and we
demand their immediate release.

While we welcome the joint de-escalation measures
agreed on in Geneva on 17 April and involving the main
stakeholders as a step towards a tangible solution to the
crisis, we are concerned about the fact that many of
those measures have not been implemented. We urge all
parties to implement their parts of the agreement, and
especially to disarm all military groups and restore all
seized buildings. The OSCE monitors must be allowed
to play a role and to fulfil their mandate, as stipulated
in the joint declaration.

In the meantime, Rwanda reiterates its call for
respect for Ukraine's independence, sovereignty
and territorial integrity. We believe in the right to
peaceful demonstration, but we firmly condemn the
use of violence, the seizure of public buildings and the
installation of illegal checkpoints by armed protesters.
We therefore believe that Ukraine, like any other
country, has a right to restore public order, provided
that right is exercised in a proportionate manner.
Nonetheless, the crisis in eastern Ukraine is not merely
a matter of public order but a political issue that must be
resolved through genuine dialogue with all Ukrainian
parties, with a view to ensuring sustainable peace and
equal rights for all, including the Russian-speaking
minority.

To conclude, we reiterate our strong belief that
while public meetings of the Council are important for
its members to continue monitoring this crisis, the only
way to solve the crisis in Ukraine is through the exercise
of political will and the influence of all the countries
and regional organizations involved, in order to ensure
a political and diplomatic solution to the conflict.
