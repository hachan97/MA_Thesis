The President: I thank Mr. Feith for his
statement. He was correct in quoting from the
European Security Strategy, which is very relevant to
what we are discussing. None of the new threats is
purely military, nor can any be tackled by purely
military means. Addressing this is, in fact, what we are
trying to do now.
