Mr. de Mistura: If I may, I will take the liberty
to also respond on behalf of my friend, the Minister for
Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan, in saying that
everything we heard has helped us a lot. The Security
Council's support of and guidance to the Afghan
Government and the United Nations Assistance
Mission in Afghanistan are crucial. We need it and we
need to hear it, because the next months are going to be
even more challenging in view of the two areas on
which we will be focusing in particular.

I wish to thank the Council members on behalf, if
I may, of His Excellency the Minister for Foreign
Affairs and myself.
