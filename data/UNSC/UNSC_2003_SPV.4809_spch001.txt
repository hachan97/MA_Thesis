The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Serbia and Montenegro, in which
he requests to be invited to participate in the discussion
of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with
the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the
Council, to invite that representative to participate in
the discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

On behalf of the Council, I welcome Mr. Nebojsa
Covic, Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of
Serbia and President of the Coordination Centre for
Kosovo and Metohija.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Covic
(Serbia and Montenegro) took a seat at the
Council table.

The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in response
to the request contained in a letter dated 14 August
2003 from the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent
Mission of Serbia and Montenegro to the United
Nations, document 8/2003/815.

I now give the floor to Mr. Nebojsa Covic,
Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Serbia and
President of the Coordination Centre for Kosovo and
Metohija.
