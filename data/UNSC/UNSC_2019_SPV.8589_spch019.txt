Ms. Sirkin: Ijust wanted to correct a misquotation
I heard earlier from the representative of the Russian
Federation, who stated that two thirds of the reported
attacks that we cited from the last month have turned
out to be fake. That is absolutely not what I said, and,
in fact, we have so far confirmed 16 such attacks, and
we are still counting, which is due to the rigour of our
process and the fact that indeed we are not naive and
do not just take every report and print it out. We have
a very serious methodology, and there is absolutely no
way that we have cited fake reports. I just wanted to
correct that misquotation of my statement.
