The President: I shall now make a brief
statement in my capacity as representative of the
Philippines.

Yesterday, we were divided on Iraq. Today, we
are united on Iraq. It is a great day, therefore, for Iraq,
the Security Council, the United Nations and the
international community. The Philippines is
particularly pleased that this eloquent expression of
unity on Iraq has happened during our presidency. In
many significant ways, the resolution just adopted
validates the Philippine position of unwavering support
for a free, democratic, pluralistic and united Iraq.

We can congratulate ourselves on the house we
have built for Iraq. We built it with transparency and
inclusiveness, which led to the unanimous adoption of
the important resolution. The foundations of a lasting
edifice are in the resolution: the transfer of full
sovereignty come 30 June; the leading role of the
United Nations in assisting in the political process
towards a constitutional Government; and Iraq's
ownership of its security policies, financial and natural
resources and other attributes of sovereignty.

The challenge now for Iraq and the international
community is to translate into action what is laid down
in the resolution and to nurture its plan of action on the
ground. We are confident that, given the atmosphere of
accommodation and understanding in the Council and
the interest and concern which this resolution has
elicited from a great number of States, this challenge
can be met with success. We are happy to have been
part of the negotiation of the historic resolution 1546
(2004) and to have voted in its favour.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 6.10pm.
