The President (spoke in French): I thank
Ambassador De La Sabliere for his briefing.

On behalf of the Council, I should like to express
gratitude and appreciation to all the members of the
Security Council mission, which was so very ably led
by Ambassadors Kumalo, Jones Parry, Voto-Bernales
and De La Sabliere, for the manner in which they
discharged their important responsibilities on behalf of
the Council.
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The date of a meeting to discuss the written
report of the mission will be fixed in consultations
among the members of the Security Council.

The meeting rose at 1] 51.111.
