The President: I thank Mr. Guterres for his
briefing.

As there is no list of speakers, I invite Council
members who wish to make comments or address
questions to the High Commissioner to so indicate to
the Secretariat as from now.

I shall now give the floor to those who have
indicated their wish to speak.
