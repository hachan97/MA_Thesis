Mr. Hassan (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): I asked for
the floor once again just to give some clarifications
regarding the oil police around the Diffra oil complex.
I would like to reaffirm, as we have already stated, that
the oil police currently in Abyei is present pending the
establishment of a joint patrol police. Once the Abyei
Police Service has been established, we will withdraw
the police that are currently there. These forces are
stationed only around the oil complex.

With respect to the insecurity in Abyei, this is a
cause for concern to us too, as Ambassador Deng has
pointed out. We are working to create the necessary
mechanisms because security is a problem for the
other parties and for us alike. The Diffra oil complex
has suffered three sabotage attempts in recent months.
We have therefore had to maintain this unarmed police
force there so as to provide symbolic protection for the
oil complex. As soon as a police force to protect the oil
complex has been put in place, we will withdraw the
forces presently stationed in Abyei.
