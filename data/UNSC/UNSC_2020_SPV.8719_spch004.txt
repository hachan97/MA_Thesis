Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): Libya still faces multiple challenges, suchas the fragile security situation, rampant terrorist groups and outstanding refugee and migration issues. The international community should respect Libya's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and support the advancement of the United Nations-brokered Libyan- led and -owned political process. Given the current grave situation in Libya, the international community must continue its strict implementation of the arms embargo and refrain from military intervention or other actions that might aggravate the conflict. China therefore voted in favour of resolution 2509 (2020), just adopted. Nevertheless, it is China's consistent belief that sanctions are not an end but a means, and they should always serve the political settlement of relevant issues. When the Security Council takes action on the extension of the Libyan sanctions regime, it must base its decision on full consultations, and should send positive messages to the international community and interested countries that a given extension is conducive to a political settlement of the Libyan issue. The meeting rose at 3.20 p.m.
