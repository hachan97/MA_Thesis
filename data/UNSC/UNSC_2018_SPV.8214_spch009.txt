Mr. Miller (United States of America): I will also
deliver the bulk of my remarks in consultations, but I
want to take the floor here to make a couple of points
that it is important to raise in the open Chamber.

First, and above all, I want to extend warm welcome
to the new Permanent Representative of the United
Kingdom, Ambassador Pierce. We really look forward
to working with her.

Secondly, due to the attack in Saudi Arabia from
Yemen last night, I thought it was important to raise
that matter now as well. We strongly condemn the
Houthi missile attack that was aimed at several cities
in Saudi Arabia. This is the kind of action that is
deeply destabilizing for the region and one that we
have warned about previously. Our condolences go out
to the families of any who are killed or injured. We
also support the right of our Saudi partners to defend
their borders against these threats. We continue to
call on all parties, including the Houthis, to return to
political negotiations and move towards ending the war
in the Yemen.
