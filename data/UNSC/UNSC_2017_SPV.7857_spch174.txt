Mr. Arcia Vivas (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The Bolivarian Republic
of Venezuela is grateful to the Swedish presidency
for organizing this constructive debate and the
conclusions it has brought about for the strengthening
of international peace and security. Nonetheless, our
delegation regrets the fact that we have to take the floor
once again to underscore that, unfortunately, during this
debate on conflict prevention and sustainable peace, the
delegation of Morocco, in violation of the methodology
and practice of these debates, dedicated paragraphs of
its statement to slander our country and spread untruths
and misinformation by referring to the internal situation
in Venezuela and our principled position during our
membership in the Security Council.

Those unacceptable allusions are motivated by
the fact that our country has presented before the
Security Council the undeniable facts of a topic that
affects international peace and security and which is
on the Council's agenda and is the cause of resolutions
and debates in the General Assembly and in its
subsidiary committee - the Special Committee on
Decolonization - the question of the Western Sahara,
an issue has been awaiting for a political, definitive,
lasting and mutually acceptable solution for more than
20 years.

This unjustified attack is regrettable, but not
unusual, because it is part of the repeated strategy of
insults and attacks by the delegation of Morocco in any
authoritative United Nations body that tries to fulfil
the mandates of the Security Council and the General
Assembly with regard to the situation in Western
Sahara, which is the case with the work of the Special
Committee on Decolonization, the attacks on former
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the unilateral
expulsion of the civilian staff of the United Nations
Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara.

It is important to point out that Venezuela
presented in its statement today undeniable facts,
such as Morocco's occupation of Sahraoui territory
in Western Sahara, that country's ignoring of United
Nations resolutions and its failure to hold the self-
determination referendum, which should have taken
place 25 years ago. However, instead of making an
argument, the Moroccan delegation adopted a rude and
aggressive attitude, which is far removed from how
it should conduct itself in the diplomatic sphere and
which we condemn.

We regret these attitudes, which do not intimidate
us, nor do they undermine the Venezuela's position
that we should respect the principles that govern
the Organization, or our commitment to the cause
of decolonization.
