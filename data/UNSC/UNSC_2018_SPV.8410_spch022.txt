Mr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): I will be very brief,
because I think I was clear enough in my previous
statement, which needs no further explanation.

I just want to say that since the spring of 2014,
we have heard a lot of epic Russian stories saying that
"Crimea is ours" and "They are not there", meaning
Russians in Donbas. I think everyone, at least in this
Chamber, is completely fed up with all those stories.

My brief comment is specifically for the benefit of
Mr. Polyanskiy. The Kerch Strait can only be approached
from the south, because the Sea ofAzov is located north
of the Black Sea. When he said that the Ukrainian ships
were brazenly moving northward in trying to enter the
Kerch Strait, I could not understand what he meant.
They were attacked by the Russian Navy while moving
from the Kerch-Yenikale canal southward.
The meeting rose at 12.50p.m.
