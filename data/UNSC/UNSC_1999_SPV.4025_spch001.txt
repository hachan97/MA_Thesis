The President: On behalf of the Security Council, I
should like to express profound grief and sorrow at the
death of His Majesty King Hassan II of the Kingdom of
Morocco. King Hassan's entire life was dedicated to
devoted service to his country and to the cause of world
peace, stability and prosperity. His loss will be greatly felt.

On behalf of the Security Council, I should like to
convey to His Majesty King Sidi Mohamed VI, the
bereaved family and the people of the Kingdom of
Morocco the Council's profound condolences.

I now invite the members of the Council to rise and
observe a minute of silence in tribute to the memory of His
Majesty King Hassan II of the Kingdom of Morocco.

The members of the Security Council observed a
minute of silence.

reached in the Council's prior consultations, if I hear no
