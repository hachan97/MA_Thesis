The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank
Ambassador Ryan for his clarifications. I would like to
extend our thanks to him and to members of his team
for the efforts they have been making in this regard to
enhance the sanctions regime in Angola. As most
speakers said, those sanctions are not meant to punish;
but, rather, to force violators to respond to international
law and Security Council resolutions.

I would also like to thank again the Minister for
External Relations for coming to the meeting today to
listen to the consensus among the members of the
Council in support of peace efforts in Angola. I wish
the State and Government of Angola every success in
their efforts, particularly with regard to reconstruction
and development.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 8pm.
