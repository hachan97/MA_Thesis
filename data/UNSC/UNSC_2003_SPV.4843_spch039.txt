The President: Thank you, Ambassador, and
thank you again for joining us today. Clearly, you and
your colleagues have the support of the Council.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 1.50 pm.
