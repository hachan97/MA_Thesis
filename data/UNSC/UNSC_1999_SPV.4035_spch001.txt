The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of
Sierra Leone, in which he requests to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's
agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose,
with the consent of the Council, to invite that representative
to participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Dabor (Sierra Leone) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the seventh
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
Mission in Sierra Leone, documents S/l999/836 and
S/l999/836/Add.l.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/ 1999/874, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of members of the
Council to document S/ 1999/777, which contains the text of
a letter dated 12 July 1999 from the Charge d'affaires ad
interim of the Permanent Mission of Togo to the United
Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council,
transmitting the text of the Peace Agreement between the
Government of Sierra Leone and the Revolutionary United
Front (RUF) concluded at Lorne on 7 July 1999.

The first speaker is the representative of Sierra
Leone, to whom I give the floor.
