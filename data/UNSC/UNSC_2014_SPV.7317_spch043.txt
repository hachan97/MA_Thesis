Mr. Carrilho (spoke in French): As regards
language, of course since the United Nations police
(UNPOL) is the most visible face of the State, we want
the Central African police to be present everywhere,
and we are there to support them. All of UNPOL
staff now speak French in the Mission. This includes
individuals not only in UNPOL but also in the formed
police units. This is really the first mission in which I
have participated where we have had that capability. We
even have men and women police who are capable of
speaking Sangho because, as they were deployed with
the African-led International Support Mission in the
Central African Republic to the regional headquarters
of the African Union, it was very important to have that
contact.

But we need to be more specific in terms of
qualifications. Especially when we talk about
development, there are also capacities that may be
more important than language skills. For example, with
respect to the database in Haiti, it is more important
to have the relevant capacities and language skills
may be redundant. But as to the question asked by the
Permanent Representative of Chad, for which I thank
him, each and every officer in UNPOL speaks French
at this time.
