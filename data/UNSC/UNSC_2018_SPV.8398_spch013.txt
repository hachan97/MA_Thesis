Mr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish):
We also wish to express our appreciation for the
unanimous adoption of resolution 2444 (2018) lifting
the sanctions against Eritrea, which bears witness to
the positive progress being made towards establishing
a dialogue between Eritrea and its neighbours and
the general easing of tensions in the Horn of Africa
region as a whole. However, we wish to underline that
it is important to resolve such pending issues as those
concerning the disappeared soldiers and the border
between Djibouti and Eritrea. The role of Ethiopia in
all of the positive developments in the region must be
highlighted and acknowledged by the Council.

There are still major challenges that exist, such
as Al-Shabaab's terrorism in Somalia and the need
to make swift progress in the development of the
region and in improving the living standards of its
populations. Therefore, it was very important for the
Council and the international community in general to
recognize and adopt decisions that will encourage the
region to continue on the path towards achieving peace,
reconciliation and development.
