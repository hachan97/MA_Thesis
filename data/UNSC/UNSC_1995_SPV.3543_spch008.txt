Mr. Nobilo (Croatia): Mr. President, my delegation
is pleased to see you presiding over the proceedings of
the Security Council this month. We are confident that

 

your understanding of the problems in our region and your
generally recognized diplomatic skills will greatly
contribute to the current and forthcoming deliberations of
the Council.

I should also like to take this opportunity to pay a
tribute to Ambassador Jean-Bernard Merimee of France,
under whose prudent guidance the Council deliberated
during the month of May.

Croatia welcomes the efforts of the Security Council
and the international community to bring about a just and
peaceful solution to the crisis in the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, and will continue to contribute to this as
much as possible under the circumstances. With this in
mind, we support the draft resolution before us now in the
sincere hope that it will benefit the peace process in Bosnia
and Herzegovina.

Croatia welcomes the establishment of the rapid
reaction force and is ready to provide all the logistical
support required for its successful deployment. It is our
understanding that, while the rapid reaction force will use
some command and logistic facilities on the territory of the
Republic of Croatia, its theatre of operation will be
exclusively on the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. Regarding the possible use of the rapid
reaction force outside that theatre, the Croatian Government
is of the firm View that any operational use of the rapid
reaction force on the territory of the Republic of Croatia
may proceed only after consultations with my Government,
and with its prior approval and consent.
