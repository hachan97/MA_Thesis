The President (spoke in French): As this is the
last scheduled meeting of the Council for the month
of March 2015, I would like to express the sincere
appreciation of the delegation of France to the members
of the Council, especially my colleagues the Permanent
Representatives, their respective staff and to the
Secretariat of the Council, for all the support they have
provided.

It has been a busy month indeed, and one in
which we rallied to consensus on several important
issues within our purview. We could not have done it
alone and without the hard work, support and positive
contributions of every delegation and the representatives
of the Secretariat. I would like to thank the conference
service officers and our interpreters. They have done a
great deal for us.

As we end our presidency, I know I speak on behalf
of the Council in wishing the delegation of Jordan good
luck in the month of April.

The meeting rose at 5pm.
