Estonia voted against the draft resolution proposed by the Russian Federation for the renewal of cross-border aid mechanism to the Syrian Arab Republic. That text would not have supported Syrians, who are suffering following nine years of war and chemical attacks. Instead, Russia tried with that draft to twist the arms of the members of the Security Council into assisting Moscow in its pursuit of its political and military objectives. We saw it yesterday, when Russia and China vetoed the text of humanitarian co-penholders Belgium and Germany (see S/2020/661), and we see it again today with the proposed draft resolution (S/2020/658). Despite repeated calls by humanitarian non-governmental organizations and United Nations agencies to renew cross-border aid deliveries for one year, the Russian draft demanded a closure of yet another crossing of the current mechanism. However, according to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Bab Al-Salam is crucial for reaching hundreds of thousands of people in the outskirts of Aleppo. The attempt to decrease humanitarian aid to the most vulnerable communities in Syria in the light of the coronavirus disease outbreak is irresponsible. Estonia considers Russia's position unacceptable. Finally, we also want to underline that the rhetoric around unilateral coercive measures is purely politically motivated. European Union sanctions, in particular, do not have any considerable effect on humanitarian deliveries and activities inside Syria, as they target the elites in support of the Syrian regime. As such, we stress once again that Syria's current socioeconomic problems are a result of widespread corruption, warlordism and mismanagement. These are also the main reasons that multinational companies avoid doing business with Syria.
