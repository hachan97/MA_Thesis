Mr. Lopes Cabral (Guinea-Bissau) (interpretation from French): Very soon - only hours - after the
attempt to assassinate President Mubarak, Guinea-Bissau
condemned that act of terrorism. We consider that any

 

State offering passage, logistics or shelter to terrorists has
explicitly established its own complicity and thus bears
international responsibility.

As noted, my country has sponsored the draft
resolution before the Council. It did so not out of automatic
African solidarity but because of a position based on clear
principles. The Government of Guinea-Bissau is opposed to
terrorism and will spare no effort in attacking terrorism in
all its forms. This does not mean that we are about to make
a general statement on this matter, as we had an
opportunity, when resolutions 1044 (1996) and 1054 (1996)
were adopted, to discuss the question at length and clearly
to state our position.

However, as we are about to vote on this very
important draft resolution, I wish to take advantage of this
opportunity on behalf of my Government to reaffirm our
firm determination to contribute to the struggle against
international terrorism in all its forms. Today's draft
resolution is not aimed at the people of Sudan. As its
provisions indicate, it is intended to inform the Government
of Sudan that it must take the decision to bring to justice
the individuals implicated in this act of terrorism. In our
View, it is important that the Khartoum Government comply
with the draft resolution within 90 days so that we are not
forced once again to cite it for lack of respect for or non-
compliance with decisions of the Security Council, which
would oblige us to take measures that could be injurious to
the people of Sudan.

We hope that in the coming 90 days the Government
of Sudan and the Security Council will be able to affirm
that the provisions of the draft resolution have been
observed and that we are in a position to bring to justice
the individuals implicated in the attack.
