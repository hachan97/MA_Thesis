Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): During the course ofour discussions, a number
of my colleagues have given themselves poetic license.
I am especially forced to return to the statement made
by the representative of the United States. Ms. Powers
started with a reference to Tolstoy and Chekhov and
finished by lowering herself to the level of the tabloid
press. It is simply unacceptable to listen to such insults
addressed to our country. If the delegation of the
United States of America expects our cooperation in
the Security Council on other issues, Ms. Powers must
understand that quite clearly.
