Mr. Rugunda (Uganda): I welcome His
Excellency President Ismail Omar Guelleh of Djibouti
and thank him for his comprehensive and insightful
statement on several issues pertaining to the Horn of
Africa. His address has come at an opportune time,
when the Council is seized with peace and security
issues in the region, including the border dispute
between Djibouti and Eritrea, the situation in Somalia
and the fight against piracy off the coast of Somalia.

Uganda underscores the need for the peaceful
resolution of conflicts in the region to ensure durable
peace and security. In that regard, we take this
opportunity to commend President Guelleh for the
positive role Djibouti is playing in the region,
especially through the Djibouti peace process that has
led to the current Transitional Federal Government
(TFG), Parliament and other institutions that are
striving to restore stability in Somalia.

We are convinced that the Djibouti peace process
represents the best opportunity for lasting peace in
Somalia. We therefore commend the continuing efforts
of Djibouti in supporting the TFG, especially in the
security sector, and its recent mediation efforts aimed
at promoting reconciliation in Somalia.

In January and December 2009, the Security
Council adopted resolutions 1862 (2009) and 1907
(2009), respectively. We commend Djibouti for
fulfilling its obligations under those resolutions and its
commitment to finding a peaceful resolution to the
border conflict with Eritrea. It is regrettable that all
efforts to get similar cooperation from Eritrea have not
yet been successful. We call upon Eritrea to comply
with its obligations, as spelled out in Security Council
resolutions, to promote peace and stability in the
region.
