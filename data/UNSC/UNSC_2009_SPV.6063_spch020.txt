Mr. Zhang Yesui (China) (spoke in Chinese): We
wish to thank the parties concerned for their tireless
efforts to reach a consensus on the text of resolution
1860 (2009). Since the outbreak of the conflict, we
have consistently supported swift action by the Council
to adopt a resolution urging the parties concerned to
bring about an immediate ceasefire, open border
crossings and ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

While we believe that the resolution we adopted
this evening is not totally satisfactory, we nevertheless
voted in favour, given the gravity and urgency of
developments on the ground. The resolution reflects
the shared expectations and common aspirations of the
international community.

We urge the parties concerned to achieve an
immediate ceasefire and to implement the resolution in
a comprehensive and effective manner so as to avoid
causing more civilian casualties and a humanitarian
crisis. We hope the international community will work
to bring the parties concerned back to the track of
negotiations and to achieve a just and durable solution
to the Israeli-Palestinian question.
