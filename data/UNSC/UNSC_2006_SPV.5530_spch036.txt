Mr. Abbas (Palestine) (spoke in Arabic): I am
delighted to attend this meeting of the highest body in
the international community, which holds the fate of
the world in its hands, and I am sure that it is in the
safest possible hands. On this occasion, allow me to
sincerely thank you for agreeing to convene this
meeting to consider the situation in the Middle East,
including the question of Palestine. If this meeting
shows anything, it shows that the world wants to reach
a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict as quickly as
possible, in order to eradicate a source of tension that
affects all aspects of life, not just in the Middle East,
but also in the rest of the world.

Naturally, this meeting was convened in response
to an initiative by the League of Arab States and its
Secretary-General, my brother Amr Moussa. I would
like to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to
all those who have spoken so far. I have been made
keenly aware that the representatives present here want
to reach a just, comprehensive and permanent
settlement of the conflict in the Middle East, and I
really hope that their sincere, lofty words will be
06-52982
followed by concrete deeds leading to the achievement
of a settlement, namely, the establishment of a
Palestinian State living side by side with the State of
Israel.

As my brothers in the Arab world had agreed, the
Foreign Minister of Bahrain took the floor to speak on
our behalf and expressed our common position. He
stated what we deep down wish to see.

I have nothing to add to what he said in that
regard. I would just add that we are fully committed to
peace through negotiations. We are committed to
international legitimacy, to the road map of the Quartet
and to living with our neighbours in peace and security.

I will stop here, Madam President, as I have a
rather lengthy statement to deliver in the General
Assembly in one hour. Thank you all very much.
