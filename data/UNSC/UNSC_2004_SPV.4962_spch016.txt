Mr. King (United Kingdom): Through you, Sir,
we would like to take this opportunity to thank the
German presidency for its work last month. Like
others, we offer you best wishes for this month.

We are grateful for today's debate and for
Mr. Tiirk's briefing. The United Kingdom
congratulates all those in-country, from the region and
others involved on the progress achieved so far in the
peace process. This progress is a testament to the
determination of the Bougainville parties to move the
peace process forward, with the assistance of the
reconfigured United Nations Mission led by
Mr. Stenbock. Like others, we would like to take this
opportunity to recognize also the work of his
predecessor, Mr. Sinclair.

We welcome the fact that, as we have heard, a
significant percentage of weapons have been destroyed
under the weapons disposal plan; that several districts
are now clear of weapons; that the work on the
constitution is moving ahead; and that there has been
progress in police training, even if that remains a
priority. That said, it is clear from some recent
incidents, such as the theft of sealed weapons, that
continued determination and vigilance, as well as
continued international support, will be required over
the coming months to keep up the momentum in the
face of any setbacks.

Finally, we welcome and support the aim of the
Government and others in Papua New Guinea to work
towards elections for a new Government in the time
frame indicated by Mr. Tiirk.
