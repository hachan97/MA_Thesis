Mr. Moreno-Ocampo: With due respect for the
Council and the Government of the Sudan, it is my duty
as Prosecutor to inform the Council and to put on notice
the Ambassador of the Sudan, Mr. Daffa-Alla Elhag Ali
Osman, that in accordance with article 25 3(d) of the
Rome Statute, his activities denying crimes in Darfur
could be considered part of those crimes. The Office
has an obligation to investigate anyone responsible for
the commission of crimes. The Office will therefore
investigate if Mr. Daffa-Alla Elhag Ali Osman's
denial of the crimes committed could be considered a
contribution to a group of perpetrators acting with a
common purpose.

Since Nuremberg, it has been clear that obeying
illegal orders is not a valid excuse for the commission
of crimes. The Office will respect Mr. Osman's rights
and invite him to present any exculpatory information,
and it will check his intentions, including if he was
aiming to further the criminal purposes of a group of
perpetrators in Darfur. In that case, the Office will not
hesitate to take appropriate action if the evidence leads
to the conclusion that he is participating in the crimes.
