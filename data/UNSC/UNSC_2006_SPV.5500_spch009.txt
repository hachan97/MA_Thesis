Mr. Mayoral (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish):
Argentina voted in favour of today's resolution bearing
in mind that the text adopted reaffirms the right of
every State signatory of the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, in conformity with
articles I and II of the Treaty, to develop research,
production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful
purposes without discrimination.

Furthermore, my delegation earnestly hopes that
a diplomatic solution negotiated with the Government
of Iran will be achieved. That is why we call on the
parties involved to resume the dialogue in order to find
a solution within the framework of arrangement, with
the Board of Governors of the International Atomic
Energy Agency and by the Security Council with
regard to the Iran nuclear issue.
