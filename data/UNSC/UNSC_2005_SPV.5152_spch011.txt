Mr. Holliday (United States of America): We
would like to thank Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz
Pahad for his work and for his briefing to us today. We
also thank Alan Doss for presenting the report of the
Secretary-General (S/2005/186) and for his work in
Cote d'Ivoire.

We welcome the Secretary-General's latest
progress report. We are reviewing it carefully. We
would like to commend the work of President Thabo
Mbeki in his efforts to mediate between the parties in
Cote d'Ivoire, as well as the work of the African Union
in addressing the crisis.

We call on all Ivorian parties to respect their
commitments under the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement,
which has been called into question several times
during the past year. We particularly urge the parties to
demonstrate a true commitment to peace and
reconciliation in the upcoming emergency talks to be
held in Pretoria in early April.

We remain concerned about the humanitarian
situation and, obviously, about the vulnerable
population that is affected by this conflict.

In our review of the Secretary-General's latest
report, we of course will be looking at all aspects. We
continue to have questions about the utility of
expanding the strength of the United Nations Operation
in Cote d'Ivoire (UNOCI) beyond its current mandate,
given the lack of political will shown so far by the
parties to move the peace process forward. We do,
however, believe that it is absolutely critical to see
progress, and that UNOCI should consider using all the
tools at its disposal.

Finally, we call upon all the parties to reduce the
level of violence and the level of unconstructive
rhetoric, as well as to renew their commitment to the
rule of law. I would also like to commend the mission
in Cote d'Ivoire for its work to address the issue of
sexual exploitation and abuse. We look forward to
working with our Council colleagues on this critical
issue.
