The President: As this is the first meeting of the
Security Council for the month of December, I should like
to take the opportunity to pay tribute, on behalf of the
Council, to His Excellency Mr. Danilo Turk, Permanent
Representative of Slovenia to the United Nations, for his
service as President of the Security Council for the month
of November 1999. I am sure I speak for all members of
the Council in expressing our deep appreciation to
Ambassador Turk for the great diplomatic skill with which
he conducted the Council's business last month.
