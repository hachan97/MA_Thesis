The President: There are no more names inscribed
on the list of speakers. I would like to thank our
conference officers for their tireless work today,
particularly rounding up Member States when they
were perhaps not in their places when they should have
been. As ever, I would like to thank our colleagues from
the Security Council Affairs Division and, of course,
our fantastic interpreters.

The meeting rose at 5.30pm.
