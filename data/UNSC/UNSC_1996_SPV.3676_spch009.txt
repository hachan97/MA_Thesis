Sir John Weston (United Kingdom): The
establishment of the United Nations Support Mission in
Haiti (UNSMIH) in the draft resolution we are about to
adopt confirms this Council's support for the efforts of
the Haitian people to consolidate their hard-won
democracy.

The British Government is pleased that UNSMIH
will continue the valuable work of the United Nations
Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) in providing the necessary
climate for continuing peace and stability. We are
particularly grateful to those who have contributed troops

 

and civilian personnel to UNMIH, and to those who intend
to continue their support for UNSMIH. We welcome the
fact that it has been possible to reduce the force level
substantially.

The key task facing the Support Mission will be the
continuation of efforts to establish an effective National
Police force. While good progress has been made, the job
is not yet done. The role of the United Nations civilian
police will be crucial, and we encourage the international
community to continue to support their efforts. We
commend the Haitian Government's commitment to the
maintenance of peace and law and order. We must all now
work with them to ensure that governmental and judicial
institutions are strengthened to give Haiti the necessary
foundations for a stable and lasting democracy.

Haiti's road to democracy has been long and arduous.
The international community and this Council can be proud
of their support for the efforts of the Haitian people. Haiti
is rightly described as a success story for the United
Nations. But we must not be complacent. We need to
ensure that the task is completed. The United Kingdom will
continue its effort and support for that task.
