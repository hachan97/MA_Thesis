The President: Let me assure all participants that
Romania will continue to have a very active and
educative role in this respect. I am convinced that our
debate is leading in that direction. As well, I add my
voice to some of the issues expressed here. Sudan and
Darfur is a case in point, and the next few days will be
decisive in that regard. I also welcome the remarks of
the representative of the United States about the role of
women and the relation between HIV/AIDS and
peacekeeping, as well as his remarks about failed
States.
