Mr. Adejola (Nigeria): I thank the Chair of the
Security Council Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1737 (2006) for his presentation of the latest
90-day report of the Committee.

Nigeria takes due cognizance of the fact that there
were no new incidents reported to the Committee in the
period covered by the report. My delegation commends
the Committee for its continued engagement, in
particular in the area of assistance to States and
international organizations in the implementation of the
relevant Security Council measures relating to sanctions
under resolution 1737 (2006). Indeed, that aspect of the
Committee's work is in line with the efforts to protect
the integrity of the decisions taken by the Council and
to ensure that States do not unknowingly flout the
sanctions regime under resolution 1737 (2006). We
reiterate the useful purposes served when States seek
appropriate guidance from the Committee on proposals
for technical cooperation with Iran in matters under the
purview of Committee's work and the merits of such an
approach.

Regarding past requests made by the Committee
on two incidents investigated by the Panel of Experts,
we continue to urge Iran to respond to those requests
as a demonstration of respect for the decisions of the
Committee. We commend the efforts of the Panel
of Experts, which have contributed significantly to
the work of the Committee. That is indeed reflected
positively in its final report (S/2015/401).

Finally, we continue to monitor and encourage
the negotiations between the United States and Iran
and between the P5+l and Iran aimed at working out a
comprehensive solution of the Iranian nuclear issues. We
believe that it is in the interest of all to remain focused,
constructive and committed to the negotiations.
