Mr. Aisi (Papua New Guinea): May I join others
in welcoming President Gusmao and Foreign Minister
Ramos-Horta to the United Nations.

I also congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption
of the presidency of the Council and thank the United
Kingdom for its sterling efforts in December.

I take pleasure in speaking today on behalf of the
Pacific Islands Forum member countries Australia, the
Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, the
Marshall Islands, Palau, Nauru, New Zealand, Samoa,
Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and my own
country, Papua New Guinea, along with the observer
members.
Especially pleasing is the fact that Timor-Leste is
currently an observer member of the Pacific Islands
Forum.

To date, many of the participants in the military
and civilian police personnel have come from Pacific
Islands Forum countries, namely, Australia, New
Zealand, Fiji, Palau, Samoa and Vanuatu. Other
countries, such as Papua New Guinea, have also made
small contributions in other areas.

As alluded to by my colleagues previously, much
has been achieved and much more needs to be done.
We commend the work of the Special Representative,
Mr. Sukehiro Hasegawa. We also encourage the good
work that continues to be carried out by the United
Nations agencies.

We recognize the efforts of President Gusmao's
Government and the people of Timor-Leste to
consolidate peace on their road to achieving
development and prosperity.

In closing, we wish the Government and people
of Timor-Leste well and look forward to seeing further
consolidated the good progress being made. We agree
with our colleagues - especially, in this case,
Australia - that we must all remain committed to
supporting Timor-Leste in its transition to secure and
self-reliant statehood.
