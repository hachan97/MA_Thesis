Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): You misunderstood me, Madam President.
We stand ready to agree to the publication of a report
that objectively reflects Russian concerns. Let me once
again draw your attention to the fact that you are the
ones preventing its dissemination. There is no other
version of the report other than what the Panel of
Experts has conveyed to the Security Council, which
you have blocked. Therefore, Madam President, when
you ask to revert to the original version, you are the
ones who are exerting pressure on the Panel of Experts.

You perhaps did not listen to me attentively enough,
Madam President, or perhaps your further statement
was written beforehand. The lies and denials in our
statement to which you have liked to refer to so much
recently, as well as other insinuations shamelessly made
against our country, were absent from our statement.
What we did was to describe the reasons, very clearly
and in great detail, as to why we agreed, along with
other experts and including American experts, that
the report should include the changes that reflect our
concerns. That is a simple statement of fact. What you
are trying to do is to intentionally ascribe political ill-
intent. I also have a request for you, Madam President:
please lift the hold on the report of the Panel of Experts
and make sure that it sees the light of day.

The meeting rose at 12.10p.m.
