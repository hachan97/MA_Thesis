The President: Once again, I appeal to speakers
with longer statements to circulate the texts of their
statements to delegations and to limit their
interventions to no more than five minutes so that we
can accommodate all speakers by the end of the day. I
thank participants for their understanding.

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Lam
Akol Ajawin, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Sudan.
