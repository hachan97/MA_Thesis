The President: In a debate in which we have
discussed the gap between humanitarian and structural
aid, I am grateful to the representative of the Gambia
for mentioning the gap between pledges and
disbursements. His point is well taken.

The next speaker is the representative of Senegal.
I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to
make his statement.
