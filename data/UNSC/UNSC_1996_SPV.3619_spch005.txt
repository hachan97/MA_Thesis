The President: I thank Mr. Jovanovic' for his kind
words addressed to me.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to vote on the two draft resolutions before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolutions
to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council who
wish to make statements before the voting.
