Mr. Ipo (Cote d'Ivoire) (spoke in French): At the
outset, we would like to wish you, Madam President,
and your team every success during your presidency
of the Security Council. We also commend the
United Kingdom for its exemplary presidency and
its constructive approach in guiding the work of the
Council during the month of August.

My delegation expresses its full support for the
provisional programme of work proposed by the United
States, including the briefing on Nicaragua in the light
of the developing crisis in that country and its impact in
the region in the context of preventive diplomacy.

In conclusion, we look forward to a rich and
constructive month of September under the presidency
of your country, Madam President.
