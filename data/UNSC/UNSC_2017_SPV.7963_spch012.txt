Mr. Zhang Dianbin (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China has listened to the briefing by Prosecutor
Bensouda. Since last year, there has been marked
improvement in the political and security situation in
Darfur. The Sudanese Government has been actively
dedicated to promoting the peace process and has
worked hard to safeguard Darfur's stability and advance
its reconstruction. China commends those efforts.
Political settlement is the only solution to the
situation in Darfur. The international community
should provide active support to the mediation efforts
of the African Union High-level Implementation Panel,
step up its assistance to the Sudanese Government,
armed groups and opposition parties of the area in the
implementation of the road map agreement, and urge
the Sudan Liberation Army/Abdul Wahid to join the
peace process without conditions so as to resolve their
differences through dialogue, in pursuit ofa lasting and
peaceful solution to the situation in Darfur.

The international community should uphold an
objective and fair position, respect the sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity of the Sudan and
play a constructive role in the political settlement ofthe
situation in Darfur. China's position on the handling
of the situation in the Sudan by the International
Criminal Court remains unchanged. China believes
that the legitimate concerns of the African Union
and the Sudanese Government on the Court's
handling of the situation in the Sudan should be given
adequate attention.
