Mr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): The Ukrainian
delegation decided to co-sponsor resolution 2307
(2016), adopted today, for the following reasons.

Ukraine welcomes the Final Agreement for the
Termination of Conflict and the Construction of a Stable
and Lasting Peace reached between the Government of
Colombia and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias
de Colombia-Ejercito del Pueblo, which has been
achieved after almost four years of formal negotiations.
President Juan Manuel Santos Calderon said that the
peace agreement represented the beginning of the end
of the suffering, pain and tragedy of war and that it
brought an end to more than 50 years of armed conflict
in Colombia.

In the spirit of strong support for a stable and long-
lasting peace in the Republic of Colombia, Ukraine
welcomes today's resolution, which endorsed the
report (S/2016/729) of the Secretary-General and his
recommendations on the mandate of the United Nations
mission in Colombia. We also express our appreciation
to the British delegation for its leadership and efficient
work in preparing the draft and conducting negotiations.

The Security Council should continue to play a
proactive role in supporting the parties as they advance
in implementing the provisions of the Final Agreement,
as well as ensuring the effective functioning of the
tripartite monitoring and verification mechanism.

We believe that the Colombian experience of
engaging the United Nations as the international
component of the tripartite mechanism will be a
success story that will bring stability to the region and
become an example for other parts ofthe world affected
by lasting conflict.
