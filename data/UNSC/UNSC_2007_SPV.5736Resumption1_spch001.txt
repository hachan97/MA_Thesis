The President (spoke in French): I wish to
remind all of the speakers, as I indicated at the
morning session, that they are requested to limit their
statements to no more than five minutes in order to
enable the Council to efficiently carry out its work.
Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to deliver a condensed version when
speaking in the Chamber and to circulate the longer
written text.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Norway.
