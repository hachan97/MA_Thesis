The President: As this is the first meeting of the
Security Council for the month of September, may I
begin by paying a particular tribute on behalf of all of
us to His Excellency Ambassador Mikhail Wehbe,
Permanent Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic
to the United Nations, for his very distinguished and
very important service as President of the Council in
the month of August. I am sure I speak for all of us in
expressing our appreciation of the role which
Ambassador Wehbe and Ambassador Mekdad both
carried out.

In particular, I would like to express every best
wish to Ambassador Wehbe, who after a long period of
service to his country at the United Nations in New
York, is now going to move on to another part of the
United Nations family. We have no doubt that he will
continue to carry on his work with the same distinction
in Geneva as he has done in New York. We wish him
every success and the best of luck in that appointment.
