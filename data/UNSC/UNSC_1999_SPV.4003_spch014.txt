Mr. Moura (Brazil): The humanitarian situation in
and around Kosovo is a matter of universal concern. The
Security Council is quite aware of the suffering of hundreds
of thousands of people in the Balkans. We had hoped,
therefore, that the dramatic humanitarian situation in the
region would lead to a consensual response on the part of
the Council.

The stated purpose of this resolution, which Brazil co-
sponsored and for which we worked together with the
members of the Non-Aligned Movement caucus, was to
serve as a bridge between positions and to help build unity
within the Council in responding to the crisis in Kosovo. In
this respect, we insist both on the linkage between the
deterioration of the humanitarian situation and on the
absence of a political solution to the crisis and a
reaffirmation of the role of the Security Council in the
search for that solution.

While we regret that a full convergence of views was
not possible over the terms of the resolution, we are pleased
that the Council was able to adopt the resolution, the main
thrust of which is to support unconditionally the efforts of
the United Nations and humanitarian agencies in assisting
the needs of the thousands of people in distress all over the
region. It does not address the crucial question of a final
resolution of the conflict, as the elements for that,
unfortunately are not yet in the hands of the Council.

I wish to underline the importance of the step taken
tonight by the Council and to express the hope that this
expression of common concern will help us achieve in the
near future greater involvement by the Security Council in
the political resolution of the Kosovo crisis.
