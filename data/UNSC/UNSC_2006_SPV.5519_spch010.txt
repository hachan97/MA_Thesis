Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): During the work on the draft resolution we
have just adopted, the Russian delegation did
everything possible to help achieve a peaceful
diplomatic settlement of the situation in Darfur - a
situation that is complex in every respect.

It is of fundamental importance that the
resolution clearly states the overriding need for the
consent of the Government of National Unity of the
Sudan for the deployment of a United Nations
peacekeeping mission in Darfur in accordance with
decisions of the Security Council and of the African
Union. Such consent has yet to be received. To obtain
it, we must continue constructive dialogue with the
Sudanese leadership. We consider that the Security
Council meeting planned for early September, with the
participation of representatives of the Sudanese
leadership, the African Union, the League of Arab
States and the Organization of the Islamic Conference,
will provide a good opportunity for that.

It is important that the Security Council support
the Secretary-General's plan for a phased transition of
the African Union Mission in the Sudan (AMIS) under
the auspices of the United Nations. The first phase
would involve enhancing the quality and effectiveness
of AMIS, to be followed by the deployment of United
Nations peacekeepers - but, I repeat, with the consent
of the Sudanese Government.

Pending the receipt of such consent, the Russian
delegation decided to abstain in the vote on today's
draft resolution, although we have no objections in
principle to its content. We will continue to contribute
to establishing full-scale cooperation between
Khartoum and the United Nations in order to attain an
effective settlement of the situation in Darfur on the
basis of the Abuja Agreement and the normalization of
the humanitarian situation in that province of the
Sudan.
