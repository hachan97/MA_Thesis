Mr. Boubacar Diallo (Guinea) (spoke in French): I would like to join preceding speakers in
expressing my delegation's full appreciation to Mr.
James Morris for his very rich and instructive briefing
on the food crisis in Africa. The last time Mr. Morris
spoke to the Council on this issue was on 3 December
2002. The briefing that he has just given leads to the
general impression that the picture is far from rosy.
Rather, it is the opposite. The food situation in Africa
is becoming increasingly alarming due, as he said, to
several causes that vary from one area to another and
from one country to another.
My question relates to the approach that must be
adopted to solve the food crisis in Africa. Is there
coordination among the various actors involved in the
fight for food security in Africa? If there is, how does
it function? If there is not, could a viable mechanism
be put in place to make this fight more effective?
