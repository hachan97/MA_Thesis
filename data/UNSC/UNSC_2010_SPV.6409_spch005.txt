The President: I thank Mr. Lamamra for his
statement.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers
to limit their statements to no more than five minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate their texts in writing and
to read a condensed version when speaking in the
chamber.

I shall now give the floor to the members of the
Security Council.
