The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the
representative of South Africa for his statement, and in
particular for the congratulations he conveyed to
Colombia about the Copa America success. I know that
he celebrated Colombia's victory as though he was
Colombian. Of course, other ambassadors were not
quite as happy with the success of Colombia, but it was
still generally celebrated. Once again, many thanks.

The next speaker on my list is the representative
of New Zealand. I invite him to take a seat at the
Council table and make his statement.
