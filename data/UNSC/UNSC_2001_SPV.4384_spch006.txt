Mr. Ryan (Ireland): The Irish Government has
taken note of and welcomes the steps taken by the
Government of Sudan to comply with the provisions of
Security Council resolutions 1054 (1996) and 1070
(1996). As the requirements for lifting the sanctions
have now been met, my Government agrees with the
terms of the resolution before us.

While the Security Council is today
acknowledging that the very specific requirements for
the lifting of the sanctions have been met, and for that
reason the sanctions are being lifted, the Irish
Government remains deeply concerned at the wider
political, humanitarian and human rights situation in
the Sudan. We call on the Government of the Sudan to
cease immediately any targeting of the civilian
population and to allow the safe delivery of
humanitarian assistance to those in need. We urge the
Government of the Sudan to engage urgently in serious
negotiations, through the Intergovernmental Authority
on Development process, on a just and lasting political
settlement to the conflict in the Sudan and to negotiate
a comprehensive ceasefire.
