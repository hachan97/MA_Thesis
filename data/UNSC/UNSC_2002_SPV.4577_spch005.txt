The President: Mr. Minister, thank you for your
very thoughtful analysis of the issues. Could I ask you
two questions? First, could you say where you think
mistakes on Sierra Leone were made by the
international community in the years running up to the
crisis and also in the last couple of years? As well, in
your statement, you mentioned the particular situation
of refugees and the ways in which you feel that this can
continue to fuel instability. Could you say something
about what you think the international community
should be doing to support Sierra Leone and the other
countries in the region with respect to the situation of
refugees?
