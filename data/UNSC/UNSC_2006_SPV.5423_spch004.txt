Mr. Bolton (United States): We believe that this
vote today constituted an important first step in the
Security Council fulfilling its responsibilities under the
several resolutions respecting Darfur that it has
adopted. This resolution demonstrates that the Security
Council is serious in its effort to restore peace and
security in the region and that, far from interfering in
the peace process in Abuja, it will strengthen that
process. We regret that the vote today was not
unanimous, but we do not think that that will deter the
Security Council from continuing to fulfil its
responsibilities.
