Mr. Wang Yingfan (China)(sp0ke in Chinese):
Given the lateness of the hour, I would like to associate
myself with the statements and assessments on this
month's work given by other colleagues.

I wish to touch on one point regarding the
Council's working methods concerning the month of
June. During the month of June, Ambassador
Greenstock held a lunch party and carried out informal
discussions on improving the Council's working
methods of the Council. I am very glad to note that a
lunch party will also be held in the month of July, and
Ambassador Mahbubani is going to host that lunch

party.

We had a very heavy schedule in the month of
June. We debated several issues. With regard to
enhancing transparency, I must say that we did that
very well for the month June. However, we still have
expectations about other issues. We need more time to
prepare for the issues to be discussed, so that we may
have a discussion of the items and highlight our
greatest concerns.

Ambassador Levitte mentioned that follow-up
actions or discussions need to be taken. There is a
problem with how to schedule the work for a given
month. I do not think it is possible to work from early
morning late into the night, from Monday through
Friday. Therefore, we must address this question. I
would like to invite all members to give proper thought
to this problem and to attend the informal consultations
to be hosted by Ambassador Mahbubani.
