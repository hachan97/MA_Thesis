Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
First, I would like to thank the Under-Secretary-
General for Humanitarian Affairs, Mr. Kenzo Oshima,
for his briefing. As he said, the humanitarian situation
in Angola is very serious.

As a result of many years of war and turmoil,
almost a third of the population has been internally
displaced: those four million people are in dire need of
assistance from the international community. Thus,
there are 4 million internally displaced persons and 2
million others who badly need assistance from the
international community. Therefore, the international
community has to do its best to provide assistance and
relief to the Angolan people.

It is encouraging that post-conflict peace-building
is on track; the general situation in Angola is
developing positively and prospects for peace also
appear to be good. In order to consolidate peace in
Angola, the international community must help the
Government heal the wounds of war, improve its
management, resolve economic difficulties and raise
the standard of living of the people.
