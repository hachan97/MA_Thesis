The President: The Security Council will now

Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Following consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council unequivocally
condemns the terrorist bomb attack that took
place on 9 May 2004 in Grozny, the Russian
Federation, as a result of which many people
were injured and killed, including the President
of the Chechen Republic of the Russian
Federation, Akhmad Kadyrov.

"The Security Council condemns also in the
strongest terms the perpetrators of this heinous
act committed against innocent people at the
stadium when celebrating the Victory Day - the
most solemn national holiday in the Russian
Federation.

"The Security Council expresses its deepest
sympathy and condolences to the people and to
the Government of the Russian Federation and to
the victims and their families.

"The Security Council urges all States, in
accordance with their obligation under resolution
1373 (2001), to cooperate with the Russian
authorities in their efforts to bring to justice the
perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of this
attack.

"The Security Council reaffirms that
terrorism in all its forms and manifestations
constitutes one of the most serious threats to
international peace and security and that any acts
of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable,
regardless of their motivation, whenever and by
whomsoever committed.

"The Security Council expresses its
determination to combat all forms of terrorism, in
accordance with its responsibilities under the
Charter of the United Nations."
This statement will be issued as a document of the
