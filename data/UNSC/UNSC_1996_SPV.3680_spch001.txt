The President (interpretation from French): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Georgia and Ireland, in which they
request to be invited to participate in the discussion of the
item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the discussion,
without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Chkheidze
(Georgia) took a seat at the Council table;
Mr. Campbell (Ireland) took the seat reserved for him
at the side of the Council Chamber.

The President (interpretation from French): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General concerning the situation in
Abkhazia, Georgia, documents S/ 1996/507 and Add.l.
Members of the Council also have before them document
S/ 1996/544, which contains the text of a draft resolution
prepared in the course of the Council's prior consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to the following documents: S/ 1996/371, letter
dated 23 May 1996 from the Permanent Representative of
the Russian Federation to the United Nations addressed to
the Secretary-General; and S/ 1996/527, letter dated 8 July
1996 from the Permanent Representative of Georgia to the
United Nations addressed to the President of the Security
Council, transmitting a letter dated 6 July 1996 from the
President of Georgia addressed to the President of the
Security Council.

The first speaker is the representative of Georgia,
and I now call on him.
