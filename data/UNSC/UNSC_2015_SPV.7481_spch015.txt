Mr. Gimolieca (Angola): Angola abstained in
the voting today on the draft resolution submitted by
the United Kingdom on Srebrenica for the following
reasons.

First, Angola does not take a position of denial
on the issue. Whether we call it mass murder, mass
atrocities or genocide, the fact is that we acknowledge
that on 11 July 1995, extremely grave events took
place in Srebrenica that are tantamount to the crime
of genocide, as was recognized by the International
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.

Our fundamental disagreement stems from the fact
that the text of the draft resolution should take into
account, in the same manner, the many thousands of
victims of massacres from all over the region during
the war on the territory that was later to become the
independent State of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

It had been our expectation that the text would take
stock of the level of reconciliation and cooperation
among the States and communities in the region and
look forward to a future of peace, to healing and
reconciliation and the building of a better future for
all of the peoples made neighbours by geography and
history to share the past, the present and the future.

Twenty years after the events in the former
Yugoslavia, such a draft resolution would not make any
tangible contribution to the ongoing and still-fragile
process of reconciliation and could have a negative
impact on the efforts of the responsible leaders of the
Balkan States to create a better common future, which
have already produced significant results. It had been
our expectation that the final text of the draft resolution
would translate a required level of compromise among
the members of the Security Council, permitting a
consensual text in which all members would recognize
themselves.

We would further wish to see a draft resolution
focusing on positive aspects, addressing genuine
reconciliation, dealing with the past as a lesson to be
learned and seeking a future-oriented approach by
helping the region to face the needs of the present and
the future by encouraging, facilitating and accelerating
the process of reconciliation and cooperation in the
Balkans.
