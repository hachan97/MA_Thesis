The President: I thank Her Excellency
Mme Pierre-Louis for her dynamic statement and her
outstanding leadership in Haiti. I want to thank again
President Clinton. He must leave to go to another
commitment, but I want to reiterate our gratitude to
him before he goes and thank him for his presence here
today.
In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers
to limit their statements to no more than five minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing and to
deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.

I shall now give the floor to the members of the
Security Council.
