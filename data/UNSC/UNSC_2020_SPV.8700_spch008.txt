Mr. Pecsteen de Buytswerve (Belgium) (spoke in French): We would like to thank all the members of the Council that voted in favour of resolution 2504 (2020). As I said earlier, the text is a compromise one that will make it possible to continue humanitarian assistance in the north-west of Syria, where there is no alternative way of receiving such humanitarian assistance. As the Council is aware, the system functions on the basis of a simple notification to the Syrian authorities. This is an important signal for the Syrian people. Along with Germany and numerous _ other delegations around this table, we had hoped for and worked extremely hard to achieve a more far-reaching result, a mandate for all persons who depend on the mechanism. We are therefore extremely disappointed at and deeply regret the fact that the Council was not able to achieve such a result on a resolution that is purely humanitarian in nature. We call on the Syrian authorities to respect international humanitarian law, protect their citizens and enable the delivery of humanitarian assistance throughout the whole of the territory in a neutral manner and without any impediments.
