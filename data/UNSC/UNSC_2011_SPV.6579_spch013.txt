The President: I shall now make a statement in
my national capacity.

Germany welcomes the unanimous adoption of
the resolution on the drawdown of the United Nations
Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS). The Council thereby
confirms the end of the mandate for UNMIS in the
3
Sudan and reiterates the existing legal framework, as
agreed to between the Government of the Sudan and
the United Nations, for the liquidation of the Mission.

We call on the relevant authorities in the Sudan to
fully respect the provisions of the status-of-forces
agreement of December 2005 and to ensure that all
steps are being taken for an orderly and smooth
withdrawal of all UNMIS forces.

We agree with the previous speakers that there is
a need for a United Nations presence in the north,
especially the border areas. We are deeply concerned
about the ongoing violence, especially in Southern
Kordofan. We call on the Government of the Sudan and
the Sudan People's Liberation Movement North to
immediately cease all hostilities and stop attacks on the
civilian population. We especially condemn all
airstrikes against villages in Southern Kordofan.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.
