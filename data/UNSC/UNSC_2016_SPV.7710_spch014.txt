Mr. Shen Bo (China) (spoke in Chinese): China has
taken note of Prosecutor Bensouda's briefing.

At present, the Darfur region of the Sudan is still
facing such problems as the slowness of progress in its
political process and armed groups resorting to violent
means to disrupt peace and stability in the region. China

appreciates the efforts of the African Union High-Level
Implementation Panel (AUHIP) to engage in diplomatic
good offices to actively promote the political settlement
of the Darfur question. We welcome the fact that the
Sudanese Government has signed the road map proposal
submitted by the AUHIP. It is hoped that it will lead
the opposition and armed groups, proceeding from the
broad perspective of maintaining peace and stability in
the Sudan, to quickly sign the road map proposal and the
Doha Document for Peace in Darfur in a common effort
to seek a comprehensive and political settlement of the
Darfur question. The international community should
adopt an objective and fair position, play a constructive
role and create favourable external conditions for the
political settlement of the Darfur question.

On the question of the Sudan and the ICC, China's
position has not changed. We welcome the fact that
the African Union (AU) has established a ministerial
committee to deal with the question of the Sudan at
the ICC. We support the holding of dialogue between
the Council and the AU ministerial committee so as
the voices of African countries may be heard and their
concerns accommodated. We believe that the legitimate
concerns of the AU and its members, including the
Sudanese Government, on ICC-related questions,
should be fully heeded.
