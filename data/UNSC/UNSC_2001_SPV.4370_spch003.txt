Sir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom):
Yesterday's events took us to a place beyond our
imagining. The United Kingdom is united in deep
shock and sympathy for the people of the United States
and in the determination to eradicate terrorism globally,
in cooperation with and in support of the United States.
Her Majesty the Queen expressed to President Bush
yesterday, on behalf of the British people, her heartfelt
sympathy for the very many bereaved and injured and
her admiration for those - let us remember this -
who are now trying to cope with the unfolding tragedy
of what has happened.

The international spirit of response, I think, was
also exemplified by the European Union in a meeting
of ministers this morning, who said that these
horrendous acts are an attack not only on the United
States, but against humanity itself and the values and
freedoms we all share. But the life and work of our
open and democratic societies will continue undeterred.
My Prime Minister has expressed similar sentiments
and calls us to understand that mass terrorism is the
new evil in our world today, perpetrated by fanatics
who are utterly indifferent to the sanctity of human
life.
We support the substance of the draft resolution
that the Council is to consider. We all have to
understand that this is a global issue, an attack on the
whole of modern civilization and an affront to the
human spirit. We must all respond globally and show
the strength of that spirit.
