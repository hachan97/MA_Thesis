Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation abstained in the
voting on resolution 2216 (2015), concerning the
conflict in Yemen, as, in our view, it is not fully in
line with the requirements that were put forth to the
international community or dictated by the current
crisis in the country.

During consultations on the resolution, the
constructive proposals of the Russian delegation were
not given due consideration. The resolution refers to the
need to resume negotiations between the parties to the
Yemeni conflict, and expresses support to the relevant
United Nations efforts. However, the ponsors refused
to include the requirements insisted upon by Russia,
which were addressed to all parties to the conflict, to
swiftly halt fire and begin peace talks.

The resolution contains no due reflection on the
difficulties caused by the fighting for Yemeni civilians,
nor does it provide a sufficiently clear expression of
the instatement of obligations or regular humanitarian
pauses.

Given the situation in Yemen, the resolution makes
inappropriate reference to the sanctions aspect. We
insisted on the necessity of a comprehensive arms
embargo. It is well known that Yemen is awash in
weapons. In that regard, we think it necessary to stress
that the resolution adopted should not be used to further
escalate the armed conflict, which could result in
serious consequences for Yemen and the entire region.

Without a doubt, the current chaos in Yemen
is playing environment xclusively into the hands of
terrorist organizations. There is no alternative to a
political solution to the conflict in Yemen. We expect
dynamic activities from the United Nations with a view
to the resumption of peace talks between all parties
to the Yemeni conflict. That work, based on already
existing documents, should begin swiftly.
