The President: As we discuss the importance of
sustaining peace, we are appalled to hear that another
suicide attack has taken place today, this time in a
civilian-populated area in Kabul. I strongly condemn
the attack, which resulted in many deaths and injuries,
and we offer condolences to the victims and their
families as well as our support to the Government and
the people of Afghanistan.
