The President: There are no more names inscribed
on my list of speakers. I would like to commend
delegations for working throughout the lunch hour and
finishing at the perfect time of 6 pm.

However, several delegations have requested the
floor to make further statements. It is my intention to
accept those requests. I would ask delegations to be brief
and to limit themselves to one additional statement.

I now give the floor to the representative of Israel.
