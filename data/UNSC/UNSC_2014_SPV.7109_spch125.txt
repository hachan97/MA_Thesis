Mr. Imnadze (Georgia): The Chamber has
witnessed discussions about Georgia and Russia not
because of insinuations about Georgia, as was said,
but owing to the fact that 20 per cent of my country
is still under occupation. As for the cliches, let me say
that Georgia has been continuously demonstrating a
constructive approach and readiness for dialogue and
cooperation. Allow me to state that my Government has
established a special office under the Prime Minister of
Georgia for dialogue with Russia. We are constructively
involved in international talks in Geneva. Georgia has
unilaterally pledged not to use force. Last but not least,
the recent statement by the Georgian Prime Minister
on his readiness for dialogue and a meeting with the
Russian leadership and his Russian counterpart was,
for his part, in anticipation of the Russian President's
reciprocation. We look forward to positive and
constructive steps ahead and the ongoing dialogue
through the international Geneva talks, and possible
bilateral ones, resolving the current impasse.

Let me again stress the positive steps that Georgia
has taken in our readiness to continue along that same
path.
