Mr. Sergeyev (Ukraine): My country has been
mentioned once again. Ukraine has always presented
facts and figures, confirmed not only by other national
competent authorities, but also by many independent
observers and missions of international organizations
on the ground. Today, we also have a list of questions
on the 16 battalions and other groups. I urge the Council
to compare the figures. At the last Council meeting
(see S/PV.7365), 9,000 Russian troops were mentioned.
Today, we have calculated that there are around 12,000
troops, 235 tanks, 720 armoured combat vehicles and
263 artillery systems. It would be much easier for us
if we received any explanation from the Russian side
about what they are doing in the sovereign territory of
Ukraine. It would be much easier for all of us to solve
the problem if they immediately withdrew those forces
and their presence in Ukraine, pursuant to the Minsk
agreement.

What we have heard instead from the Russian
representative in the Council today is nothing but the old,
arid and constantly repeated magic mantra - fictions
about coup d'etats, Bandera and Shukhevych fascists,
anti-Semites, oppression of the Russian language,
ignoring the rights of the Donbas population, and so on.
But not even once have Ukraine and the world received
even a briefand meaningful message ofcondolence from
Russia for the victims killed by its own mercenaries in
Mariupol or Volnovakha. Instead, we see how Russia
helps the Russian-speaking population of Donbas: by
exterminating it with Grad shelling.

I call again on the Russian Federation not to
play with words or to turn Council deliberations into
theatre. We have a lot of proof of its direct and indirect
aggression in Ukraine. We are still restrained in calling
for the Council's full recognition that Russia is the
aggressor, but that cannot last long. Russia is a sponsor
of terrorism in Ukraine. We advise Russia to stop and
to do what was agreed in Minsk.
