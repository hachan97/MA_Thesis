The President: I would like to thank Mr. Vieira
de Mello for his comprehensive responses, congratulate
him on the tremendous stamina he has shown and also
thank him for the kinds remarks he has made about me
and my delegation.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

However, before adjourning the meeting, please
let me read a letter I have just received from the
Permanent Representative of India:

"Dear Kishore,

"I am writing to you in your capacity as
President of the Security Council. I understand
that at the open meeting of the Security Council
today on East Timor all speakers offered their
sympathies to my Government over the loss of
life in the earthquake in Gujarat. Since we were
not inscribed to speak, we were unable
immediately to convey our gratitude, but I wish
to convey to you, and through you to all the
members of the Security Council and to the other
representatives who spoke in the Council today,
our gratitude for the solidarity and the sympathy
that they had expressed in their statements.
Regards.

"Yours sincerely, Kamalesh Sharma"

The meeting rose at 7.20pm.
