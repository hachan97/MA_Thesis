Mr. Dolgov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We are grateful to the Permanent
Representative of Belgium, Mr. Grauls, for his briefing
on the work of the Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1737 (2006) during the past three months. In
that period, under the leadership of Mr. Grauls, the
Committee has worked in strict compliance with the
provisions of resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007) and
1803 (2008). It is our view that, in its future work, the
Committee will continue to be guided by the spirit and
letter of those resolutions in trying to achieve its main
purpose - the effective settlement of the Iranian
nuclear problem through exclusively political and
diplomatic means and through talks on the basis of
proposals by the six countries.

On that basis, we wish to comment on what we
heard in the briefing and in the statement of the
representative of the United States, Mr. Khalilzad, with
respect to the national implementation of paragraph 10
of resolution 1803 (2008). In that paragraph, the
Council calls on all States to exercise vigilance over
the activities of financial institutions in their territories
with all banks domiciled in Iran, in particular with
3
Bank Melli and Bank Saderat, and their branches and
subsidiaries abroad,

(4 
in order to avoid such activities
contributing to the proliferation sensitive nuclear
activities, or to the development of nuclear
weapons delivery systems."

We believe that this call is solely a reminder to
States to fulfil the relevant requirements of paragraph 6
of resolution 1737 (2006). Thus, the reference in
resolution 1803 (2008) to specific Iranian banks does
not impose new restrictions regarding financial ties
with the credit organizations of Iran. It was mentioned
solely to send Iran a further political message on the
need to comply with International Atomic Energy
Agency and Council requirements in order to settle the
Iranian nuclear issue.

States have the right to determine for themselves
how they will be vigilant in the context of paragraph
10 of resolution 1803 (2008). If some States require
guidance regarding implementation of that paragraph,
the optimal solution - and the only solution necessary,
as we see it - would be to refer to the 12 October
2007 guidelines of the Financial Action Task Force on
Money Laundering on implementation of the financial
provisions of resolution 1737 (2006). The Task Force's
guidelines, as we all know, are only recommendations.
