Mr. Gombo (Chad) (spoke in French): I would
like to thank Ambassador Oyarzun Marchesi, Chair of
the Security Council Committee established pursuant
to resolution 1737 (2006), for his quarterly briefing
on the Committee's activities from 15 September to
14 December.

With respect to the Iranian nuclear issue, we
welcome the entry into force, on 18 October, of the
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, 90 days after
the adoption of resolution 2231 (2015). We reiterate
that the Plan was a diplomatic and historic victory.
Accordingly, we call upon all the parties concerned
to conscientiously implement it and to overcome all
possible future obstacles through dialogue.

Moreover, beyond the Iranian nuclear issue, and
mindful of the ongoing conflicts and tensions in the
Middle East, the Security Council should accord
particular attention to the development of weapons of
mass destruction on the part of certain States in the
region and encourage the establishment of a zone free
of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East.

With regard to the activities of the 1737 Committee,
we commend it on its dynamic work and encourage
it to continue its efforts in the implementation of the
relevant Security Council resolutions. We take note of
its contribution and activities during 2015, its review
of the Committee's guidelines, in line with resolution
2231 (2015), and the mid-term report of the Panel of
Experts, which was transmitted to the Security Council
on 3 December.

In conclusion, we reiterate our full appreciation to
the Chair of the 1737 Committee and all the experts for
their commitment and dedication to the implementation
of their mandate.
