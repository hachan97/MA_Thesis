The President: Before concluding, I would like
to say that we all stand unified in our sympathy for
the people of Russia following the attack on Saint
Petersburg. We stand with the families and hope that
we can find those who perpetrated that heinous act. We
support them through that process.

We have all seen the reports of the terrible
chemical-weapon attack in Syria. In my capacity as
President, I would like to inform the Security Council
that the presidency intends to convene a meeting in
briefing format here, in open Chamber, tomorrow at
10 am. to discuss the attack. We will move our briefing
and consultations on Colombia to the afternoon so that
we can hold that emergency meeting. We hope to get as
much information on the Syrian attack as we can.

The meeting rose at11.55 a.m.
