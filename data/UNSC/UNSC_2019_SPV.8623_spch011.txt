Mr. De Riviere (France) (spoke in French): France
regrets that we did not reach an agreement today in
response to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Idlib.
We welcome the efforts of Germany, Belgium and
Kuwait to try to reach a balanced draft text that would
have merited our unanimous support.

While the situation in Idlib has continued to
deteriorate in recent months, I call on all of us to
demonstrate our responsibility and to work together
to find a compromise in the coming days. Those
who are directly involved have the responsibility to
ensure respect for international humanitarian law. The
situation in Idlib and, more generally, in Syria requires
that we have a constructive dialogue within this body.
It is in that spirit that France, for its part, remains ready
to work.
