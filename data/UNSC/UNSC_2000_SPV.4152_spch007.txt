Mr. Cunningham (United States of America): I
simply wanted to say that our work on, and support for,
this unanimous resolution results from my delegation's
concern for the difficult circumstances that the people
of Iraq find themselves in while the Iraqi Government
fails to comply with Security Council resolutions.

I would like to associate myself with the remarks
of Ambassador Greenstock, both in terms of the
resolution and with regard to activities of coalition
aircraft in the no-fly zones. And in that context I want
to add that it is disingenuous to suggest that the limited
military operations of our aircraft, in self-defence
against military targets that threaten them, somehow
impacts the overall humanitarian situation.
