Mr. Warraich (Pakistan): My delegation is
compelled to take the floor at this late hour in response
to the statement made by the representative of India
earlier today.

While there was nothing novel in the content of the
Indian assertions - which we will not dignify with
a response - what was remarkable was the setting
chosen to undertake this disingenuous attempt to
disencumber the United Nations of its central role in
the pacific settlement of disputes.

To pontificate from the altar of the Security
Council for the so-called integral part of India is
unfortunately yet another flight of fancy that the Indian
delegation has made a vocation of practising. It is
also a blatant disregard of multiple resolutions of the
Security Council that recognize Jammu and Kashmir
as a disputed territory, the final status of which is yet to
be determined in accordance with the resolutions of the
Security Council.

We wonder why a mere assertion of that fact has
caused the Indian delegation so much panic. Rightfully,
it is the anxiety of an occupying Power - an all too
familiar syndrome. Instead of blaming the storm on the
ship, India should recognize that the United Nations
is not ill-suited to undertake responsibility for the
peaceful settlement of disputes. It is in fact India's
continued occupation of Jammu and Kashmir that is
ill-suited to the purposes of maintaining peace and
stability in our region and the world.
