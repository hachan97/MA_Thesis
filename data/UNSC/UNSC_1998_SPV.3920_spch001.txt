The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received letters from the representatives of the
Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and the Netherlands, in which they
request to be invited to participate in the discussion of the
item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those two representatives to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Dorda (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) took a seat at the Council table;
Mr. Berteling (Netherlands) took the seat reserved for
him at the side of the Council Chamber.

The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them document
S/ 1998/795, which contains the text of a letter dated 24
August 1998 from the Acting Permanent Representatives of
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and the United States of America to the United Nations
addressed to the Secretary-General.

Members of the Council also have before them
document 5/1998/809, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of
America.

 
I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to documents S/1998/803 and S/1998/808,
letters dated 25 and 26 August 1998 respectively, from
the Charge d'affaires ad interim of the Permanent Mission
of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to the United Nations
addressed to the President of the Security Council.

The first speaker inscribed in my list is the
representative of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, to whom I
give the floor.
