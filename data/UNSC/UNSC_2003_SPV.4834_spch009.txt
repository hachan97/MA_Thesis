Mr. Cunningham (United States): I also wish to
thank Ambassador Kalomoh and Minister Ramos Horta
for their very informative presentations, providing us
the opportunity to discuss events in Guinea-Bissau. I
can be brief because my Government views things very
much in the terms that Ambassador Pleuger has already
set out.
We are watching developments in Guinea-Bissau
closely. We hope that the progress that is being made
towards the return of power to civilian leadership will
continue. I noted Ambassador Kalomoh's comments
about the consensus on the transition and the give-and-
take atmosphere that he described. We hope that that
would hold and provide a basis for going forward. We
encourage rapid steps to constitute a civilian
Government and to prepare for democratic elections
soon that would be open to broad-based participation.
We very much welcome and support the role the
Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) has played and is playing in support of this
process, as well as the roles of other members of the
international community. The Community of
Portuguese-Speaking Countries, the African Union and
the Security Council all share a common interest in
restoring civilian leadership and in improving
governance in Guinea-Bissau. We will continue to
monitor events in the country closely and coordinate
with ECOWAS, the African Union and others who are
helping, including members of this Council, and hope
that we can all see the restoration of the constitutional
order quickly.
