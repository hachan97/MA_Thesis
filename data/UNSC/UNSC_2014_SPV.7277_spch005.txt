Ms. Power (United States of America): I want to
thank members of the Council for their efforts to forge
a consensus that reaffirms to the people of Haiti today
that the members of the Security Council remain united
in their support for Haiti's aspirations to a secure and
stable country.

We agree with the Chilean Ambassador - and, I
assume, with everyone else on the Council - that the
situation on the ground should drive our decision-making
as a Council. It has up to this point, and it must continue
to do so going forward.

The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti
(MINUSTAH) will continue to make an important
contribution to Haiti's security. I would like to reiterate
the appreciation of the United Nations to the troops,
police and other staff who make up MINUSTAH in
order to support the Haitian people. Several of the troop-
and police-contributing countries are represented in the
Security Council, and others are here in the Chamber.
We thank them for all that they have done and will
continue to do.

We look forward to continuing to work
constructively together and with the Haitian people
to help them achieve durable peace, security and
democracy.
