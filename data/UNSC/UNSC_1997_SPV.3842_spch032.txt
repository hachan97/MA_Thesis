The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank
the representative of Norway for his kind words addressed
to me.
Several speakers inscribed on my list have not yet
taken the floor. In View of the lateness of the hour, with the
concurrence of members of the Council I will now suspend
the meeting. The meeting is suspended until tomorrow,
Friday, 19 December 1997, when it will resume at 10.30
am.

The meeting was suspended at 6 p.m.
