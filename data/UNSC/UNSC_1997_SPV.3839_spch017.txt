Mr. Eguignren (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish): Since its establishment more than five years
ago, the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force
(UNPREDEP) has played an important role in stabilizing
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the
Balkan region as a whole. We value enormously the
contribution that has been made by the Preventive
Deployment Force in the face of changing circumstances.

However, in spite of the apparent stability in the
region following the end of the recent crisis in Albania,
adverse factors still persist, at varying levels of intensity.
These make it inadvisable right now to bring to a close
this successful first experience of the United Nations in
preventive deployment.
Security Council 3839th meeting
Fifty-second year 4 December 1997

In this context, we should consider that, in spite of the
important progress made recently in relations between the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, no definitive agreement has yet
been reached on the delicate problem of the demarcation of
their common border. Furthermore, the persistence of
inter-ethnic tension and the possibility that potential
difficulties in the region will have repercussions in the
territory of Macedonia strengthen our conviction that the
level of stability necessary for considering ending
UNPREDEP has yet to be reached. Therefore, my
delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution by
which the Security Council would extend the mandate of
UNPREDEP for a period of nine months and would
request the Secretary-General to submit recommendations
on the type of international presence that could
subsequently be established in the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia.
