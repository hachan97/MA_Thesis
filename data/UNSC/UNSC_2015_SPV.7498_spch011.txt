Mr. Olguin Cigarroa (Chile) (spoke in Spanish):
Allow me to welcome your presence, Sir, and that of
all of the other Ministers who are here today. One year
after the tragedy, we reiterate our condolences to all of
the families affected.

My delegation would have liked the Council to
have sent a unified message to all of the families of
the victims of the tragic downing of Flight MH-l7.
Resolution 2166 (2014) was a major step forward in
clarifying the facts by establishing a Joint Investigation
Team, in parallel with the investigation conducted by
the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
But there is no doubt that accountability is part and
parcel of fundamental values that seek to see justice
done and prevent any form of impunity.

Chile is concerned About the effective application
of these principles. We have always been ready to
support any effort leading to a basic level of agreement
that would make it possible to continue to investigate
the facts and establish a jurisdictional mechanism
that would develop and complement resolution 2166
(2014). Beyond the legitimate legal interpretations, it
is essential for us that the exercise ofjurisdiction be as
expeditious as possible in response to the gravity of the
events and because of the undoubted need to provide
remedies to the families of the victims. To that end,
Chile supported draft resolution S/2015/562 because
justice and reparations constitute our world view and
sense of collective action.

In conclusion, we would like to end on a hopeful
note that the Council will be able to send the message
that the international community expects and hopes
for - because that reinforces our legitimacy regardless
of our reasonable differences.
