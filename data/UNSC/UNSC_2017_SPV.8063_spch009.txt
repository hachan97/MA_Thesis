Mr. Llorenty Soliz (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): The Plurinational State of Bolivia
welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 2381
(2017), authorizing the United Nations Verification
Mission in Colombia to begin the tasks assigned to
the monitoring and verification mechanism, which
will primarily verify the achievement of the historic
bilateral, temporary national ceasefire agreement
between the Government of Colombia and the Ejercito
de Liberacion Nacional.

We thank the United Kingdom for its work and the
way it conducted negotiations on the resolution. We are
also grateful to all members of the Security Council
for their support to this process and their commitment
to resolving the last armed conflict in our region. We
praise the leadership of the Government of Colombia
and the decisiveness of the Ejercito de Liberacion
Nacional in establishing the first bilateral ceasefire in
this conflict, which is the result of recent progress in
Colombia's peace process.

Similarly, I thank all Council members for
committing to and supporting a process to resolve
the longest-running armed conflict in my region. We
commend the Government of Colombia on its leadership
and the Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional on its decision
to broker the first bilateral ceasefire in the conflict.
We believe that it is the result of the recent progress
Colombia has made in the peace process.

We trust that both parties have taken the necessary
steps to make the process irreversible. Although
we acknowledge the differences between this peace
process and the process with the Fuerzas Armadas
Revolucionarias de Colombia - Ejercito del Pueblo, we
have no doubt that the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General, Mr. Jean Arnault, and his entire
team will continue to work just as hard as they have
been working since they embarked on the path in 2016.
