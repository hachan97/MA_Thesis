The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, New
Zealand and Norway, in which they request to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Ms. Wensley
(Australia), Mr. Fonseca (Brazil), Mr. Wibisono
(Indonesia), Mr. Powles (New Zealand) and Mr.
Brattskar (Norway) took the seats reserved for
them at the side of the Council Chamber.

The President: In the absence of objection, I
shall take it that the Security Council agrees to extend
an invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Hedi Annabi, Assistant Secretary-
General for Peacekeeping Operations.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Annabi to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

At the outset, I should like on behalf of the
Council to express profound condolences to the
Governments and the peoples of Bangladesh and of
Nepal, as well as to the bereaved families, in
connection with the deaths of two of their soldiers, who
gave their lives in the cause of peace while serving
with the United Nations Transitional Administration in
East Timor.

I give the floor to the Assistant Secretary-General
for Peacekeeping Operations, Mr. Hedi Annabi, to
whom the Council has extended an invitation under
rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure.
