Mr. Li Junhua (China) (spoke in Chinese): At
the outset, I wish to thank the High Representative,
Lord Ashdown, for his comprehensive and complete
briefing. We greatly appreciate the efforts he has made
as the High Representative for the Implementation of
the Peace Agreement on Bosnia and Herzegovina.

We are pleased to note that since the second half
of last year, Bosnia and Herzegovina has made positive
efforts and has achieved remarkable results in
strengthening institution-building, achieving economic
recovery, completing its judicial system and police
reform, and facilitating national reconciliation. We
greatly appreciate the fact that the Office of the High
Representative has played a positive role in that regard.

The European Union military mission in Bosnia
and Herzegovina (EUFOR) smoothly took over
responsibilities from the Stabilization Force (SFOR)
and demonstrated its capabilities in supporting the
political process in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We
welcome the further contributions made by the
European Union (EU) in the political process and in
helping maintain the stability of the country.

In the 10 years since the signing of the Dayton
Peace Agreement, through the efforts by Bosnia and
Herzegovina and the parties involved and with the
assistance of the international community, the country
has made encouraging progress in various aspects of
national reconstruction. The parties involved should
greatly value that hard-won achievement. We hope that
the country and the parties involved will further
strengthen their mutual trust and unity in order to
gradually lead the country's people of various ethnic
minorities to peaceful coexistence and shared
development.

We hope that Lord Ashdown will bring even
better news to his next meeting with the Council, and
China will continue its efforts in that regard.
