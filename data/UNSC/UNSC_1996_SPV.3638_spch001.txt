The President: I should like to inform the members
of the Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, Haiti and
Venezuela, in which they request to be invited to participate
in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives to
participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Lelong (Haiti)
took a seat at the Council table; Mr. Cardenas
(Argentina), Mr. Rahman (Bangladesh), Mr.
Fowler (Canada) and Mr. Tejera-Pari's (Venezuela)
took the seats reserved for them at the side of the
Council Chamber.

The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Mission in
Haiti, document S/l996/112.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/l996/l36, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by Argentina, Canada, Chile, France,
Honduras, the United States of America and Venezuela.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to document S/ 1996/99, which contains the text
of a letter dated 13 February 1996 from the Secretary-
General addressed to the President of the Security Council,
transmitting the text of a letter dated 9 February 1996 from
the President of Haiti addressed to the Secretary-General.

The first speaker is the representative of Haiti, on
whom I now call.
