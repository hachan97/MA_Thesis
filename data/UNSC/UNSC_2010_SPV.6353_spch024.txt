The President: I shall now make a statement in
my capacity as the representative of Nigeria.

I would like join those who have already
welcomed His Excellency President Boris Tadic' and
thanked him for his statement to the Council. I also
thank Mr. Lamberto Zannier, Mr. De Kermabon and
Mr. Hyseni for their briefings.
The recent incident in Mitrovica that resulted in
loss of life and several injuries was indeed regrettable.
We urge all parties to act with restraint and to avoid
provocative actions or pronouncements that may
trigger further violence.

There is a need to sustain efforts at building
confidence among communities. In that context, we
call on all parties to engage assiduously in promoting
reconciliation and a peaceful settlement of pending
issues through the time-tested principles of
compromise and mutual respect.

We reiterate that issues related to northern
Kosovo and Kosovo in general should be addressed
through peaceful means and close cooperation and
coordination between all actors. In that regard, we urge
all countries of the region, relevant stakeholders and
the international community to commit to efforts
towards the peaceful settlement of the Kosovo issue.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

The President of the Republic of Serbia has asked
for the floor to make a further statement. I give him the
floor.
