Mr. Andjaba (Namibia): We, too, would like to
thank Assistant Secretary-General Annabi for his
comprehensive briefing on the situation in Kosovo.

My delegation wishes to express its support for
the men and women of the United Nations Interim
Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Kosovo
Force (KFOR) for their dedication and good work,
sometimes performed in very difficult circumstances.

We also note with appreciation the partnership for
security being forged between UNMIK and KFOR on
the one hand and various communities in Kosovo on
the other. As for the election, we note the progress
made with regard to the election registration process,
and we hope that the contacts between the authorities
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and UNMIK will
facilitate and encourage the participation of all the
communities. In this regard, we wish to stress that all
efforts must be brought to bear to make it clear,
especially to the communities of the Serbs and Turks
who decided not to participate, that it is in their best
interests to participate in free and fair elections for a
multi-democratic Kosovo.

We would also like to acknowledge the institution
of the office of Ombudsperson, which has been
established to see to it that all minorities and other
communities have a say in Kosovo.
