Sir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): We are
very grateful to Mr. Annabi for his briefing and for all
the hard work that the Department of Peacekeeping

 

Operations is doing to get the United Nations Mission in
Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) in on the ground.

At this point, I only want to ask a couple of questions
about UNAMSIL's ability to deploy. First, as regards the
logistical effort that needs to be upgraded, I wanted to ask
whether there were still shortfalls or whether the gap has
been filled with civilian contractors. And is it logistics that
is affecting the ability to deploy UNAMSIL outside
Freetown at an early date, or are we going deeper into the
business of the capacity of UNAMSIL's contingents at this
moment to go beyond a very restricted area of operations?
Thirdly, could Mr. Annabi let us know which countries so
far have agreed to contribute troops to the enlarged
UNAMSIL and whether he can give us a clearer idea of the
time frames that he is envisaging for full deployment?
I will stop here. I will make other comments when
we come to our second meeting.
