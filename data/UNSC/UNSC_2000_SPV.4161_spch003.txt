The President (spoke in French): I thank Judge
Jorda for a briefing that was eloquent and characterized
by great vision and clarity. He gave us specific
proposals on how to improve the functioning of a
Tribunal that our Council created in 1993. This
Tribunal is an essential element of the return to peace
in the former Yugoslavia, because we all know that
there can be no peace without justice. The Tribunal,
however, also represents considerable progress in
international law and the universal conscience. Hence,
the important of today's debate. The smooth
functioning and effectiveness of the Tribunal are of
concern to us. What we have to say will help it fulfil
the important task that we entrusted to it.

I now call on members of the Council.
