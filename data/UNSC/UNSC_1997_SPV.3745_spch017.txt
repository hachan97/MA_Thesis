Mr. Mahugu (Kenya): Over the last three years we
have been encouraged by the progress made in the peace
process in the Middle East. Kenya has been an advocate of
peace in that part of the world and has supported the
dialogue that has been evident between the parties.

We are concerned about any threats to the ongoing
negotiations. We believe that these negotiations have
proved to be fruitful so far, and we therefore call upon the
parties concerned to refrain from any activities that may
have the potential to undermine the peace process.

It is in that regard that we urge the parties in the
Middle East to exercise restraint at this stage and to
continue to negotiate on all the outstanding issues, including
the permanent status of Jerusalem.

On our part, we are determined to continue to support
the parties in their search for a durable, comprehensive, just
and permanent peace. The people of the region -- both
Palestinians and Israelis .._. and the world at large want
peace.
