The President (spoke in Arabic): There are no
more names on the list of speakers.

Before adjourning the meeting, I would like to
express the sincere appreciation of the delegation of
Jordan to the members of the Council, especially my
colleagues the Permanent Representatives and their
respective staff, and to the Secretariat for all of the
support they have given us. Indeed, it has been a very
busy month, and it is not over yet. However, we have
reached consensus on several important issues within
our purview. We could not have done it without the
hard work, support and positive contributions of every
delegation, representatives of the Secretariat and all
relevant Conference Services staff. As we end our
presidency, on behalf of the Council, I would like to
wish the delegation of Lithuania success in the month
of May.

The meeting rose at 10.55 a.m.
