Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I thank you,
Madam President, for convening this meeting, which
we appreciate very much. It was very good to hear
from the Special Envoy. We appreciate the efforts he
has made. We share his disappointment at the fact that
the talks did not go ahead as planned, but it was good
to hear that the consultations he did manage to hold
yielded some positive outcomes. I think among those
was the inclusivity point that Mr. Griffiths mentioned,
particularly on the presence of women, which I think is
excellent. But I urge all sides, including the Houthis, to
get behind the process that the Special Envoy is leading,
invest in confidence-building measures and engage in
future consultations in good faith. That is bound to
require flexibility from all sides, but we all know, and
we have said many times, that there is no alternative to
a political solution.

We support Mr. Griffiths and we would like to
continue to support him to the hilt. We can offer
Security Council members some press elements, if
that would be welcome, as a way of expressing that the
Council stands behind him at this time as he tries to
bring all the parties back together. I think that what
he said about the economy of Yemen just gives added
urgency to an already desperate situation. I therefore
hope we can all build on that.
