Mr. Nishida (Japan): At the outset, I would like
to express Japan's sincere appreciation for the
tremendous efforts by Austria, in its capacity as Chair
of the Informal Working Group on International
Tribunals, which have crystallized into the resolution
we have just adopted on the residual mechanism.

The establishment of the International Criminal
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was the
manifestation of the full determination of the
international community not to tolerate impunity. The
Tribunals have contributed significantly to the
furtherance of international criminal justice.

Today, we, the members of the Security Council,
have decided to establish the residual mechanism, the
extremely important organ that will take over essential
functions and maintain the legacies of the Tribunals.
Bearing in mind the lofty mission of the mechanism,
Japan will cooperate in the implementation of this
resolution to the best of its ability, in accordance with
the spirit of internationally established principles on
criminal matters and within the framework of our
Constitution.

Finally, we would like to call upon the Tribunals to
complete their work expeditiously. We also call on all
States and organizations concerned to continue their
cooperation for the realization of a smooth transition to
the mechanism, so that we may continue to move
forward without any delay in our fight against impunity.
