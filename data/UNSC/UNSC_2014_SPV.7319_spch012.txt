Mr. Cherif (Chad) (spoke in French): I thank
Ambassador Oh J oon of the Republic of Korea, Chair of
the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1540
(2004) on the non-proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, for his briefing and congratulate him for
his leadership at the head of the Committee for the past
two years. I also thank the expert group of the 1540
Committee for its remarkable work.

Chad welcomes the 1540 Committee's achievements,
in particular the holding of three special meetings in
Africa for countries that have not yet submitted their
first report, and the organization of 59 awareness-
raising activities around the world. Further, Chad
wishes to thank the 1540 Committee and the United
Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs for having
facilitated the participation of two of those experts at
the regional conference on the full implementation of
resolution 1540 (2004), organized in Seoul in October.

Chad reiterates its commitment to working towards
the implementation of resolution 1540 (2004) and calls
for heightened dialogue between the 1540 Committee
and the 20 States Members that have not yet submitted
their reports. In that regard, we ask the Committee to
focus more on those States, 16 of which are in Africa,
through awareness-raising activities and visits to the
countries concerned. Chad fully supports the activities
of the 1540 Committee and eagerly awaits the general
review of the full implementation of resolution 1540
(2004) requested by the Security Council in resolution
1977 (2011).

In conclusion, I would like to reiterate our
congratulations to Ambassador Oh Joon and his entire
team for the excellent work accomplished under the
Korean chairmanship.
