Mr. Oh Joon (Republic of Korea): I would like to
thank Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman for
his briefing. We take this opportunity to reiterate our
full support for the Secretary-General's good offices,
including Mr. Feltman's recent visit to Ukraine.

The Republic of Korea is closely monitoring
the events in eastern Ukraine, and we are deeply
concerned about the continuing escalation of tensions.
We had hoped that the Minsk meeting between the
two Presidents would be a turning point in finding a
diplomatic solution to the crisis. But, on the contrary,
the situation on the ground has further deteriorated.
In particular, we are alarmed that the separatist armed
groups have pushed their way into the southern city
of Novoazovsk, opening a dangerous new front in the
ongoing crisis.

We are also seriously concerned about the report
that indicates the involvement of Russian troops in the
latest round offighting inside Ukraine. We hope that it is
not true. We hope that Russia's explanation is true, that
there are no Russian troops inside Ukraine. Otherwise,
that would constitute a gross violation of Ukraine's
sovereignty and territorial integrity and would bring
the crisis into a new dimension. We strongly oppose
any outside military intervention in the situation in
Ukraine.

In the light of the volatile situation, we stress that
a genuine solution to the crisis can be found only with
an immediate cessation of hostilities through dialogue
between all the parties concerned. In that regard, we
hope that President Poroshenko's plan for a road map
towards a ceasefire with the armed groups can offer a
sound basis for the de-escalation of tensions.

The stability and prosperity of Ukraine are critical
not only to peace in Europe but also far beyond it. We
once again reaffirm our full support for Ukraine's
sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.
