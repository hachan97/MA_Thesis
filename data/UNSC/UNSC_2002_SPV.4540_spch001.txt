The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

In a letter dated 20 May 2002 addressed to the
Secretary-General, the President and the Prime
Minister of the Democratic Republic of East Timor
submitted the application of their country for
membership in the United Nations. Their letter has
been circulated in document S/2002/558.

Under the provisions of rule 59 of the provisional
rules of procedure of the Security Council, unless the
Council decides otherwise, an application for
membership shall be referred by the President of the
Council to the Committee on the Admission of New
Members. Accordingly, unless I hear a proposal to the
contrary, I shall refer the application of the Democratic
Republic of East Timor to the Committee on the
Admission of New Members for examination and
report.

As I hear no objection, it is so decided.

I propose that the Committee on the Admission of
New Members meet tomorrow at 10 a.m., in
Conference Room 7, to consider the application of the
Democratic Republic of East Timor for membership in
the United Nations.

The meeting rose at 9.40 p.m.
