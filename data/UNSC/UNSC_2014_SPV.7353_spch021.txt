Mr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We opposed the initiative to hold this
meeting. We believe that it could well have negative
consequences in terms of maintaining the effectiveness
of the work of the Security Council and other United
Nations bodies.

The Council is often criticized for the fact that it
is increasingly involved in matters that do not pertain
to its mandate. Today, we have provided yet another
reason for such criticism. Human rights issues should
be addressed not here but in the Human Rights Council,
a body that was created, with the active participation
of many members of the Security Council, specifically
to debate such issues and endowed with the necessary
powers and expertise to that end.

Finally, and needless to say, today's discussion is
unlikely to promote international dialogue with the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea on this subject,

in which its authorities have expressed their readiness
to engage.
