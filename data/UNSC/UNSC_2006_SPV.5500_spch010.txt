The President (spoke in French): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as representative of
France.
Resolution 1696 (2006), which the Security
Council has just adopted, was made necessary by the
fact that Iran, despite three meetings between
Mr. Javier Solana and Mr. Ali Larijani, has shown no

willingness to seriously discuss the substance of the
proposals made on 6 June on behalf of China, France,
Germany, the Russian Federation, the Russian
Federation and the United States. Under such
conditions, the six countries had no choice but to
resume the activity that had been suspended in the
Security Council. We welcome the international
community's support, through this vote, for the efforts
of our countries.

France - in a position shared by Germany,
which co-sponsored the text - emphasizes the
following elements.

The resolution that we have just adopted makes
mandatory the suspension requested by the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA); it does
not mean an end to negotiations. We reaffirm the
proposals made to Iran on 6 June by our six countries.
If Iran should refuse to comply with the resolution, we
will then work to adopt measures under Article 41 of
Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. If
Iran should implement the decisions of the IAEA and
the Security Council and enter into negotiations, we
will be prepared to abstain from further action in the
Council.

Once again, we appeal to Iran to respond
positively to the substantive proposals that we made
last month.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

I give the floor to the representative of the
Islamic Republic of Iran.
