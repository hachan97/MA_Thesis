Mr. Ndong Mba (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in Spanish): I am taking the floor following the voting on
the two draft resolutions (S/2018/l75 and S/2018/321)
above all to express our frustration over the fact that
the Security Council was not able to adopt either the
first or the second draft, which sought to give the
Council an independent and professional mechanism
with a mandate to attribute responsibility for the use
of chemical weapons, despite the fact that all Security
Council members expressed their desire in that regard.
That is precisely why we voted in favour of both draft
resolutions in the hope of having a new monitoring
mechanism to attribute responsibility so as to protect
people from the terrible and harmful effects of such
chemical weapons.

Despite the negative outcome of the voting on
both draft resolutions, the Government of the Republic
of Equatorial Guinea, whose position on the use of
chemical weapons we have clearly set out during the
debates on the issue, wants the members of the Security
Council to seek and to explore other alternative
draft texts that could merit the joint agreement or
the consensus of the Security Council so that we can
establish that new mechanism as soon as possible. That
is what the people who are suffering, or in the future
may suffer, the terrible effects of chemical weapons
hope and expect of the Security Council.
