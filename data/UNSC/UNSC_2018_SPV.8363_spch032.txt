President Moon Jae-in and Chairman Kim on their visit
to Mount Paekdu. As the highest point on the Korean
peninsula, that mountain bears a very special meaning
for all Koreans. The microclimate of Mount Paekdu
makes the weather very unpredictable - sunny and
clear one moment, but foggy and drizzly the next. We
were there in stunningly clear sunny and clear weather.
But that was probably the exception rather than the
norm. Our path to the complete denuclearization and
the establishment of a permanent peace on the Korean
peninsula might prove likewise - uneasy periods of
uncertainty and weariness interspersed with moments
of a step change in progress and clear visibility towards
our goal.

But, in the longer scheme of things, comparing
where we were a year ago and where we are today, the
situation has definitively become clearer and visibility
has been greatly enhanced. The change has been
possible because of bold, far-sighted and determined
leadership, much of which has rested on you, Secretary
Pompeo, and the unity of the international community.
As long as we stay this course, I am confident that the
months ahead will take us even closer to our shared
goal of realizing a nuclear-free Korean peninsula that is
permanently at peace.
