The President: I thank the representative of
Germany for his kind words addressed to me.

 

I should have begun by apologizing, on behalf of the
Council, for keeping this impressive list of speakers waiting
for 45 minutes as we dealt with important procedural
issues. I do so now: I apologize for keeping them waiting.

I should like to inform the Council that I have just
received letters from the representatives of Iraq and Israel
in which they request to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives to
participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Hasan (Iraq)
and Mr. Gold (Israel) took the seats reserved for them
at the side of the Council Chamber.
