Mr. Pujalte (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): Like
other delegations, my delegation thanks the Under-
Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations,
Mr. Guehenno, and the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Vieira de Mello,
for their briefings today.

The Mexican delegation profoundly regrets the
confirmation that members of the Mouvement de
liberation congolais (MLC) have committed war crimes
and violations of human rights in eastern Democratic
Republic of the Congo. Particularly disturbing are the
reports of kidnappings, the rape of women and
children, summary executions and acts of cannibalism.

In order to help improve the human rights
situation, the Pretoria Peace Agreement for the
establishment of a transitional Government must be
implemented. As well, the commitments undertaken by
the parties involved in the conflict must be fulfilled,
especially, as Mr. Vieira de Mello indicated, the
establishment of a national observatory for human
rights and of a truth and reconciliation commission that
could gather testimony from those persons who have
been affected so that justice can be done and the guilty
brought to justice.

The Security Council must demand that the
parties to the conflict respect human rights and punish
the guilty. In that regard, we also support sending a
fact-finding commission to help determine where the
responsibilities lie.

Finally, we call on Mr. Jean-Pierre Bemba, the
leader of the MLC, to take the necessary measures to
make compensation for the damages done by members
of his group and to bring to justice those guilty of those
crimes. For that purpose, there is a need for objective,
impartial tribunals in which the international
community has confidence.
