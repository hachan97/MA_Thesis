The President: I thank the representative of the
Syrian Arab Republic for the kind words he addressed
to the Chair.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. In accordance with the understanding reached in
the Council's prior consultations, I should now like to
invite Council members to informal consultations to
continue our discussion on the subject.
