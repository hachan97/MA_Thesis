Mr. van Walsum (Netherlands): My delegation
feels that the draft resolution on which we are about to
vote does not adequately reflect the continued
commitment to the settlement plan which during the
Council's consultations was expressed by a large
number of delegations, including my own.

It is true that in the fifth preambular paragraph
the Council reiterates its full support for the continued
efforts to implement the settlement plan, but the abrupt
addition by which it subsequently notes that
fundamental differences remain to be resolved
produces a somewhat disingenuous overtone which
does not do justice to the importance that the Council
has claimed to attach to the settlement plan for many
years. If we are nevertheless prepared to vote for the
draft resolution it is because we do not want to block
any avenue the Secretary-General's Personal Envoy
may wish to follow in the discharge of his mandate to
explore ways and means to achieve an early, durable
and agreed resolution to the dispute over Western
Sahara.
