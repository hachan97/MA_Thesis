The President: I will come back to the
representative of Chad later. Because he has spoken
about the importance of having a strong African voice
on the Council, I would like to let him know that his
voice was very loud, very strong and always a voice
for dignity, and that voice will be missed. We therefore
hope to hear from him going forward.
