Mr. Ould Abdallah: Thank you, Sir, for
presiding over this meeting and for giving me the
opportunity to speak once again. First of all, I
appreciate your kind words and those of Council
members addressed to me, my colleagues, my Office
and the Secretary-General.

Secondly, I note with great appreciation the
Council's renewed and practical interest in the
situation in Somalia and in the progress made, which
needs to be consolidated. We need to continue to
support this Government, whatever difficulties it may
have within the country. Without a Government there
will be no progress.

Thirdly, I would note in particular positive
support for the increased integration of the United
Nations system in order to help it to be better informed
and more effective in delivering its various forms of
assistance. I also note with appreciation the
encouragement for the idea that the international
community has to move back to Mogadishu to be
closer to the victims and to be more effective. We
cannot continue to address Somalia by remote control.

Fourthly, the vast support for the Istanbul
Conference on Somalia is most encouraging and will
strengthen the Government of President Sheikh Sharif
Sheikh Ahmed and his peace efforts with all Somalis
ready to talk stability and to set aside their arms.

Finally, I call on all parties engaged in the
process to help the timely and effective disbursement
of stipends to members of parliament and to soldiers.
Lack of payment is at the root of much of the crisis that
the Government is living through. Regular payment or
the lack thereof has a critical impact on stability within
Somalia.
