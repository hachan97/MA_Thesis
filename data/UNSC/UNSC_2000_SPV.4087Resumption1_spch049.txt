The President: I would ask all representatives in the
room whose Permanent Representatives are not here any
more to inform them of the six undertakings that we have
just heard from the head of the Joint United Nations
Programme on HIV/AIDS. I would ask the Assistant
Secretary-General to bring them to the attention of the
Secretary-General and other people.

I hope this means the beginning of a deepened and
greater collaboration between elements within the United
Nations family. I commend Dr. Piot for his involvement
today and I hope that we will be seeing him again in the
Security Council in the future. The same, of course, goes
for Mark Malloch Brown.

The next speaker is the representative of Cuba. I
invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make
his statement.
