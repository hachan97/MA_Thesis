The President: Under the item on its agenda, the
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
report of the Committee on the Admission of New
Members concerning the application of the Republic of
Nauru for admission to membership in the United Nations,
which appears in document S/1999/716.

In paragraph 3 of the report, the Committee
recommends to the Council that it should have recourse to
the provision of the last paragraph of rule 60 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure in order to present
its recommendation to the General Assembly at its
fifty-third session. If I hear no objection, I shall take it that
the Council Wishes to waive the time limits set forth in the
penultimate paragraph of rule 60.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

In paragraph 4 of the report, the Committee
recommends to the Security Council the adoption of a draft
resolution on the application of the Republic of Nauru for
admission to membership in the United Nations.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution contained in
paragraph 4 of the report of the Committee on the
Admission of New Members (S/l999/716). Unless I hear
any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council who
wish to make statements before the voting.
