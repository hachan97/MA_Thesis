The President (spoke in French): I thank the
Permanent Representative of Croatia for the kind
words he addressed to me. I believe it is a very fine
symbol that the last speaker in this important debate
should be the representative of a country that has
witnessed particularly encouraging developments.

By way of conclusion to our discussion, I wish to
give the floor to Mr. Carl Bildt to draw conclusions and
respond to the comments and questions addressed to
him.
