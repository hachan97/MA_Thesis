Mr. Taula (New Zealand): New Zealand strongly
supports the work of the United Nations Mission in
South Sudan (UNMISS) and we are pleased that the
Council was able to reach consensus on the Mission's
new mandate. That said, we would have preferred
a fuller discussion in order to work through the
contentious issues, and we hope that sufficient time will
be provided for such a discussion at the next renewal.

The Council should continue to closely monitor
the suitability of the UNMISS mandate in the light
of developing circumstances on the ground. It will be
important for the incoming Special Representative of
the Secretary-General to make his own assessment
of the needs of the Mission with fresh eyes and to
bring that assessment to the Council early next year.
It will also be important for the work of the task force
headed by Assistant Secretary-General Wane on the
independent special investigation to be mainstreamed
into the future mandate. In the meantime, we support
the Secretary-General's message from his strategic
assessment of UNMISS that the Mission needs to focus
on its most pressing tasks, particularly the protection of
civilians and support to the political process.

As a final point and as this may be our last
public statement on a peacekeeping mission before
our term ends, I wish to briefly note New Zealand's
efforts to provide new, more meaningful Security
Council engagement with troop-contributing countries
(TCCs) and other key stakeholders through informal
triangular consultations. We encourage Council
members to continue those efforts to engage TCCs
more productively. We also owe it to our peacekeepers
and the people they are mandated to protect to ensure
that they are more consistently provided with clear and
realistic mandates, as well as the resources, equipment
and support to carry them out.
