Mr. De La Sabliere (France) (spoke in French):
France welcomes the adoption of resolution 1757
(2007) which, in response to the request of the
Government of Lebanon, will enter into force on
10 June 2007, unless an internal solution is found
before then with respect to the provisions of the
Agreement on the establishment of a Special Tribunal
for Lebanon.

This is an important decision for several reasons.
The first is justice, as it opens the way to the trial of
those guilty of the attack that took the life of former
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on 14 February
2005 and other terrorist attacks committed in Lebanon
since October 2004. It establishes essential continuity
with the International Independent Investigation
Commission.

It is also important for peace in Lebanon. Justice
cannot stand in the way of stability. The rejection of
impunity, shared by all Lebanese, is an essential
guarantee of peace.

It is, finally, an important decision for the
credibility of the United Nations - and of the Security
Council in particular, whose commitment to finding the
truth in Lebanon has been unflagging.

The Council can take pride today in not having
resigned itself to the ongoing impasse of which the
Lebanese Government and the Secretary-General and
his Legal Counsel had on several occasions informed
it. The Council can be proud that it has shouldered its
responsibility by helping Lebanon to overcome the
obstacles that it was facing and to proceed along the
path to recovering its independence and its sovereignty.
