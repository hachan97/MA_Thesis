Belgium abstained in the voting on draft resolution S/2020/797, on non- proliferation, alongside our European partners who are members of the Security Council - France, Germany and the United Kingdom (E-3) - and Estonia. Belgium is concerned about the potentially negative impact that the expiration of the conventional arms embargo against Iran might have on the security situation in the region. These concerns must be addressed. Belgium remains committed to the full implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA). It is our main priority to preserve that agreement, including through the tools and procedures it provides. We support the efforts of the E-3 and the European Union to address concerns regarding Iran's nuclear programme within the framework of the dispute resolution mechanism. Belgium is of the view that the text proposed could have jeopardized broader ongoing efforts to preserve the JCPOA and entailed even greater security risks while undermining the credibility of the Security Council. These are not the terms on which Belgium would like to engage and discuss security challenges in the region. We look forward to engaging on an initiative that accommodates the preservation of the JCPOA and its achievements. Belgium regrets the deterioration of the current context, which negatively affects compliance with resolution 2231 (2015) and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Now more than ever, diplomacy needs to prevail. We call on all actors involved to refrain from any actions that could further exacerbate tensions. As facilitator of the 2231 process, I would also like to recall paragraph 2 of resolution 2231 (2015), which "Tc]alls upon all Member States, regional organizations and international organizations to take such actions as may be appropriate to support the implementation of the JCPOA, including by [...] refraining from actions that undermine implementation of commitments under the JCPOA".
