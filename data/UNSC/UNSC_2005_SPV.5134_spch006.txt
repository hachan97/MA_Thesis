Mr. Fendrick (United States of America): Thank
you, Mr. Foreign Minister, for speaking to us today,
clearly outlining the unique capabilities of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE), which have made it so effective in securing
peace and security. In your comments, you made a
point also raised by the Secretary-General's High-level
Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change: that the
United Nations should cooperate more often and better
with regional organizations. You highlighted early
warning, early action and conflict prevention as an area
for further cooperation. To follow Ambassasor Motoc
with basically the same question, how, in practical
terms, do you think the two organizations can improve
their cooperation in order to proactively prevent and
respond to threats?

The second question we would ask concerns the
following. You mentioned the success of the OSCE
election teams sent to Afghanistan and to the
Palestinian Authority and said that the OSCE could
develop its relations beyond the OSCE region even
further. What opportunities do you see for the OSCE
and its expertise outside of the OSCE region?
