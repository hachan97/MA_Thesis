Mr. Cherif (Chad) (spoke in French): Chad is
deeply concerned by the serious turn of the situation in
Ukraine despite the many appeals of the international
community for a de-escalation, calm and dialogue. Chad
believes that any conflict between States Members of
the United Nations should find a peaceful solution
within the framework United Nations Charter and in
accordance with the principles of sovereignty, non-use
of force and peaceful settlement of disputes.

Given the deteriorating situation in Ukraine, Chad
reiterates its appeal for restraint and calm and calls upon
the international community to undertake a mediation
in order to bring about a dialogue between the parties.
In that regard, Chad supports all mediation efforts of the
international community seeking to bring the parties
concerned to settle their differences in accordance with
the Charter of the United Nations and respect for the
commitments under the various agreements.
