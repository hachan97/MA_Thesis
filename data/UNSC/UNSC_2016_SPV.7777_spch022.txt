Mr. De Mistura: I wish to respond to one specific
question, which was very precise and clearly raised by
the Ambassador of the Russian Federation.

First, I would like to reply that I am guided by
the Geneva communique (S/2012/522, annex) and by
resolution 2254 (2015), both with regard to the agenda
and the invitations. I have in the past - and this is
my reply - witnessed refusals for active direct talks
from the High Negotiations Committee, which set
preconditions. I asked the Ambassador of Syria, who
was also the representative ofthe Syrian Government in
Geneva, whether the Syrian delegation wanted to have
at that time direct talks with the delegations that were
present at the times. The Ambassador of Syria - I ask
him to correct me ifI am wrong - indicated that he did
not want to discuss with terrorists or representatives
of terrorists or participants in terrorism. I can confirm
that I will send the invitations. Obviously, the political
process cannot be held hostage by the security
environment.

At the same time, let me recall what was stated
in that regard. On that special day - I consider
9 September a special day, or evening rather - there
was a long and very detailed discussion between the
Russian Federation and the United States. At that time,
I made a statement on behalf of the United Nations in
which I said the following:

"The United Nations hopes that the implementation
of this understanding will facilitate without
preconditions renewed efforts to reach a Syrian-
owned and Syrian-led political settlement of the
conflict, as called for by the Geneva communique
and by resolution 2254 (2015). I will then proceed
to consult with the Secretary-General and the
International Syria Support Group in order to be
able to launch it."

That is still my hope. I can therefore confirm that
when I send the invitations, as per resolution 2254
(2015), I will do that for direct talks.
