The President: In accordance with rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite the
representative of Libya to participate in this meeting.

In accordance with rule 39 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure, I invite Mr. Ghassan
Salame, Special Representative of the Secretary-
General and Head of the United Nations Support
Mission in Libya, to participate in this meeting.

Mr. Salame is joining today's meeting via video-
teleconference from Tripoli.

The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2018/140, which contains the report of
the Secretary-General on the United Nations Support
Mission in Libya.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear
briefings by Mr. Salame and Ambassador Carl Orrenius
Skau, Charge d'affaires ad interim of Sweden, on
behalf of the Chair of the Security Council Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1970 (2011)
concerning Libya.

Recalling the Security Council's latest note 507 on
its working methods (S/2017/507), I wish to encourage
all participants, both members and non-members of the
Council, to deliver their statements in five minutes or
less. Note 507 also encourages briefers to be succinct and
to focus on key issues. Briefers are further encouraged
to limit initial remarks to 15 minutes or less.

I now give the floor to Mr. Salame'.
