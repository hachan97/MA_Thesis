Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara (MINURSO) has diligently implemented its
mandate from the Security Council in contributing
to the efforts to find a political solution to the issue
of Western Sahara and maintain overall stability in
the region. China commends the efforts ofMINURSO's
peacekeepers and supports the renewal of its mandate.

Resolution 2494 (2019), which the Council has
just adopted, renews the MINURSO mandate for 12
months. It demonstrates the Council's determination to
uphold the Mission's mandate and promote a political
settlement of the question of Western Sahara. China
hopes that in future the consultations in the Council on
draft resolutions renewing MINURSO's mandate will
be more adequate to arriving at a more balanced text
and reaching consensus.

China appreciates the efforts of Mr. Kohler, the
Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Western
Sahara, in using his good offices on the issue, and
hopes that a new Personal Envoy will be appointed
without delay so that the round-table meetings can
resume as soon as possible in order to advance the
political process on the issue. China will maintain its
objective and impartial position and support the work of
the United Nations in promoting a political solution to
the Western Sahara issue. We encourage the parties to
seek ajust and lasting solution acceptable to all through
negotiations based on the relevant Council resolutions.
