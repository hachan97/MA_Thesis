The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of C6te d'Ivoire, Egypt, Ghana,
Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Sierra Leone and the Syrian
Arab Republic, in which they request to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, the
representatives of the aforementioned countries
took the seats reserved for them at the side of the
Council Chamber.

The President (spoke in Spanish): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Tuliameni Kalomoh, Assistant
Secretary-General for Political Affairs.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Kalomoh to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2003/1147, which contains the progress
report of the Secretary-General on the recommendations
of the Security Council mission to West Africa.

I now give the floor to Mr. Tuliameni Kalomoh,
Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs.
