Mr. Danon (Israel): Silence can be deafening, but
in our region silence kills. It is time for the Palestinian
leadership to end its silence and to start acting as
leaders. Mr. Mansour, you cannot condemn terrorism,
you cannot say it here: "I condemn all acts of terror."
You cannot say it here. People are looking to you,
Palestinian children are looking to you right now and
you cannot say, "I condemn all acts of terrorism." One
sentence you cannot say. One sentence you cannot say.
Shame on you for that. Shame on you for not being able
to say it.
