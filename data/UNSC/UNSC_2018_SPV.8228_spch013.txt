Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Before I speak about the draft resolution
before us (S/2018/175), I would like to say that I am
very happy that my British colleague is familiar with
the classic works of Marxism-Leninism, although that
is hardly surprising, because Marx, Engels and Lenin
were frequent visitors to London - indeed, Marx is
buried there. But I would like to cite another quotation
from Lenin, who wrote an article entitled "Better
Fewer, but Better".

After the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative
Mechanism (JIM) on the use of chemical weapons in
Syria ended, in November of last year, it was Russia
that found itself in the forefront of the efforts to fill the
resulting gap. We drafted a resolution on the issue that
we submitted to our colleagues for their consideration
on 23 January. The Western camp immediately gave
the draft text a hostile reception, since it eliminated the
loopholes that enabled investigations to be manipulated
and handed over to the control of the opponents of
Damascus, as occurred with the JIM. and which was the
reason for its premature demise. I want to emphasize
that we have not invented anything new in our text,
but have merely brought the principles for the work of
the new mechanism in line with the standards of the
Chemical Weapons Convention.

We now have a real opportunity to create a genuinely
independent and impartial working mechanism that
would help the Security Council to identify those
responsible for the use of chemical weapons in the
context of the conflict in Syria. All that it needs is
for Council members to vote in favour of our draft
resolution, and we call on them to do that.
