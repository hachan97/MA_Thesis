The President: The decision received 3 votes in favour, 6 votes against and 6 abstentions. The decision has not been adopted, having failed to obtain the required number of votes. (spoke in Russian) The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. I should like to draw the attention of Council members to document S/2020/961, which contains the text of a letter dated 29 September 2020 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council. I now give the floor to Mrs. Nakamitsu.
