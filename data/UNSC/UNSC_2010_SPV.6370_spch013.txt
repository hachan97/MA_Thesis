The President (spoke in Russian): I thank Major
General Paul Cruz for his briefing.

Before I give the floor to Security Council
members, I would like to welcome the Military Adviser
for peacekeeping operations, Lieutenant General
Chikadibia Obiakor, who, in accordance with the
understanding reached by the Security Council in its
prior consultations, is attending today's meeting in
accordance with rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure. As the General's term of office expires in
September 2010, I would like to thank him on behalf of
the Council for the job he has done and to wish him
every success in his future endeavours.

At this time, I now give the floor to members of
the Security Council.
