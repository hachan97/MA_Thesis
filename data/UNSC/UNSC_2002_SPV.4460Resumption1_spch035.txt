The President: I still have seven speakers
inscribed on my list. I am sure that Council members
will understand that there are quite a number of
commitments this evening - I myself have some. If
the Council members agree - and I hope you will
agree - I intend to suspend this meeting now and to
resume it tomorrow at 4.30 pm.

I wish to inform the Council that the informal
consultations on the Middle East will be convened
following the conclusion of our discussions on the
situation in Africa, which will, hopefully, be around
5.30 pm. I also wish to inform members that the
Secretariat has confirmed that the live webcast of the
Council's proceedings on this particular item will also
be provided tomorrow. I hope that no one will object to
the suspension of this meeting, and I thank you for
your understanding.
The meeting was suspended at 7.30pm.
