Mr. Bolton (United States of America): We are
pleased that the Security Council has taken this
important step in adopting resolution 1706 (2006). It is
imperative that we move immediately to implement it
fully to stop the tragic events unfolding in Darfur.
Every day we delay only adds to the suffering of the
Sudanese people and extends the genocide.

The United States calls on the Government of the
Sudan to comply with the terms of resolution 1706
(2006). We expect its full and unconditional
cooperation and support for the new United Nations
peacekeeping force. Failure on the part of the
Government of the Sudan to do so will significantly
undermine the Darfur Peace Agreement and prolong
the humanitarian crisis in Darfur.

Resolution 1706 (2006) sets the foundation for an
effective multidimensional international force. With
the expansion of the force up to 17,000 military
personnel and more than 3,000 civilian police, we can
now expect that the AMIS re-hatting will take place
rapidly and smoothly and that the follow-on United
Nations force will be fully operational, with a
substantial African element at its core.

Significant planning and logistical work has
already taken place. Now, with the adoption of this
resolution, we can begin finalizing those details as we
prepare to deploy the force. The United States is ready
to assist immediately in that regard. We cannot afford
to delay.

The Security Council upheld its responsibility
and adopted a strong resolution which offers the best
hope to bolster the Darfur Peace Agreement and end
the tragedy we are witnessing in Darfur. We must now
06-48422
devote all of our energies to securing its immediate and
full implementation.
