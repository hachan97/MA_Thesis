Sir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): I
want to make one simple point: that the United Nations
Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina has extremely
important work to do. It needs the support of the
Security Council, and I regard the adoption of this
resolution as indicating that support.

The lack of unanimity on parts of the resolution
should not be seen as detracting from that unanimous
support for what the United Nations Mission is doing.
Special Representative Klein and his full team have our
confidence in their task to build stability in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, which is so vital to the stability of the
region as a whole. We want to look to the future work
of the Mission as something which the Security
Council values, will follow with great interest and will
support with unanimity.
