Mr. O'Brien: As I have said on many occasions
before, my only authority comes from attempts to
ensure that we gather facts from the best sources
possible - both with our own eyes on the ground and
from those we are able to trust to produce the facts - and

to relay them to the Security Council in a completely
fair and honest manner. Where there are reports rather
than seen facts, we make judgments about the quality of
those reports. So, having laid out the best information
we have available, I stand by all the facts I outlined in
the statement Ijust made to the Council.

I can certainly stand by the facts I gave early in my
statement because that was my personal testimony, in
particular my sitting down at the bedside of Dr. Mazin
as he struggled for life, barely able to whisper. All he
could muster to say was "Please, peace". I think that
sums up precisely why we need to raise ourselves above
the level of disputes on the numbers, which simply
do not pay sufficient respect to the deep needs of the
people who are doing their very best to help or those
who continue to struggle after five years of a fight
that could be brought to an end if there were sufficient
political will - not least from the Government, which
represents an alternative factual base. I stand by the
facts that I presented, and I am more than happy to
write to the Council at a later stage, setting out further
helpful background details.
