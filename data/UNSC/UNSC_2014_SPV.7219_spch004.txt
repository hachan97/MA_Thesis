Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): We meet
today in the most tragic of circumstances. Yesterday,
Malaysia Airlines passenger flight MH-l7 appears to
have been shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing
all passengers and crew. Our deepest, most heartfelt
condolences go to the families of the victims and to the
people and Governments of those countries affected.
In the United Kingdom, we are mourning the loss of
at least nine British citizens who were passengers on
the flight. This is a dark moment for the international
community. The senseless violence unleashed by armed
separatists in eastern Ukraine has reached monstrous
proportions.

The precise circumstances and causes of this tragic
event must be established quickly and beyond any doubt.
As the Council has affirmed this morning, that will
require a full, thorough and independent international
investigation, in accordance with international civil
aviation guidelines. The International Civil Aviation
Organization, which provides the international legal
framework for the investigation of air accidents, should
have a central role to play in ensuring that there is
credible and independent international involvement.

We welcome the indications from the Ukrainian
authorities that they want international investigators
to join their efforts. The United Kingdom will
provide whatever assistance is necessary to support
that investigation. The immediate priority has to
be for investigators to gain access to the crash site
so they can start their work. They must be able to
operate unhindered and in security. There must be no
interference or tampering with the evidence. Armed
separatist groups in the vicinity must allow such
access. Despite assurances made yesterday evening,
we understand that has not yet happened. We call on
Russia to use its influence with those groups to ensure
that it happens. The special monitoring mission of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
already present in eastern Ukraine can play a key role
in facilitating and safeguarding access.

Early indications are that Malaysia Airlines Flight
MH-l7 was brought down by a surface-to-air missile.
The MH-17 is not the first aircraft to be brought
down in the area. On 14 June, armed separatists
claimed responsibility for - indeed, gloated publicly
over 4 the shooting down of a Ukrainian I1-76 transport
aircraft, with a loss of all 49 aboard. On 14 July, armed
separatists shot down an An-26 transport aircraft with
a surface-to-air missile. And, on 16 July, a Ukrainian
Su-25 jet was shot down in circumstances that have yet
to be fully clarified.

We have to ask searching questions about why
we are now confronting this tragic situation. Russian
officials have claimed that armed separatists in eastern
Ukraine represent a spontaneous local insurgency. We
know that is not the case. We know that the three leading
figures of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic are
Russian citizens who have come from outside Ukraine.
We know that weapons, equipment and logistical
support have been systematically provided to armed
separatist groups by Russia, including up to 100 man-
portable air defence systems and 15 to 25 main battle
tanks, not to mention artillery pieces, rocket launchers
and other armoured vehicles.

The United Kingdom urges Russia to reflect
carefully on the situation it has created. We urge Russia
to cease its policy of supporting armed separatist
groups and their violent actions of destabilizing a
neighbouring country and of generating displacement
and social and economic hardship. Let us hear today a
clear and unequivocal condemnation from Russia of the
actions of these armed groups. These armed groups do
not represent the people of Ukraine; without Russian
support, they would wither.

It is the Council's responsibility to respond to such
tragedies by drawing the right lessons and working
together with commitment and conviction to prevent
their repetition. It is clear where responsibility lies:
with the senseless violence of armed separatists and
with those who have supported, equipped and advised
them. The Council must be united in condemning these
actions and in demanding that these groups disarm,
desist from violence and intimidation and engage in
dialogue through the democratic mechanisms that are
available to them. They have been given opportunities
to do so, most recently through President Poroshenko's
peace plan. Those opportunities have all been spurned.

In the press statement agreed earlier today, the
members of the Security Council expressed their
condolences and called for an international investigation
and appropriate accountability. That is welcome, but it
is not enough. The Council must go further. It should
come together behind a clear demand that the armed
separatist groups should lay down their arms and
pursue whatever political legitimate objectives they
may have through exclusively peaceful and democratic
means, and that the flow of arms, fighters and logistical
support to the armed separatists be fully halted and the
borders secured. In the light of yesterday's tragedy, any
other course of action would be unconscionable.
