The President: I thank Mr. Oshima for his
briefing on the initiatives taken in follow-up to the
letter from the President of the Security Council
addressed to the Secretary-General on 21 June 2001.

As the purpose of this meeting was to hear the
briefing by the Under-Secretary-General, there is no
list of speakers for this meeting. I would therefore
invite those members who have questions to address to
Mr. Oshima to so indicate.
