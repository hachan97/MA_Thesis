Mr. De La Sabliere (France) (spoke in French):
France was a sponsor of the draft resolution on the
fight against terrorism that we have just adopted. We
are grateful to the Russian Federation for having taken
the initiative on that resolution, which will strengthen
international cooperation to combat terrorism. We were
gratified to see that this important text was adopted by
consensus.

The resolution is important for several reasons. It
energetically affirms that terrorist acts are
unjustifiable, it calls upon all States to prevent such
acts and to make sure that there are punishments
consistent with their gravity, it reiterates that
combating terrorism is an activity that must be carried
out in accordance with international law, in particular,
international human rights and humanitarian law, it
calls upon the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) to
strengthen its activities, including visits to States,
which will make it possible to enhance dialogue, and it
calls upon the CTC Executive Directorate to endow
itself with all the necessary means to support the CTC,
and it tasks a specific Security Council working group
to think of new ways to strengthen anti-terrorist efforts.

We hope the working group will discharge its
mandate without haste, and in a careful, reflective
manner. The questions it will have to tackle are
complex ones. It will have to think about how it can
further strengthen the activities of the CTC. It will
have to examine the possibility of establishing a list of
individuals, groups and entities of a terrorist nature. In
so doing, it will have to learn from the lessons of the
Al Qaeda sanctions Committee. The credibility of our
activities, and therefore there effectiveness, depends on
that. It is indispensable that the international
community act in a unanimous manner in this area and
France, for one, will be an active contributor.
