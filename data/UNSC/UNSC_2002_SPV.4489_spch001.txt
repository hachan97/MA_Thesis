The President: In accordance with the decision
taken at the 4488th meeting this morning, I invite the
Permanent Observer of Palestine to take a seat at the
Council table.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Al-Kidwa

The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document 5/2002/259, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by the United States of
America.

I would like to draw attention to a revision to the
sixth preambular paragraph, namely, to add the words
"and others" after the words "the United Nations
Special Coordinator".

It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
before it. If I hear no objection, I shall now put the
draft resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements before the voting.
