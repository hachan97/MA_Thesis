Mr. Jacob (Israel): I regret the tone and the
content of the statement just made by the Palestinian
Observer. In view of the fact that his statement was
well prepared, I particularly regret the use of terms
such as "silly" and "stupid". I believe that we should
conduct the business of this important body in a
parliamentary manner. The terms he used are not in
line with the parliamentary manner.

My delegation reserves the right to make an
additional intervention tomorrow in response to some
of the allegations raised by the Palestinian Observer.
