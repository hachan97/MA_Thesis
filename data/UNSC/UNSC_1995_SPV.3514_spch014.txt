Mr. Lamamra (Algeria) (interpretation from French):
It is a great pleasure for me to express to you, Sir, the
Algerian delegation's and my own warmest congratulations
on your assumption of the presidency of the Security
Council. I am delighted that the important deliberations
today are being led by a distinguished diplomat who is
quite naturally attentive to all the dimensions of the
question under consideration.

I would also like to express to your predecessor, the
Permanent Representative of China, our deep appreciation
for the manner in which he conducted the Council's
proceedings last month.

Lastly, I should like to express the Algerian
delegation's support for the statement that will be made
by the Permanent Representative of Indonesia on behalf
of the non-aligned countries parties to the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We have taken
note of the contents of that statement with satisfaction.

The Charter of the United Nations affirmed
forcefully, among its cardinal principles, the commitment
of the States Members of the Organization to refrain in
their international relations from the threat or use of
force. The Charter also stipulated, as the primary purpose
of the United Nations, the maintenance of international
peace and security through

"effective collective measures for the prevention and
removal of threats to the peace, and for the
suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches
of the peace".

These references, drawn from the key legal instrument
that establishes the order of contemporary international
relations, are particularly relevant when the threat or use
of force and acts of aggression may involve nuclear
weapons whose destructive capacity threatens the very
existence of the human race. These references are also
relevant in explaining the nature and the scope of the
security assurances which, on the initiative of the
permanent members of the Security Council, in their
capacity of nuclear-weapon Powers, it is envisaged are to
be granted to the non-nuclear-weapon States parties to the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

The current debate is undoubtedly timely, and we are
grateful to those who initiated it for having seen the need
for the Security Council resolutely to heed the aspirations
of the peoples of the United Nations and to try to make
its contribution to dealing with the global challenges that
affect mankind's future because of the threats they pose
to international peace and security. This debate is all the
more timely since it is taking place after the international
community has fully entered into a qualitatively new
stage born of the disappearance of the bipolar and
conflictual structure of the world, and on the eve of the
Review and Extension Conference of States parties to the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

 

The question of security assurances for the non-
nuclear-weapon States is part of the overall problem of the
maintenance of international peace and security in relation
to nuclear disarmament. That is why this question has
always been at the very heart of the concerns and proposals
of the Movement of Non-aligned Countries, whose member
States have consistently affirmed the need for negative
security assurances, enshrined in a binding international
legal instrument, while rightly emphasizing that the true
assurance against the threat or use of nuclear weapons is
the complete elimination of this type of weapon. From this
standpoint, the initiative of the five nuclear-weapon Powers,
which is moving in a promising direction as regards
positive guarantees, contains - because of the deliberately
modest status given to the initiative proposed to the Council
and because of its scope, which is limited to an updating of
resolution 255 (1968) of 19 June 1968, which Algeria was
not able to support when the Council adopted it -
shortcomings which have significantly reduced its historic
role at a time which is conducive to conceptual and
operational breakthroughs in this field.

Many of the additions and improvements that the non-
aligned countries suggested to the sponsors of the draft
resolution under consideration were inspired by the twofold
legitimate hope of making this exercise a successful
example of partnership in identifying the needs and
designing the appropriate responses, and of ensuring that
the text to be adopted will constitute a solid base of
effective and irrevocable commitments undertaken in
solidarity by the nuclear-weapon States, with the full
adherence of the States that are the beneficiaries of those
commitments. It is in particular a question of placing the
draft resolution firmly in the framework of Chapter VII of
the Charter and of drawing the legal implications from this,
with a view to establishing a system of positive security
assurances organized around the three principles of
deterrence, assistance and compensation, which would be
set under way by the automatic and unconditional action of
the Security Council.

Since it does not reflect factors which are unassailably
true, since it does not incorporate elements which determine
the very effectiveness of the assurances envisaged, this draft
resolution objectively falls far short of the coherence
required by this undertaking and of the expectations of the
international community in this respect. In this context, the
Security Council's awakening to a pressing issue that is
part of the adaptation of international relations to the
circumstances of the next century will not, unfortunately,
bring about the healthy break with the restrictive and weak
approaches to controlling the course of history which have
too often been characteristic of the political management
of the atomic age.

Just as history proves that every weapon invented by
man has come to be used, it is very widely held that the
mere existence of nuclear weapons is a factor for
insecurity. While the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons has undeniably played a stabilizing role
in respect of horizontal proliferation, vertical
proliferation - which has developed in its shadow and
which devours colossal sums of money - is fuelled by
doctrines of deterrence and other balance-of-terror
theories, all of them based on a logic of confrontation.
The post-cold-war period should be able to free political
will of past inhibition and sluggishness, to encourage a
profound renewal of strategic thinking, establishing the
obsolescence of the military uses of the atom, giving a
decisive impetus to nuclear disarmament in the
foreseeable future to achieve the complete elimination of
nuclear weapons, and ensuring the promotion of a new
concept of human security based on economic prosperity
and social well-being. That would be the best way to keep
the Charter promise to save succeeding generations from
the scourge of war and to protect those generations from
the madness that made mankind strive to acquire the
means to guarantee its own destruction.
