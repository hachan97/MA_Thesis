The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now continue its consideration of the item
on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Following consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council notes with concern
that the plundering of the natural resources and
other forms of wealth of the Democratic Republic
of the Congo continues unabated. The Security
Council strongly condemns these activities,
which are perpetuating the conflict in the country,
impeding the economic development of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo and
exacerbating the suffering of its people, and
reaffirms the territorial integrity, political
independence, and sovereignty of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, including over its natural
resources.

"The Security Council stresses that:

"No external parties, or groups or
individuals under their control, should
benefit from the exploitation of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo's natural
resources at the Democratic Republic of the
Congo's expense;

"The Democratic Republic of the Congo's
natural resources should not serve as an
incentive for any State, group or individual
to prolong the conflict;

"External parties, and groups or individuals

under their control, must not use the natural
resources of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo to finance the conflict in the country;
"The resources should be exploited legally
and on a fair commercial basis to benefit the
country and people of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.

"The Security Council thanks the Expert
Panel for its recommendations on the
institutional, financial and technical aspects of
the issue, and for its advice on possible measures
to be imposed by the Security Council. It
reaffirms its support for the Lusaka Ceasefire
Agreement, and reiterates its commitment to take
any appropriate action to help put an end to the
plundering of the resources of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, in support of the peace
process, once it has been established that such
actions will have no serious and unmanageable
negative impact on the disastrous humanitarian
and economic situation of the country.

"The Security Council stresses the
importance of continuing the monitoring of the
situation regarding the illegal exploitation of the
natural resources of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo and the link between the exploitation
of these natural resources in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and the continuation of the
conflict, in order to keep the necessary pressure
to put an end to the illegal exploitation of the
resources of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, including the exploitation of human
resources, at the expense of the Congolese people
and of the peace process.

"Therefore, the Security Council, having
heard the Views expressed at its open debate on
14 December 2001, requests the Secretary-
General to renew the mandate of the Expert Panel
for a period of six months, at the end of which the
Expert Panel should report to the Council. The
Panel should submit an interim report after three
months.

"The next reports of the Panel should
include the following elements:

"An update of relevant data and an analysis

of further information from all relevant

countries, including in particular from those
which thus far have not provided the panel
with the requested information;

"An evaluation of the possible actions that
could be taken by the Council, including
those recommended by the Panel in its
report (S/2001/357) and in its addendum
(S/2001/1072), in order to help bring to an
end the plundering of the natural resources
of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
taking into account the impact of such
actions on the financing of the conflict and
their potential impact on the humanitarian
and economic situation of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo;

"Recommendations on specific actions that
the international community, in support of
the Government of the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, might take, working through
existing international organizations,
mechanisms and United Nations bodies, to
address the issues in the report and its
addendum;

"Recommendations on possible steps that
may be taken by transit countries as well as
end users to contribute to ending illegal
exploitation of the natural resources and
other forms of wealth of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.

"The Security Council stresses the
importance of the panel maintaining a high level
of collaboration with all the Congolese players,
governmental as well as non-governmental,
throughout the national territory.

"The Security Council once again urges the
Governments named in the previous reports to
conduct their own inquiries, cooperate fully with
the Expert Panel and take, on an urgent basis, the
necessary steps to end all illegal exploitation of
the natural resources of the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, by their nationals or others under
their control, and inform the Council accordingly.
The Security Council also calls on those countries
that have not yet provided the panel with the
requested information to do so as a matter of
urgency."

This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2001/39.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 6.35 pm.
