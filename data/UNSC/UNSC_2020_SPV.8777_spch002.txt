Mr. Singer Weisinger (Dominican Republic) (spoke in Spanish): | have the honour to brief the members of the Council in my capacity as Chair of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 2374 (2017) concerning Mali. In my statement, I intend to reflect on my role as Chair since 1 January 2020 to the present, and in so doing highlight the work of the Committee and the Panel of Experts since the beginning of the year. Since the beginning of this year, the Committee has met three times. On 12 February, the Committee held informal consultations to consider the midterm report of the Panel of Experts on Mali, submitted to the Security Council in accordance with paragraph 4 of resolution 2484 (2019). This year, on 2 March, the members of the Committee met with the representative of Mali, as well as representatives of the countries of the region, including Algeria, Burkina Faso, Chad, Cete d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mauritania, Morocco and the Niger, pursuant to paragraph 9 (e) of resolution 2374 (2017) and paragraph 2 (a) (v) of the guidelines of the Committee for the conduct of its work. In the light of the challenges posed by the coronavirus disease pandemic to the Committee's usual working procedures, including the limitations on holding in-person meetings, and to ensure the continuity of its work, the members of the Committee agreed, on an exceptional basis, to hold informal virtual meetings in the form of closed video-teleconferences. The first such meeting was held on 5 August. During that meeting, the Committee heard a presentation on the final report of the Panel of Experts on Mali (S/2019/636), submitted in accordance with paragraph 4 of resolution 2432 (2018). Since the establishment of the Committee to date, there have been eight individuals on the resolution 2374 (2017) sanctions list. Finally, as mandated by the Security Council, the Panel of Experts submitted to the Security Council its final report on 7 August.
