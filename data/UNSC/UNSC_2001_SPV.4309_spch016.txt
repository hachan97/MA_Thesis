The President: Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. You
make us think, as usual. I think we need to remember
that as far as the boulder going up the mountain is
concerned, there is a trade off between the speed with
which you try to push the boulder up the mountain and
the risk of it coming back over you and tumbling back
to the bottom again. But it is we and others who have
to make those judgements.
