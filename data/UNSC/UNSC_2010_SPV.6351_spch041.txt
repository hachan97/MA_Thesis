Mr. De Mistura (spoke in Spanish): I thank you,
Sir, for giving me the floor a second time.

(spoke in English)

First of all, I thank the Council for all the
comments. We have taken careful note of the many
good and constructive pieces of advice we have heard.

I have three brief points. The first one is that
security is a concern, and participants have been kind
enough to remind us of what happened yesterday. In
fact, some of us who were together in J alalabad on the
field trip will remember that there was even yesterday
an incident at the airport. This is a clear reminder that
security is an area in which I myself, on behalf of the
Council, will constantly have to square the circle
between being proactive, being present, being
everywhere and at the same time staying alive. The
combination of these will be the challenge that we are
going to face during this critical, crucial period, which
will be important for Afghanistan and for all of us.

I would like also, on behalf of each of my
colleagues, and certainly on behalf of the Secretary-
General, to thank the Council for the trust and
confidence it has placed in me and my team in
Afghanistan. We need that trust and confidence when
things get rough - and they are likely to be rough
before they get better.

That having been said, the feeling that I am
having - perhaps because I am overly optimistic by
nature and by professional need - is that the Afghans
will find a way. This year is the year when they will be
indicating to us in which direction they will go. That is
why the issue of security becomes important - and
remains important - but our resilience becomes even
more important.
