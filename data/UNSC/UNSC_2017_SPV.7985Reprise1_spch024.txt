Mr. Ramirez Carrefio (Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): At the outset, I am pleased to see
you, Ambassador Sacha Llorentty Soliz, a son of
Bolivia - our liberator's favourite country - presiding
over the Security Council this month. You have done an
outstanding job and we wish to congratulate you.

It is an honour for the Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela to speak on behalf of the Movement of
Non-Aligned Countries.
First of all, allow me to convey, on behalf of the
member States of the Movement, our best wishes to
the delegation of the Plurinational State of Bolivia
for a successful month in conducting the work of the
Council, as well as our appreciation for its efforts in
the drafting of the concept note for this meeting, which
serves as a basis for guiding our discussions today.

We also take this opportunity to acknowledge the
dedication with which the delegation of Uruguay led
the work of this organ during the month of May.

During the seventeenth Summit of the Non-Aligned
Movement, held in September 2016 on Margarita
Island, Venezuela, the Heads of State and Government
reiterated their ongoing concern about the difficult
and complex situation in the area of disarmament and
international security, and called for the redoubling of
efforts in order to break the current stalemate in the
pursuit of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation
in all its aspects. On that occasion, the Heads of State
and Government also reaffirmed the Movement's
principled positions on nuclear disarmament, which
remains its top priority, and on the non-proliferation of
nuclear weapons in all its aspects, while emphasizing
the importance of ensuring that efforts towards nuclear
non-proliferation are concurrent to efforts towards
nuclear disarmament. They also expressed concern
about the threat posed to humankind by the existence of
nuclear weapons and their possible use or threat of use.

Similarly, in relation to chemical weapons, the
countries of the Movement that are States parties to
the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development,
Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons
and on Their Destruction (CWC) note with satisfaction
its effective operation as the only comprehensive
multilateral treaty banning an entire category of
weapons of mass destruction, establishing a system
of verification and promoting the use of chemicals for
peaceful purposes. With regard to future priorities, the
countries of the Movement that are States parties to the
CWC consider that the primary objective should remain
the complete elimination of all categories of chemical
weapons, with the firm conviction that all pillars of the
Convention will be treated in a balanced way.

Similarly, with respect to biological weapons, the
countries of the Movement that are States parties to the
Biological Weapons Convention are of the view that
the Convention represents an important component of
the international legal architecture related to weapons
of mass destruction, but recognize that the lack of
a verification system continues to undermine the
effectiveness of the Convention, and urge parties that
reject the resumption of multilateral negotiations on a
legally binding protocol to reconsider their policy.

In reaffirming the absolute validity of
multilateral diplomacy in the field of disarmament
and non-proliferation, the Non-Aligned Movement
reiterates its determination to promote multilateralism
as a fundamental principle of disarmament and
non-proliferation negotiations.

On the other hand, the member States of the
Movement stress that the most effective way to prevent
the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction by
terrorists is the total elimination of such weapons, while
emphasizing the need to urgently make progress in the
area of disarmament and non-proliferation in order to
contribute to the maintenance of international peace
and security and to boost global counter-terrorism
efforts. That issue is of particular concern to us,
given the fact that terrorist groups have used chemical

weapons in the past, including in countries that are part
of the Movement.

In that regard, we call on all Member States to
support international efforts to prevent the acquisition
of weapons of mass destruction and their means of
delivery by terrorists, and urge Member States to adopt
and strengthen national measures, as appropriate, so as
to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass
destruction, their delivery systems and materials and
technologies related to their production.

The member States of the Movement encourage
cooperation between the international community and
the relevant international and regional organizations
to strengthen national capacities, in line with General
Assembly resolution 70/36, with a view to strengthening
the national capacities of States and curbing the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including
to non-State actors and terrorist groups - in keeping
with the relevant obligations in the framework of the
international legal architecture related to weapons of
mass destruction.

Also, in noting the adoption of Security Council
resolutions 1540 (2004), 1673 (2006), 1810 (2008) and
1977 (2011), we stress the need to ensure that no action
by the Security Council undermines the Charter of the
United Nations and the existing multilateral treaties
on weapons of mass destruction and the international
organizations established in that regard, as well as the
role of the General Assembly. We also caution against
the recurring practice of the Security Council to use its
authority to define legislative requirements for Member
States to implement the decisions of this organ. In
that regard, we want to emphasize the importance of
ensuring that the issue of non-State actors' acquisition
of weapons of mass destruction is addressed in an
inclusive manner by the General Assembly so that the
views of all Member States are taken into account.

The Movement also welcomes the successful
conclusion of the third session of the Open-ended
Working Group on the Fourth Special Session of the
General Assembly Devoted to Disarmament. We would
like to stress the importance ofconvening such a special
session, which would provide us with an opportunity to
consider the most critical aspects of the disarmament
process from a perspective that is more in line with
the current international situation, and to mobilize the
international community and public opinion in support
of eliminating nuclear weapons and other weapons
of mass destruction and controlling and reducing the
availability of conventional weapons.

In conclusion, in maintaining its commitment to
banning the development of new types of weapons
of mass destruction, the Non-Aligned Movement
reiterates its adherence to the objectives and principles
outlined in General Assembly resolution 69/27, entitled
"Prohibition of the development and manufacture of
new types of weapons of mass destruction and new
systems of such weapons: report of the Conference
on Disarmament".
