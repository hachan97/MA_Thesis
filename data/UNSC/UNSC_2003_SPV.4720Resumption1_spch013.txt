The President (spoke in French): I thank the
representative of France for his kind words addressed
to me.

Before calling upon the next speaker, I would like
to ask the Regional Director of the Programme for
Coordination and Assistance for Security and
Development to react briefly to some questions that
were raised by the representative of France.
