Mrs. ngu (Nigeria): We are indeed glad to have
arrived at a decision point on the situation in Libya.
Nigeria remains deeply concerned about the escalating
violence, the inflammatory rhetoric and the deplorable
loss of life we are witnessing in Libya. The African
Union, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and
the League of Arab States have all condemned the
disproportionate use of force against civilians in Libya
and have called for the immediate cessation of such
violence.

It is therefore fitting that the Security Council has
taken decisive action today to address the crisis. We
support the package of sanctions in the resolution to
the extent that their impact is targeted and does not
exacerbate the burden upon Libyan citizens. We have
taken into consideration the letter dated today from the
Permanent Representative of Libya supporting the
measures as we have proposed. We are further
persuaded by the cries for help of the Libyan people.

In response to these calls for action, the
comprehensive sanctions will deter individuals from
supporting or otherwise assisting the regime.
Moreover, the terms of the resolution will isolate those
currently planning, coordinating and directing the
atrocities.

Nigeria is satisfied that the resolution provides
for the protection of civilians and respect for
international humanitarian and human rights law. We
believe that the full implementation of these measures
will swiftly and effectively address the ongoing crisis.
