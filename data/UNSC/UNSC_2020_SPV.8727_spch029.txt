Mr. Sinirlioglu (Turkey): I will be very short. Again, I will emphasize that the previous speaker does not represent Syrians. He represents only a very bloody regime that is waging a war against its own people. They do not deserve to be seated behind the Syrian name plate in this Chamber. Their continued presence behind the name plate is just a political aberration. It does not make them the legitimate representatives of the Syrian people. As I said, more Syrians are under our care than under theirs.
