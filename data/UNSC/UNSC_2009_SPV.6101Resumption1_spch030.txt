Mr. Annabi: I would like to thank the members
of the Security Council for their strong expressions of
support for the performance of the United Nations
Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) and for
the stabilization process in Haiti in general. I will share
the comments made by the members of the Council
today with the members of our team, who will, I am
sure, find them very encouraging. We hope that this
support can be sustained, including in particular in the
context of the upcoming Washington conference.
I would also like, especially at a time when
Mexico is presiding over the Security Council, to place
on record my strong appreciation for the critical
contribution that the Latin American countries are
making, with others, to the work of MINUSTAH. In
that connection, I would like to acknowledge in
particular the contribution that our outgoing Force
Commander, General Santos Cruz, has made to the
improvement of the security situation in Haiti and to
acknowledge his highly effective leadership during the
27 months that he has spent with us in MINUSTAH.

I would also like to express my gratitude to the
Organization of American States for its cooperation
and its support to the electoral process through the
registration of voters, as well as for the support that
they are providing to the Haitian authorities in the
printing and distribution of identity cards to eligible
voters.

Finally, Mr. President, I would like to thank you
for organizing this important debate and for your
helpful observations, and those of members of the
Council. We will certainly bear them in mind,
including the comments of Ambassador Urbina on
sustainability, which are clearly very relevant. I believe
that we need to continue to work together to create an
environment in Haiti that is sustainable not only from
the point of security, but also in order to place the
country on a durable development track so that when
the time comes MINUSTAH can leave without having
to return.
