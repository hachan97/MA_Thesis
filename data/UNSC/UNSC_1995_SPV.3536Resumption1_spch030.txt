The President (interpretation from French): I thank
the representative of Japan for his kind words addressed
to me.

In View of the lateness of the hour and the number
of speakers remaining on my list, I intend, with the
concurrence of the members of the Council, to suspend
the meeting now.

The meeting was suspended at 1 pm.
