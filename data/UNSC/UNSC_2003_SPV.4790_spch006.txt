Mr. Spatafora (Italy): I am taking the floor on
behalf of the Italian Presidency of the Council of the
European Union. Mr. President, I wish to thank you,
first of all for organizing this public meeting on the
situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and
for giving the European Union the opportunity to
address the Security Council on that relevant issue. On
behalf of the European Union, it is my pleasure to
introduce Mr. Javier Solana, Secretary-General and
High Representative for the Common Foreign and
Security Policy of the European Union. He is ready to
take the floor as soon as you will allow him to do so.
