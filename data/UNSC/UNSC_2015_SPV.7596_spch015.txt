Mrs. ngu (Nigeria): I thank you, Madam
President, for convening this meeting. We are also
grateful to thebriefers - Special Envoy of the
Secretary-General Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, High
Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al
Hussein, whom I welcome back to the Council, and
Ms. Kyung-wha Kang. We wish to thank them for their
updates on the situation in Yemen.

We have very closely followed the mediation
efforts of Special Envoy Ould Cheikh Ahmed. We
commend him for his commitment to searching for
peace in Yemen. Getting the Government of President
Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour and the Houthis to
engage in discussions for the first time is in itself is
a very encouraging development that we can describe
as a significant silver lining in the cloud. We wish to
welcome the agreement reached by the parties on the
broad framework for ending the conflict. Particularly
noteworthy are the confidence-building measures
agreed by the parties, including the release of prisoners
and the facilitation of humanitarian access.

We are concerned, however, that a permanent
ceasefire has not yet been agreed. An enduring
ceasefire, we believe, will be the most effective
confidence-building measure. We encourage the parties
to extend the current temporary ceasefire to make it
permanent. Even with a temporary ceasefire in place,
numerous violations have rendered it tenuous. It is not
enough to have a ceasefire; the parties must refrain
from violence during the ceasefire. That is a crucial
first step in de-escalating the conflict and improving
the humanitarian situation in Yemen. We look forward
to the resumption of talks on 14 January. It is our hope
that they will build a scaffolding on top of the gains of
the first round to produce an outcome that will end the
conflict in Yemen.
