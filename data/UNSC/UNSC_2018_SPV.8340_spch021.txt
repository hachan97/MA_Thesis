Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): At
the outset, I should like to congratulate you, Madam
President, and your team on assuming the September
presidency of the Security Council. I also thank the
United Kingdom for its work in the presidency of the
Council in August.

China has consistently called for respect for
countries' sovereignty, independence, unity and
territorial integrity, as well as for adherence to the
principle of non-interference in internal affairs. China
is of the view that the situation in Nicaragua does not
constitute a threat to international peace and security
and that the Security Council should not get involved.
