Mr. Ilkin (Turkey): Mr. President, in view of
your request, I shall be extremely brief. Let me first
thank you for organizing today's debate on United
Nations peacekeeping operations. I would also like to
thank Mr. Alain Le Roy, Ms. Susana Malcorra and
Special Representative Hedi Annabi for the extensive,
thought-provoking and clear presentations they made at
the beginning of the debate.

I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute
to all the United Nations and other peacekeepers
throughout the world who risk their lives to make our
planet a more peaceful and safe place to live.

The debate today and the exercise that we are
launching is indeed timely. As a major troop-
contributor, we will actively participate in the debate
and in the review process.

We will soon make available the text I was
intending to read out.

Let me also wish continued health, happiness and
success to our colleague, Francis Butagira.
