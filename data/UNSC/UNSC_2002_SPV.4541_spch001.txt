representatives of Afghanistan, Canada, India, the
Islamic Republic of Iran, Japan, New Zealand,
Pakistan, Spain and Turkey, in which they request to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on

practice. I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37

take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
