I will be very brief. Today's discussion is evidence of the long way we have come in our efforts to understand and begin to address, thanks to the support and leadership of Member States in this and other forums, the impact of climate change on peace and security. But let us make no mistake - our actions lag behind our words. The multilateral response to the security implications of climate change does not match the magnitude of the challenge we are facing. Much more work lies ahead of us. We must work together, and we must move faster. In this regard, from the Secretariat, we look forward to more partnerships and collaboration at all levels.
