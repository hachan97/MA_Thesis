Mr. Cardenas (Argentina) (interpretation from Spanish): A few days ago the Security Council, with some
sense of hope, adopted three resolutions that established
new mandates for the United Nations presence in the
former Yugoslavia. Today, on the other hand, the Council
has just adopted resolution 987 (1995) because of the
alarming, continuing and serious deterioration of the
situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in particular, and in
Croatia.

The cowardly assassination of two French soldiers of
the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) must
serve as a warning and must make us think about the future
role of the United Nations in the conflict area.

We have stated before, and we will continue tirelessly
to state, that if the parties do not wish to help themselves
the United Nations cannot do so in their place. If this is
indeed the case we must very soon consider carefully the
options available to us in the future.

The Argentine Republic views the death of a United
Nations soldier, whatever his nationality, in the same way
and with the same sense of sorrow as it would the death of
one of its own soldiers. In addition, we feel deep
indignation at the cruel cowardliness with which the lives
of the French soldiers were snuffed out.

 
The parties to the conflict must understand that such
acts are inadmissible and that those responsible deserve
the international community's strongest rejection and
condemnation and must shoulder their responsibility in
keeping with the norms of international law. We hope that
this will indeed be the case.

At this time my delegation would like to express its
complete solidarity with and sympathy for the French
delegation as well as the members of the families and the
friends of the soldiers who gave their lives while fulfilling
a noble duty - so diametrically different from the
assassins, who lack the most elementary morals.
