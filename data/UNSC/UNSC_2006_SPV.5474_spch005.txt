The President: I thank Judge Higgins for her

briefing, which has been most informative and

encouraging, and which has provided us with a lot of
food for thought.

Before opening the floor, I wish to remind all
speakers to limit their statements to no more than five
minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its
work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy
statements are kindly requested to circulate their texts
in writing and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking in the Chamber.
