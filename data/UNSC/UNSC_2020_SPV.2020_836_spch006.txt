We thank Under-Secretary-General Vladimir Voronkov and Executive Director Michele Coninsx for briefing us today on the threat posed by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) (Da'esh). Of particular concern to us, having anticipated the latest report of the Secretary-General on the subject (S/2020/774), is precisely the status of that threat as a result of the devastating reality facing the world owing to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We have witnessed and condemn the increase in the number of attacks and actions by ISIL in places such as Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic, where it is consolidating its presence at this crucial moment when Governments are focusing their actions and limited resources on saving lives and fighting to contain the spread of the virus. Despite the achievements made in the fight against ISIL, in particular at the top of its core organization - and here we commend the various counter-terrorism- strategy operations taking place - its ability to mutate and adapt to new modalities in the face of external events, as in the case of the pandemic, requires that we remain on the offensive. We also consider it important to pay due attention to the socioeconomic impact of the crisis resulting from the pandemic as an element that could exacerbate conditions conducive to terrorism in the medium to long term. We also wish to stress our concern about the serious humanitarian situation that people with alleged links to ISIL continue to face in camps and detention centres in conflict zones, as they are exposed to deplorable conditions, particularly women and children - many of whom are the victims of sexual violence - who, in the case of Al-Hol camp, in Syria, make up the vast majority of its population. COVID-19 has added an additional element of destabilization to the already serious situation in those centres, exposing those admitted to a high risk of contagion, to the detriment of efforts in the area of protection, repatriation, processing, rehabilitation and reintegration, given the need to reallocate resources to combat the pandemic. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen initiatives and programmes designed to counter the risk of exploitation and radicalization in camps and detention centres, with assistance from specialized United Nations agencies in the development of internal strategies and protocols aimed at better addressing the humanitarian, human rights and security situation, also counting on the important support of the international community. Given the mobility and confinement restrictions imposed by COVID-19, which have considerably increased the time spent online, we urge the relevant monitoring bodies to maintain the alert levels necessary to act against the increase in cybercrime for financing and ISIL propaganda in the media aimed at inspiring attacks by its affiliates and supporters. Likewise, of concern is the threat posed by the numerous foreign terrorist fighters and the return of many of them to their countries of origin, as they continue to pose substantial political, legal, operational and security challenges to Member States. Let me conclude by recognizing the essential work, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, of specialized United Nations agencies such as the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate, the United Nations Investigative Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes Committed by Da'esh/ Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, and UNICEF.
