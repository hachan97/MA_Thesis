Mr. Bessho (Japan): Japan welcomes the
unanimous adoption of resolution 2352 (2017). We
thank the United States for its strong determination to
lead the negotiations and for its engagement throughout
the process. We would also like to highly commend the
flexibility of Ethiopia in supporting the resolution.

Japan voted in favour of the resolution based on the
need to maintain the relative calm in Abyei and improve
the functioning of the Joint Border Verification and
Monitoring Mechanism. The role of the United Nations
Interim Security Force for Abyei has been crucial in
the absence of the Abyei Area administration council
and police service. We thank Ethiopia for its efforts in
that regard.

Japan is encouraged that grassroots dialogue
between the Ngok Dinka and the Misseriya continues
and that the Amiet common market is benefiting both
tribes. However, we are disappointed by the lack of
political progress to bolster those developments.

The Abyei Joint Oversight Committee and a Joint
Political and Security Mechanism are very important
to build confidence on pending issues such as the
final status of Abyei as well as the demarcation and
demilitarization ofthe Safe Demilitarized Border Zone.

Japan, as a matter of principle, supports
streamlining United Nations peacekeeping missions
through improved efficiency. We believe that, on
each peacekeeping operation, the Council should hold
in-depth discussions and make judgments on mandates
or ceilings we authorize, based on their individual
merits. We welcome the fact that the Council was able
to decide unanimously to make a final extension of its
support to the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring
Mechanism, unless clear conditions are met.
