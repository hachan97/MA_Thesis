Mrs. ngu (Nigeria): Nigeria view the crisis in
Syria as an internal conflict that requires a political
solution. However, as the fighting remains brutal and
intractable and assumes a new dimension with the
involvement of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant,
the attendant humanitarian situation calls for concerted
international action for effective address.

Resolution 2165 (2014) seeks to accomplish that
objective. Nigeria voted in favour of the resolution in
the collective search for a remedy for the protracted
situation being endured by the Syrian people. The
resolution authorizes the United Nations and its
implementing partners to deliver humanitarian
assistance across borders and conflict lines and to
facilitate the delivery of humanitarian supplies to those
in need. It also establishes a monitoring mechanism
to ensure that the contents of aid convoys are indeed
intended for humanitarian use.

The adoption of resolution 2165 (2014) today is a
demonstration of the unrelenting commitment of the
Security Council to work assiduously in the higher
interests of the Syrian people. We expect that this
resolute effort will continue to serve as a model in the
Council's future efforts. We reiterate the imperative
for a political solution to the Syrian crisis and we urge
all parties to work towards the implementation of the
30 June 2012 Geneva communique (8/2012/522, annex).

It is in that regard that we welcome the appointment
of Mr. Staffan de Mistura as the new Special Envoy of
the Secretary-General for Syria, and urge the parties
to utilize his good offices and wealth of experience
towards the attainment of an amicable solution to the
impasse.

I would like to thank the delegations of Australia,
Jordan and Luxembourg for their leadership in driving
the negotiation process, which culminated in today's
remarkable, unanimous resolution.
