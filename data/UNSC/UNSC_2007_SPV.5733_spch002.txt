Mr. Kumalo (South Africa): South Africa
supports the renewal of the mandate of the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for an
additional year, as recommended by the Secretary-
General and as requested by the Prime Minister of
Lebanon. However, my delegation would have
preferred to have had a draft resolution of a technical
nature. There is no reason to have included in the draft
resolution unrelated sensitive issues which the Council
has on numerous previous occasions commented on in
various resolutions and presidential statements. We are
concerned that these unrelated issues tend to be
selectively chosen from other resolutions and
statements of the past.

While we are not entirely satisfied with all of the
elements of the draft resolution before us, my
delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution
because we continue to believe that UNIFIL has a
positive role to play in bringing about long-term peace
and security in Lebanon.
