Mr. Munzberg: Mr. President, we would like to
thank you for the opportunity to intervene at this
meeting of the Security Council on the Peacebuilding
Commission.

The Peacebuilding Commission is a very useful
forum where all relevant aspects of a country in a post-
conflict situation can be addressed in a comprehensive

fashion. We are prepared to cooperate actively with
that forum. As members know, the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) is already involved in a number
of post-conflict cases, including in the two countries
that are on the agenda of the country-specific meetings
of the Commission. We share the Commission's
emphasis on work on concrete country cases and on
country ownership of strategies. Our activities and
those of the Commission need to be well integrated in
those country-owned strategies.

The Commission has made good progress,
together with the countries concerned, in identifying
priority areas that need to be addressed. We have
interacted with the Commission in the country
meetings and also in the field. Interactive discussions
are of particular value.

We appreciate the fact that the IMF will be
invited to meetings of the Commission, as stated in the
resolution establishing the Peacebuilding Commission.
In that regard, it would be useful if the issue of
attendance at meetings of the Organizational
Committee could be clarified.

We are satisfied that the Commission will be an
advisory body, and, accordingly, we will inform our
governing organs of the progress of the Commission's
work in order to ensure that their decisions are
informed by the Commission's deliberations on the
whole spectrum of aspects relevant to a specific case.
