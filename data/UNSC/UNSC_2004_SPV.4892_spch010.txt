Mr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): I am most
grateful for the complete and detailed briefing you
have given us, Sir, on the work of the Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999). As the
representative of Ireland will speak on behalf of the
European Union, I shall confine my statement to a few
brief comments.

The fight against terrorism is an absolute priority
for Spain. Unfortunately, the threat posed by Al Qaeda
and the Taliban continues to loom over us and all
States must cooperate to eradicate it. Over the past
year, the 1267 (1999) Committee has made progress
towards reaching its goals, but ultimate success will
depend on the cooperation provided by all States. We
therefore appeal to States that have not yet submitted
national reports to do so without delay.

We hope that the new resolution to replace
resolution 1455 (2003) will improve the sanctions
regime and help to strengthen communications and
fluid contacts between the Committee and all Member
States and relevant organizations, as well as with the
Counter-Terrorism Committee. Similarly, the ongoing
fruitful travels of the Committee Chairman and the
potential establishment of focal points will facilitate
the much-needed exchange of information.
Transparency must remain a key feature of the work of
the Committee and the Monitoring Group or its
successor. Both should act in close cooperation.

In 2004, we begin a new phase designed to give
greater effect to the assets freeze, the travel ban and the
arms embargo imposed on individuals and entities
linked to Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Our accumulated
experience should allow us to refine those measures
and to continue to improve the consolidated list.
