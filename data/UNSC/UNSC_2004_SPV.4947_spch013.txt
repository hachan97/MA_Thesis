Mr. Mufioz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): We regret
the result of this evening's vote. We had hoped for
unanimity within the Security Council on so important
and complex an issue. The Secretary-General's
favourable opinion was a relevant factor in our
decision to vote in favour of the draft resolution
contained in document 5/2004/313. We hope that the
parties in Cyprus understand that once the people of
Cyprus have, freely and in exercise of their
sovereignty, expressed their opinion in next Saturday's
referendums the Security Council will make its proper
contribution towards full implementation of the
relevant aspects of the agreement on a comprehensive
settlement of the Cyprus problem, especially because
there appear to be no differences among members on
substantive issues and because the obstacles seem to
have been technical in nature.

We wish the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish
Cypriots all the best as they take this important and
historic decision.
