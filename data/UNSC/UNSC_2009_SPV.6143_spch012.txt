Mr. Mugoya (Uganda): From the outset, we have
called for a unanimous decision of the Council on this
important matter and have encouraged all parties
concerned to resolve any differences in order to ensure
that there is a United Nations presence on the ground.
Uganda remains convinced that an international
monitoring presence in the region is vital. The situation
in the Mission's area of responsibility has remained
fragile for some time. We have supported and still
support the continued presence of a United Nations
mission to consolidate and build upon the
achievements in peace and security in the region.

We are disappointed by the apparent lack of
progress in reaching a consensus on the draft resolution
before us today, which in essence will lead to the
eventual closure of the United Nations Mission.
Uganda abstained in the voting because it was quite
clear that, whether we voted for or against the draft
resolution, the future of the United Nations Mission
would still be in jeopardy - a scenario that we would
not have wished for. We regret that the curtain will
close on the United Nations Mission, but call on all the
parties in the region to exercise restraint and engage in
confidence-building measures as they seek a lasting
solution to the conflict.

Finally, we commend the United Nations staff,
who have served in the Mission since 1993, for their
tireless efforts in promoting a more stable situation and
their commitment in contributing to peace and security
in the region.
