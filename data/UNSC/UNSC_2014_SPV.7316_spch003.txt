The President: I thank the Secretary-General for
his briefing and for his leadership on the essential role
that the United Nations is playing in the international
effort to address terrorism. We are extremely grateful.

I now give the floor to Ambassador Quinlan in his
capacity as Chair of the Security Council Committee
pursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999) and 1989 (2011),
concerning Al-Qaida and associated individuals and
entities.
