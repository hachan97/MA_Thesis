The President: I am very sorry to interrupt but
I wonder ifI could ask Mr. Madeira to kindly bring
his remarks to a close, as there are two other briefers,
followed by the statements of the Council members.
The Special Representative of the Secretary-General
has requested that the Council then hold consultations.

I give the floor to Mr. Madeira to conclude
his remarks.
