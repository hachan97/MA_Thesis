Mr. Lucas (Angola): We thank the Permanent
Representative of Spain, Ambassador Roman Oyarzun
Marchesi, for the presentation of the revised 90-
day report of the Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1737 (2006). We commend and support the
work of the Committee and the Panel of Experts on an
issue to which the international community attributes
fundamental importance.

We are pleased about the adoption by the Security
Council, on 20 July, ofresolution 2231 (2015) endorsing
the recently concluded Joint Comprehensive Plan of
Action, which was the first success of diplomacy in
the Middle East region in decades and is a landmark
towards a comprehensive and long-lasting solution to
the Iranian nuclear issue. Now, during the transitional
period, we urge the Government of Iran to undertake
specific actions, stipulated in the Joint Comprehensive
Plan of Action, and comply with its provisions in order
to expedite the casing of the sanctions imposed by the
Security Council.

Finally, we remain committed to the measures
imposed by the relevant Security Council resolutions
on these issues towards implementation, taking into
account the exemptions provided for in resolution 2231
(2015).
