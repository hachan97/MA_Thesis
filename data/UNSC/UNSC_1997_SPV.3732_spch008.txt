Mr. Martini Herrera (Guatemala) (interpretation from Spanish): I wish simply to express briefly my
delegation's satisfaction that this moment of historic
importance for Guatemala has come under your
presidency, Sir, and in the presence of the Foreign
Minister of Costa Rica and the Secretary-General, and
that the Security Council has fulfilled its weighty
peacekeeping responsibilities so commendably and to the
great benefit of my country.

I need not repeat the ideas put forward in the
excellent statements in support of the draft resolution
considered at the Council's first meeting of the year, but
I should like once again to express our gratitude for them.
I assure members that the considerations put forward in
those statements are sufficient grounds for the great
satisfaction felt at this moment by the people and the
Government of Guatemala, as we see that the obstacles
that made it impossible for the necessary measures to be
taken to pursue the peace process with United Nations
participation have been overcome.

Therefore, on behalf of my people and Government,
I have the pleasure to convey our satisfaction and
profound gratitude through you, Mr. President, to each
and every member of the Security Council - and in
particular to one whose understanding has earned our
special thanks - as well as to the Secretariat and all the
countries that have striven towards this moment, for the
critical contribution that the Council has just made to the
normalization of the living conditions and to the well-
being of the long-suffering people of Guatemala, who
deserve a better fate than that which the persistence of the
sterile domestic conflict and its attendant suffering
seemed to hold in store.
