Mr. Orrenius Skau (Sweden): Let me begin by
thanking the United Kingdom for taking the initiative
to update the Security Council.

I also thank the High Representative for
Disarmament Affairs, Ms. Izumi Nakamitsu, for her
comprehensive briefing.

Sweden has been clear in condemning in the
strongest terms the attempted murder of individuals
with a nerve agent on British soil. We fully stand by
the common position of the European Union on the
matter. We share the assessment of the Government
of the United Kingdom that it is highly likely that the
Russian Federation is responsible and that there is no
other plausible alternative explanation. We reiterate our
strong solidarity with the United Kingdom, our close
friend and European Union partner, and our support
for its ongoing investigation. We welcome the open and
transparent manner in which the United Kingdom has
approached the matter, including by arranging an open
briefing yesterday for all Member States.

We also welcome the continued cooperation
between the United Kingdom and the Organization
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)
in full compliance with the Chemical Weapons
Convention. We thank the OPCW for its prompt
reaction to the request of the United Kingdom and for
its professionalism. Sweden has full confidence in the
authoritative findings of the OPCW, which confirm the
identity of the toxic chemical. It is a matter of utmost
concern. We reiterate our call on the Russian Federation
to answer questions posed by the United Kingdom. Let
me take this opportunity to underline our full support
to the OPCW, the independent organization tasked with
overseeing the chemical weapons ban.

Once again we condemn in the strongest terms the
use of all chemical weapons, which is repugnant and
strictly prohibited under international law. We must be
vigilant in our efforts to ensure that the integrity of the
chemical weapons ban is respected.
