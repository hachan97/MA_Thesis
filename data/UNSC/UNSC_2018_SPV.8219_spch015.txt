Mr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): We
are grateful for the holding of this emergency meeting
and for the briefing by Mr. Taye-Brook Zerihoun.
Peru is following with deep concern the situation
in Gaza. We deplore and mourn the death of at least
15 Palestinians, and we note that hundreds of others
have been injured. We point out that the violence
continues to increase in the form ofboth parties" violent
rhetoric, and, effectively, Hamas might be interested in
provoking an escalation. Nonetheless, we note that the
unsustainable status quo puts off the need to address the
root causes of the conflict, and that the humanitarian
situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.

We recognize the right ofPalestinians to demonstrate
peacefully based on their freedom of speech and
assembly. We also condemn any attack or attempt to
carry out a terrorist attack, and we acknowledge the right
ofIsrael to legitimately defend itself in accordance with
the principles of proportionality, caution and legality.
In that regard, we condemn the disproportionate use
of force under international law and international
humanitarian law. Moreover, we note that the situation
was not unforeseeable. Several days ago when we meet
with Mr. Mladenov (see S/PV.8214), we expressed our
concern about the risk of an escalation and underscored
the need to protect civilians. Accordingly, we reiterate
the need for the United Nations and those countries
with influence in the region to take urgent measures
so as to prevent further violence and protect civilians.

Lastly, we call all parties to act with restraint,
avoid further escalation and facilitate an environment
of reduced tensions that will enable achieving the two-
State solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
