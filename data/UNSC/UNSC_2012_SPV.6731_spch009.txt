Mr. Wittig (Germany): I would like to warmly
welcome the Prime Minister of Libya and thank him
for his statement. I want to assure him of Germany's
support for his Government and for the Libyan people.

I want to respond to my Russian colleague about
the NATO operations. As is well known, my country
did not participate in the NATO operations undertaken
in implementation of resolution 1973 (2011), but as my
country is a member of NATO, I feel that I have to
respond to my Russian colleague.

The report of the International Commission of
Inquiry of the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/ 19/68)
covers NATO operations. As a member State of NATO,
we took the allegations of civilian casualties very
seriously. NATO fully cooperated with the
International Commission of Inquiry on Libya and
provided a significant amount of information, much of
which had to be declassified to assist the Commission
in its work. The Commission's mandate was to review
war crimes and violations of international humanitarian
law, and its findings are that NATO's operations do not
fall in that category.

I wish to highlight that the Commission has
concluded the NATO "conducted a highly precise
campaign with a demonstrable determination to avoid
civilian casualties" (A/HRC/19/68, summary). The
Commission also recognizes "NATO's objective to take
all necessary precautions to avoid civilian casualties
entirely" (ibid, para. 89). NATO conducted operations
in Libya in full accordance with the United Nations
mandate to protect civilians and civilian-populated
areas from attacks and threats of attacks.
