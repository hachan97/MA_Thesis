The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

At this meeting, the Council will hear a briefing
by the four ambassadors who led the Security Council
mission to Africa: Mr. Dumisani Kumalo, Permanent
Representative of South Africa, and Sir Emyr Jones
Parry, Permanent Representative of the United
Kingdom, who together led the mission to Addis
Ababa, Khartoum and Accra; Mr. Jorge Voto-Bernales,
Permanent Representative of Peru, who led the mission
to Abidjan; and Mr. Jean-Marc de La Sabliere,
Permanent Representative of France, who led the
mission to Kinshasa.

Allow me, before I give the floor to the Heads of
the Security Council mission, to say a few words.

Belgium welcomes the fact that the Security
Council mission to Africa took place during the month
of its presidency. My country, as the Council is aware,
attaches particular importance to the African continent.
Belgium is thus very pleased to note that its interest in
Africa is shared by the Council and is reflected in its
work.

I now give the floor to His Excellency,
Mr. Dumisani Kumalo, who, along with Ambassador
Jones Parry, led the Security Council mission to Addis
Ababa, Khartoum and Accra.
