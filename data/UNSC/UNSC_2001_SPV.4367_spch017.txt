Mr. Chen Xu (China) (spoke in Chinese): We
also welcome the presence of the Secretary-General at
this very important meeting. We thank Under-
Secretary-General Guehenno for his important briefing,
as do the other members of the Council, concerning the
successful holding of elections for the Constituent
Assembly. We wish to express our gratification.

This is a very important step in the independence
process for East Timor. It will also establish solid
foundations for peace, stability, prosperity in East
Timor after independence. We appreciate the efforts
made by the East Timorese leaders and congratulate the
East Timorese people for their participation in the
election and for the spirit they have demonstrated.

We wish to congratulate the elected members of
the Assembly. We appreciate the United Nations
Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET)
under the leadership of Mr. Vieira de Mello for the
great amount of work they have done towards the
successful holding of the elections. We also appreciate
the efforts made by the Government of Indonesia for
the election.

Mr. Guehenno mentioned in his briefing that after
elections there will be a great amount of work to do.
We believe that the members of the Constituent
Assembly will shoulder the responsibilities entrusted to
them and show themselves worthy of the trust placed in
them by the East Timorese people. We call upon the
international community to continue to provide the
necessary assistance to the East Timorese people. The
Chinese delegation supports maintaining a substantial
international presence in East Timor after
independence.

We are looking forward to the Secretary-
General's report due in October, which will outline
concrete recommendations in this area. Finally, we
support the presidential statement to be adopted at the
conclusion of this meeting.
