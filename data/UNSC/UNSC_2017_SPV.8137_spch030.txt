The President: I shall now make some concluding
remarks in my capacity as the Minister of Foreign
Affairs of Japan.

Japan has consistently devoted itself to creating
a free and democratic country, whilel respecting
human rights and abiding by the rule of law, as well
as supporting peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific
region as a peace-loving nation. The path Japan has
walked as a peace-loving nation will not change in
future and will continue contributing to the peace and
prosperity of the world more than ever before.

In our meeting today we have condemned, in
the strongest terms, the acts of provocation by North
Korea in violation of the relevant Security Council
resolutions. We have once again made it clear that the
international community will never accept a nuclear-
armed North Korea. I call on all Member States to fully
implement the relevant Security Council resolutions
and maximize international pressure on North Korea
in order to realize a denuclearized Korean peninsula.

After our presidency this month, Japan will leave
the Security Council. However, we will continue to
cooperate closely with the remaining and incoming
members, as well as with non-members, so that the
North Korean issue will be properly addressed in
the Council.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

The representative of the Republic of Korea has
asked for the floor to make a further statement. I now
give him the floor.
