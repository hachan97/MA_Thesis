Mr. Wehbe (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): In accordance with the position of the Syrian
Arab Republic - which is committed to the
resolutions of international legitimacy - and with the
role of the United Nations and the need to revitalize
that role in response to the humanitarian needs of the
brotherly Iraqi people by restarting the oil for food
programme, and in the light of the fact that the Security
Council adopted this resolution as the first resolution to
address the repercussions of the American-British
invasion of Iraq, the Syrian Arab Republic would like
to stress that it voted in favour of the resolution for
humanitarian purposes, as its sole objective is to
relieve Iraqi citizens' suffering, which has reached new
heights as a result of this war.

Our vote should in no way be construed as an
acceptance of the American-British occupation; it
should be understood as an attempt to continue to work
to put an end to that occupation and to achieve the
withdrawal of the invading forces from the Republic of
Iraq. In addition, our vote should not be interpreted by
any side as granting legitimacy to the invasion. The
resolution's contents - including the references in
operative paragraphs 4 and 5 to the Secretary-General
undertaking certain measures as an urgent first step and
performing additional functions as a second step -
mean only that we are trying to cooperate with the
current Iraqi Government in that urgent work.
