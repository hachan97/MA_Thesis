Mr. Lacroix (France) (spoke in French): France
greatly deplores the fact that since our meeting this
morning the situation has considerably worsened. It is
unacceptable to hear reports of destruction, of
bombings, of general mobilizations and of foreign
interventions. We have a simple message for the
Ossetians, the Georgians and the Russians: there is no
way out through the military option. Nothing can be
gained by a fait accompli policy for either side. Such
an approach is unrealistic because it will only succeed
in opening deep wounds and compromise the only way
out: the peaceful definition of the status of South
Ossetia within the internationally recognized borders
of sovereign Georgia.

Combat must stop immediately. We call on the
parties to resume the path of negotiations without
delay. In this regard, the European Union (EU) is in
close contact with all of the protagonists in the crisis.
Under the French presidency, the EU spare no efforts
to pursue these discussions. It has been decided that
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
envoys as well as envoys from the European Union and
the United States will go to Georgia to attain a
ceasefire as soon as possible. We call upon the parties
to cooperate fully with them to arrive at a lasting
solution.

Finally, the fighting of recent days has dozens of
deaths, hundreds of wounded and thousands of
refugees and displaced persons. Everything possible
must be done to help those who have fled their homes
find shelter, receive care and return quickly to their
homes. We cannot add to the tragic nature of this
fighting by creating a humanitarian tragedy. It is the
responsibility of the Security Council to ensure that
that does not happen.
