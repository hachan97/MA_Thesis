The President (spoke in Spanish): Under rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite
the representative of Spain to participate in this
meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/201l/268, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by France, the Russian
Federation, Spain, the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of
America.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/20ll/249, containing the report of the
Secretary-General on the situation concerning Western
Sahara.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the
voting.
