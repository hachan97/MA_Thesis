Mr. Oyarzun Marchesi (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): I have the honour to present the report of the
Security Council Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1737 (2006), in accordance with paragraph
18 of that resolution. The present report covers the
period from 23 June to 14 September, during which
time the Committee held an informal meeting on
1 September and carried out additional activities, using
the no-objection procedure provided for in paragraph
15 of the guidelines for conducting its work.

I should like to start by welcoming the conclusion
by Iran, the P5+1 and the European Union on 14 July of
the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and to commend
the negotiating parties for their joint efforts to find a
comprehensive, long-term and adequate solution to the
Iranian nuclear issue. I would further like to welcome
the adoption on 20 July of resolution 2231 (2015), by
which the Council endorsed the Joint Comprehensive
Plan of Action, whose conclusion, as affirmed by the
Council in its resolution, marks a fundamental shift in
its consideration of this issue.

I should like to stress the fact that, during the current
transitional period, up until the Security Council's
receipt of the report of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) in which the IAEA confirms that
Iran has taken a set of nuclear-cnergy-related actions
in accordance with the provisions of resolution 2231
(2015), on the day known as Implementation Day, the
measures imposed by the Security Council through
resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007), 1803 (2008) and
1929 (2010) remain in full effect, and Member States
remain under the obligation to apply them strictly and
fully, with due respect for exemptions provided for in
resolution 2231 (2015).

The Committee remains fully committed to the
implementation of all relevant resolutions and stands
ready to provide guidance to those Member States that
request assistance.

In relation to past incidents investigated by the
Panel of Experts, I would recall that the Committee
reached out to the Islamic Republic of Iran for comment
on several occasions. The Islamic Republic of Iran has
not yet provided a response; the Committee continues
to call on it to do so.

The Committee continues to provide States
and international organizations with assistance in
implementing the relevant Security Council measures.
In this regard, the Committee received additional
information in relation to the proposal that an
international organization provide technical assistance
to the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Committee is
continuing its consideration of the proposal and
welcomes such collaboration on issues related to of
implementation and compliance, and it encourages
parties to continue to seek guidance from the Committee
on the application of the Council's measures.

In accordance with paragraph 5 of resolution 1737
(2006), the Committee was notified by one Member
State about the delivery of equipment to be used in
a light-water reactor at the Bushehr nuclear plant.
Similarly, in accordance with paragraph 15 of resolution
1737 (2006) and paragraph 4 of resolution 1747 (2007),
the Committee was notified by one Member State that
it had allowed for payments owed by a designated
entity, under a contract that entered into force prior to
its designation, to be made from that entity's frozen
funds. In addition, one Member State submitted two
reports in accordance with paragraph 17 of resolution
1929 (2010).

With respect to the adoption of resolution 2231
(2015), the Committee is continuing its constructive
dialogue on the steps to be taken in the foreseeable
future. In that connection, the Committee was notified
by one Member State, in accordance with paragraph
22 of resolution 2231 (2015), that it had initiated
preparatory steps in relation to establishing a stable
isotope production centre at the Fordow facility and to
removing stockpiles of Iranian low-and rich uranium in
return for natural uranium.
In view of the actions taken by Member States to
implement the relevant Security Council measures,
the Committee encourages Sstates that have not yet
submitted reports to do so as soon as possible, in
recognition of the fact that national implementation
reports are an important means of promoting the
implementation of sanctions measures.

In connection with the Panel of Experts, I am
pleased to report that, following the Security Council's
decision, contained in resolution 2224 (2015), of9 June
2015, to extend the Panel's mandate until 9 July 2016,
the Secretary-General appointed on 30 June 2015 seven
experts to serve on the Panel.

On 28 August 2015, the Panel submitted its
programme of work for the new mandate in accordance
with paragraph 3 of resolution 2224 (2015). On behalf
of the Committee, I would like to recognize the
continued efforts of the Panel in assisting the work of
the Committee. We look forward to close and fruitful
collaboration with the Panel under its new mandate. As
to the activities undertaken by the Panel over the past
three months, I note that the Panel has participated in
a number of events that are listed in the annex to the
present report.

Finally, while recalling that the primary
responsibility for implementing the provisions of
resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007), 1803 (2008) and
1929 (2010) rests with Member States, the Committee
stands ready to facilitate implementation of these
measures.
