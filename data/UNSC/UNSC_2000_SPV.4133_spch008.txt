Mr. Granovsky (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We join in expressing our thanks to Mr. Annabi
for his very informative briefing containing an important
assessment of the situation in East Timor.

In Russia, together with all of the international
community, we continue to closely follow developments
in and around East Timor. Yes, there are still serious
problems, described in earlier statements. Of course, this
is natural, but the overall stable trend is a positive one.
What is important is that the problems are being
solved - not as quickly as we would like, but
significantly - and stable progress is evident.

One of the most notable achievements recently was
the signing of the two important memorandums that the
representative of Argentina mentioned. We believe that
the Indonesian side, which signed these agreements with
representatives of the United Nations Transitional
Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), confirmed once
again that there is the political will to find a final
settlement of the East Timor problem.

We also consider it important to emphasize that the
successful work of UNTAET is, to a large extent, the
result of able leadership provided by the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sergio
Vieira de Mello.

In conclusion, I should like to express the hope that
the United Nations presence in East Timor will continue
to be as productive as it is today.
