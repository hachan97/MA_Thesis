Mr. Vilovie (Croatia): Croatia also condemned
the conducting of nuclear missile tests by the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We saw it as a
threat to international peace and security and therefore
we supported the unanimous response on the part of
the Security Council.

We call upon the Democratic People's Republic
to return to the framework of the Six-Party Talks and to
revoke its position on withdrawing from the Treaty on
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We look
forward to its possible accession to the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea
should take seriously this message of the Security
Council, which is binding in all aspects. We also
understand that the measures adopted are not aimed at
the general population of the Democratic People's
Republic but should be taken as a tool to encourage its
leaders to take the path of negotiations over
confrontation.
