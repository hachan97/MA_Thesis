The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Sierra Leone, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Davies
(Sierra Leone) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the course of the Council's
prior consultations, I shall take it that the Security
Council agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of
its provisional rules of procedure to Justice Renate
Winter, President of the Special Court for Sierra Leone,
and to Mr. Steven Rapp, Prosecutor of the Special
Court for Sierra Leone.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear
briefings by Justice Renate Winter and Prosecutor
Steven Rapp. I now give the floor to Justice Winter.
