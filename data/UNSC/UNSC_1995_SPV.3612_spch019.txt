Mr. Cardenas (Argentina) (interpretation from Spanish): The delegation of Argentina was a sponsor -
and a deeply committed one, to be sure - of the
important resolution we have just adopted. God willing,
it represents the last chapter of the tragedy that until
recently engulfed the Balkans.

This chapter is doubtless one of reconciliation, but
it is also one of responsibility. All of those who, with a
level of savage brutality that shames the world, revived
genocidal practices, perpetrated "ethnic cleansing",
committed abominable human rights violations or flouted
the norms of humanitarian law will now have to face the
consequences of their behaviour.

All Member States must fully cooperate, with all the
requisite firmness, to ensure that this comes to pass. Only
thus will it be possible, in the Balkans and elsewhere, to
eradicate such terrible actions and true crimes, which
flout the fundamental moral and legal principles on which
the international community bases coexistence. Only thus
will there be justice. Only thus will there be lasting peace.
Finally, should anyone in the future venture to offend the
conscience of humanity and embark on the path of horror,
only thus will he know from the very beginning of his
acts the predictable consequence of his behaviour: sooner
or later, he will have to face justice.

Lastly, I refer to the letter of 18 December 1995 that
we all received from the representative of the former
Yugoslavia concerning the conduct of some Bosnian
Serbs. That letter is unacceptable because it is inspired by
a spirit diametrically opposed to that of the resolution we
have unanimously adopted today. Hence, we do not
hesitate to call it shameful.
