Mr. Zhang Dianbin (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution
2352 (2017), renewing the mandate of the United
Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA).
The resolution embodies the will of the Council,
while taking into account the concerns of the affected
countries and the troop-contributing countries,
including Ethiopia.

Thanks to the joint efforts made by the Sudan and
South Sudan, alongside the international community,
the situation in Abyei remains calm in general, but
challenges remain to its political and security situation.
UNISFA's ongoing active implementation of its mandate
will be conducive to the maintenance of regional peace
and stability.

China hopes that the resolution will be earnestly
and effectively implemented. We encourage the Sudan
and South Sudan to continue to engage in dialogue;
steadily build trust and confidence, keeping in mind
the larger picture of the interests of all ethnicities and
communities in the region; effectively advance the
implementation of the relevant bilateral agreements;
and establish and operationalize interim adminstrative
and judicial institutions at an early date.

China will continue to support UNISFA in
implementing its mandate, and stands ready to play a
constructive role in achieving peace and stability at an
early date in the Abyei area.
