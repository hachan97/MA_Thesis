Mr. Powles (New Zealand): New Zealand welcomes
the draft resolution by which the Council would establish
a United Nations Transitional Administration in East
Timor (UNTAET). This marks a significant step forward
on East Timor's road to independence, the option that the
overwhelming majority of East Timorese voters chose in
the popular consultation conducted by the United Nations
on 30 August.

New Zealand is committed to assisting the United
Nations in this important task. A sizeable part of that
commitment is the substantial contribution of New
Zealand Defence Force personnel to the multinational
Force - the International Force, East Timor

 

(INTERFET) - which was mandated by the Security
Council under resolution 1264 (1999). As we have
informed the Secretary-General, this contribution will be
made available to the military component of the United
Nations Transitional Administration to be authorized today.
The New Zealand Government is of the View that the
replacement of the multinational force by a United Nations
peacekeeping force within the United Nations Transitional
Administration should proceed without delay once the draft
resolution has been adopted.

The reasons, symbolic and practical, for the
replacement of the multinational force by the United
Nations force as soon as possible, as was originally
envisaged when resolution 1264 (1999) was adopted and
which is now provided for by the draft resolution
establishing UNTAET, are compelling. New Zealand
considers in particular that the establishment of the United
Nations peacekeeping force will enhance the security of the
operation and allow for the burden-sharing that should
rightly lie at the heart of United Nations collective security
measures.
