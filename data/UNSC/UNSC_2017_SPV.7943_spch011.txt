Mr. Llorentty Soliz (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): Bolivia takes note
of the report (S/2017/379,annex) presented by the
High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Mr. Valentin Inzko.

Once again, Bolivia reaffirms its full support for
the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence
of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in
accordance with the principles of the Charter of the
United Nations. We call upon all parties to support and
implement the Dayton Peace Accords as the legal basis
that could pave the way for stability and the peaceful
settlement of differences between the parties, with a
view to achieving lasting peace.

We also take note ofthe work oingh Representative
Inzko and we encourage him to continue his efforts
in fulfilling his mandate, according to principles of
transparency and impartiality, through an inclusive
dialogue that takes into account the approaches and
opinions of all actors involved, in accordance with the
Dayton Peace Accords.

In that regard, Bolivia urges the parties to continue
to work for the good of their country and the welfare of
its constituent peoples, who control their own future and
are fully sovereign in their decisions. We call on them
to continue their joint efforts to foster dialogue and the
peaceful settlement of disputes, in order to advance
respect for human rights, cooperation and economic
and social development. Similarly, we also encourage
the parties to step up their efforts in the implementation
of the 5+2 agenda, as a requirement for the closure of
the Office of the High Representative.

Finally, given the complex situation in the region,
we would like to urge the international community to
pay attention to the concerns of all parties involved,
with a neutral and equitable approach to avoid repeating
errors ofthe past, while supporting and encouraging the
development and well-being of this brotherly country.
