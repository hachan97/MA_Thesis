Prince Zeid Ra'ad Zeid Al-Hussein (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): Jordan welcomes the Council's
unanimous adoption of resolution 2165 (2014). We are
proud to have been one of the sponsors and drafters of
the resolution, along with Australia and Luxembourg.
We negotiated the text of the draft resolution with the
other members of the Council, trying our best to come
up with the highest degree of consensus thereon. In
that regard, we would like thank all members of the
Council - permanent and elected - for their good
intentions and profound understanding of the goals and
motives of the text. We appreciate the unified position
taken by the Council.

The resolution is a response to the non-compliance
of Syrian parties, particularly the Syrian authorities,
with resolution 2139 (2014). That non-compliance has
been confirmed in the past four reports ofthe Secretary-
General, in which he has stated that the humanitarian
situation in Syria has deterioriated further and that
humanitarian assistance has been on the decline.

The resolution is an operational text and should
be read in concert with resolution 2139 (2014). It is
designed to guarantee the delivery of humanitarian
assistance to all those in need, wherever they are in
Syria and through the most direct routes, without delay
or discrimination. In that regard, I note that, along with
sponsors Australia and Luxembourg, we have been in
constant contact and coordination with the Office for
the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, headed by
Under-Secretary-General Valerie Amos, and her team
dealing with the Syrian dossier, with a view to arriving
at the most efficient means to extend humanitarian
assistance on the ground.

In conclusion, Jordan hopes that the Council will
take measures against any Syrian that does not abide by
resolutions 2139 (2014) and 2165 (2014), adopted today.
