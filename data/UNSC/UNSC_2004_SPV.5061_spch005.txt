The President: I shall now make a statement in
my capacity as the representative of the United
Kingdom.

The United Kingdom welcomes the adoption of
this resolution. The text rightly reflects the changing
situation on the ground, which is in no small part due
to the work of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force
in Cyprus (UNFICYP), as well as the offices of the
Secretary-General and his good offices team. We also
recognize the part played by the guarantor Powers and
the parties on the island.

The resolution provides for the implementation of
the Secretary-General's recommendations for the
downsizing and reconfiguration of UNFICYP and also
provides for a further comprehensive review before the
next mandate. The resolution focuses only on the
narrow issue of the future of UNFICYP. There is, of
course, the wider question of the future of the
settlement process. The Secretary-General has
produced a good report, which the United Kingdom
fully supports.

The Council will need to come back to the
continuing search for a settlement, in the light of
developments. We are disappointed that, having voted
for a settlement in April, Turkish Cypriots have so far
seen little benefit. We remain committed to ending the
isolation of the Turkish Cypriots and to reducing the
economic gap between the two communities. We
believe this to be a key element of keeping alive the
prospect of a reunification.

I now resume my function as President of the
Council.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 1.30 p.m.
