The President: My apologies for my short
absence. Can I perhaps now ask principal speakers who
opened this afternoon's session if they would like to
make any brief responses to the comments which have
been made? There were some direct questions to Sir
Kieran, so I will ask him to start, and then I move on to
Mr. Mar Dieye and then to General Diarra.
