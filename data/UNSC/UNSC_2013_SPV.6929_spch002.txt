Mr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish):
Guatemala voted in favour of resolution 2093 (2013)
given the importance of supporting the efforts of
the Government of Somalia, the United Nations and
the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM).
Thanks to such collective efforts, Somalia now has
new prospects. Similarly, we support the extension of
AMISOM's mandate until 28 February 2014. We think
that the resolution just adopted provides for an orderly
process of integration and strengthening of the United
Nations presence in Somalia.

We also acknowledge the significant progress made
in stabilizing and pacifying the country, or at least parts
of it, including its main urban centre. However, we wish
to place on record that we believe that the progress made
does not yet justify the lifting of the arms embargo
alluded to in paragraph 33 of the resolution. We believe
that the Security Council should have adopted a phased
approach in order to prevent the possible repercussions of
a sudden suspension of the embargo from subsequently
jeopardizing the stabilization efforts in Somalia. That
is another way of saying that our delegation supported
the recommendations of the Somalia and Eritrea
Monitoring Group on the issue. They provided Somalia
the ability to develop its security sector without having
to modifying the arms embargo.

We trust that, with the adoption of this resolution, the
international community will redouble its commitment
to accelerating security sector reform in Somalia and
will support it in establishing the necessary safeguards
for an already operational system that ensures adequate
arms control.
