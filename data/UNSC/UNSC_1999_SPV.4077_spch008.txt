Mr. van Walsum (Netherlands): Under normal
circumstances we, too, would have been glad to support
a regular roll-over for a new phase of 180 days. However,
we believe that the circumstances are not normal.

The Netherlands was a sponsor of one of the three
draft resolutions that were informally submitted after the
panel's exercise. At a certain point it was decided to
entrust the issue to the five permanent members. We were
able to accept this procedure because we felt that the
permanent five members constituted the only institution
that would be capable of hammering out a consensus.
That was about half a year ago. Now the permanent five
are under pressure from the elected members, and rightly
so.

Given the circumstances, we believe that a one-week
extension of phase VI maintains that pressure. A longer
extension would, in our view, remove the pressure, and
we are strongly in favour of maintaining this pressure
because we hope that the permanent five members will
interpret the signal correctly and bring the comprehensive
resolution back to the Council before 11 December.

In this matter perhaps too much has already been
said about the distinction between the permanent five and
the elected ten, and I am reluctant to raise this issue once
again. But I would like to point out that, in my view, an
elected member could not afford not to take part in the
vote on such an important issue as oil-for-food. We
would never be able to explain such behaviour to the
delegations that elected us.
