Mr. Arancibia Fernandez (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): I should like at the
outset, on behalf of the Plurinational State of Bolivia,
to offer our most sincere condolences to the bereaved
family, the Mission of the Russian Federation, the
Government and the people of Russia on the passing of
Ambassador Vitaly Churkin, who was a great exponent
of global diplomacy.

The Bolivian Mission to the United Nations regrets
the loss of one of the most brilliant Ambassadors in
our forum - a fervent defender of multilateralism
who always managed to build bridges for dialogue
and agreement between diverging positions, thereby
resolving the most difficult issues, as with the ceasefire
agreement in Syria, which was a milestone that would
not have been possible without Ambassador Churkin's
work and commitment to peace. His principled position
was also apparent in other situations, such as that in
Palestine and his opposition to neocolonialism.

Lastly, on behalf of Ambassador Llorentty Soliz,
who is travelling and therefore not able to attend today's
meeting, I extend our most sincere condolences to the
family of Ambassador Churkin. Ambassador Llorentty
Soliz considered him a brilliant colleague and a close,
beloved friend. We appreciated his eloquent speeches,
which contributed greatly to the debates held in this
Chamber. May his soul rest in peace.
