Mr. Khalilzad (United States of America): The
representative of the Sudan mentioned the abduction of
the Chinese workers. The United States condemns that
abduction, which took place in South Kordofan state
last week, as articulated in the 21 October press
statement of the Department of State. The United
States is aware of reports that five Chinese workers
were killed during a rescue attempt in South Kordofan
State. If those reports are confirmed, we would express
our regret for those deaths, extend our sympathy to the
victims' families and encourage the Government of the
Sudan and the United Nations Mission in the Sudan to
investigate that incident expeditiously, so that the
perpetrators can be formally identified and brought to
justice.

The United States reiterates its condemnation of
all violence in the Sudan - violence by the
Government and violence by the rebels. All parties
must refrain from violence in favour of peace and
dialogue. In that regard, the Government of the Sudan
has a special responsibility. It must cease to engage in
those areas of concern documented in the most recent
report of the Panel of Experts on the Sudan, including
violating the limited arms embargo on Darfur, using
aircraft painted to resemble United Nations
humanitarian aircraft, conducting offensive overflights
in Darfur, failing to implement the sanctions mandated
by the Security Council and not accepting that there is
no impunity for war crimes and crimes against
humanity.
