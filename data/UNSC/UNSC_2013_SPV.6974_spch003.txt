The President: I thank Prosecutor Bensouda for
her briefing.

In accordance with paragraph 29 of presidential
note S/2010/507 of July 2010, I encourage both Council
and non-Council members to keep their statements to
less than five minutes. I shall be closely monitoring this
aspect of the Council's working methods during this
month. I shall now give the floor to the members of the
Security Council.
