Mr. Barros Melet (Chile) (spoke in Spanish):
We would like to thank Ambassador Roman Oyarzun
Marchesi for introducing the 90-day report of the work
of the Committee established pursuant to resolution
1737 (2006). We appreciate Spain's approach in
presiding over the Security Council's non-proliferation
committees, through which it has shown decisiveness
and political tact.

As noted by Ambassador Oyarzun Marchesi in his
briefing, the sanctions imposed by the Security Council
under resolution 1737 (2006) and the other relevant
resolutions remain in full effect during the course of
the current negotiations between the P5+1 and Iran.
However, sanctions are not an end in themselves, but are
merely a tool used within a broader diplomatic strategy
aimed at restoring the trust between the international
community and Iran with regard to the country's the
nuclear programme.

It is essential to maintain the positive atmosphere
that has prevailed throughout the negotiations. Council
members must contribute to this cause, as it is in
everyone's interest to achieve a broad and substantive
agreement that allows Iran to develop nuclear energy for
peaceful purposes, and the international community to
verify that the programme is not for military purposes.

Chile takes note of the 19 February report of the
Director General of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA). We appreciate the support provided by
the IAEA to the activities of monitoring and verifying
the voluntary measures referred to in the Joint Plan of
Action.

Finally, we thank the Panel of Experts for the work
it is doing, which is vital to the functioning of the
1737 Committee.
