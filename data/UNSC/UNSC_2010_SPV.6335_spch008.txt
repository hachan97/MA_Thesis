Mr. Rugunda (Uganda): Uganda voted in favour
of resolution 1929 (2010) because we fully support the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
(NPT). The resolution has a mechanism for review,
including the suspension and removal of the measures
imposed, provided that Iran complies with its
obligations and the NPT. It is important that all nuclear
activities of State parties to the NPT be verified for
their compliance with the safeguards of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

The Agency has raised a number of issues in its
reports regarding the Iranian nuclear programme that
require clarification by Iran so as to assure the

international community that its nuclear programme is
for peaceful purposes. Uganda commends and supports
the diplomatic efforts of Brazil and Turkey that
resulted in the Tehran declaration. We are convinced
that such confidence-building initiatives are useful in
the search for a peaceful solution to the Iranian nuclear
issue.

Uganda reiterates that it is important to continue
all efforts towards a negotiated solution that guarantees
Iran's inalienable right to develop its nuclear energy,
while at the same time assuring the international
community that its programme is exclusively for
peaceful purposes.
