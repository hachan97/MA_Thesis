Mr. Ndong Mba (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in Spanish): The truth is, we are partially satisfied
with the adoption of resolution 2491 (2019), above all
because we believe that the monitoring of operations in
Libya should be similar to those conducted in the Gulf
of Aden, given the statistics on the loss oflives and the
atrocities committed against migrants who fall victim
to illicit trafficking in persons, murder and gruesome
organ harvesting. We are well aware of the origins and
causes of those practices but we do know how to end
to them. Over the next 12 months, every effort must
be made to improve monitoring operations so that they
are more effective and to do our utmost to put an end
to the pernicious practices to which migrants in Libya
are subjected. To that end, and in order to ensure the
greater effectiveness of monitoring operations, naval
assets should be redeployed as soon as possible.

I would like to take this opportunity to point out
the need for the African Union to become officially
involved in the efforts to find a solution to the very
serious crisis that Libya has been going through since
2011. On 27 September the African Union Peace and
Security Council issued a communique on the decision
by the African Union High-Level Committee on Libya
proposing the designation of a joint United Nations-
African Union envoy for Libya, and requested that
the Security Council take the necessary measures to
consider it. We therefore voted in favour of resolution
2491 (2019) so that over the course ofthe next 12 months
a solution can be found to the causes of this crisis
that can ultimately put an end to migrants' suffering
and martyrdom.
