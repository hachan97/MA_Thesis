Mr. Tenya (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): Peru voted
in favour of resolution 2451 (2018), sponsored by the
United Kingdom, because we believe it is necessary
for the Council to support the important agreements
reached in Sweden by the parties to the Yemeni
conflict and to help facilitate the implementation and
monitoring ofthe agreement, in close coordination with
the Secretary-General and his Special Envoy. We thank
the United Kingdom for its efforts to achieve consensus.

At the same time, we believe that the Council has
a clear responsibility to meet the urgent needs of a
population facing the worst humanitarian crisis in the
world today, in particular in the light of the fact that the
looming threat of famine is a result of the conflict. We
note that the resolution contains specific reference to
the need to investigate and ensure access to justice and
accountability for the atrocity crimes that have been
committed in the conflict in Yemen. We also express
our gratitude to and support for the work of Secretary-
General Antonio Guterres, his Special Envoy Martin
Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian
Affairs Mark Lowcock and all humanitarian workers
deployed in Yemen.
Furthermore, we highlight the role played by
Sweden and all countries that have made it possible
for the parties to arrive at a ceasefire, pursuant to the
Stockholm agreement. We believe that, following the
Stockholm meeting, we are taking a step forward today
towards ending the conflict and alleviating the suffering
in Yemen. However, we must recognize that we have a
long way to go to achieve sustainable peace, which will
need the support of the international community and
the Council.
