Mr. Shen Bo (China) (spoke in Chinese): We
listened carefully to the briefing by Ms. Bensouda.

Thanks to the efforts of the people of Libya,
important progress has been made in the country's
political transition. We hope that the people of Libya
will work to achieve national cohesion and State unity,
continue to move its political process forward, and
tackle the many challenges it faces in order to achieve
early national reconciliation, social stability and
national economic reconstruction. The international
community is called upon to continue to provide
support and assistance to the Government and the
people of Libya in their efforts.

China's position on the question of the International
Criminal Court remains unchanged. We support the
Government of Libya in its efforts to strengthen the rule
of law, establish a sound judicial system, investigate
and punish serious crimes. We also hope that the
International Criminal Court, in its activities carried
out under the relevant Security Council resolutions, will
play a positive role in Libya's national reconstruction
and political transition.
