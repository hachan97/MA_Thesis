The President (spoke in French): I call now on
Justice King to respond to comments made.

Justice King: At this stage, I want merely to say
that we are very grateful to those present here this
afternoon who have participated very seriously in this
debate. As President of the Special Court, I am very
encouraged by the participation and the contributions
of the States whose representatives have attended this
debate. I think the message is that there will be
cooperation and that the Special Court will be able to
complete its mandate. It has not been easy; yet I know
that, with the cooperation of the international
community, the Special Court will succeed in its
experiment.

I want finally, Mr. President, to thank you, to
thank the Deputy Secretary-General, and to thank all
those representatives who have sacrificed their time to
be here this afternoon and participate in this debate.

The President (spoke in French): I thank Justice
King for his kind words.

I call now on Mr. Rapp to respond to comments
and questions raised.
