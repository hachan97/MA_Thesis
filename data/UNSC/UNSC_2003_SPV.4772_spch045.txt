Mr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Russian): I wish to
congratulate you, Sir, on your national holiday.

(spoke in Spanish)

First of all, I would like to say that Spain, as a
member State of the European Union, supports the
statement made by the Permanent Representative of
Greece.

Spain has unreservedly supported the
International Criminal Court. In the matter under
discussion, we consider that article 16 of the Rome
Statute is mentioned in the resolution adopted today in
accordance with the Statute. As a result, we understand
that the renewal of the provision in paragraph 1 of
resolution 1422 (2002) does not affect the integrity of
the Statute.

Lastly, I would like to add that from our point of
View, it should not be taken for granted that invoking
article 16 will become a regular practice. It is clear that
in every case the Council will have to study the
circumstances that prevail at the time, which could
vary in the future. For this reason, Spain considers that
the Council is still the master when considering
whether to renew or not, as necessary, without
renewals being automatic, in accordance with the
resolution.
