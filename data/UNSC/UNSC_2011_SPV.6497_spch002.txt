Mr. De Mistura: I should like to make a special
request. This is the tenth year of heavy engagement of
many States Members of the United Nations in
Afghanistan. In a few days, President Karzai shall
formally announce areas that will be transferred to
Afghan ownership through the transition. It is therefore
time, with the Council's permission, to pay special
attention to the desire of the Afghan authorities for
2

national sovereignty and to mark it symbolically by
asking all participants in this meeting to facilitate,
assess and promote the transition to full ownership and
leadership by the Afghans. I know this is slightly
irregular but I believe it to be an important symbol, and
I should like to make a special request to you, Sir, and
the members of the Security Council for my friend
Ambassador Tanin to speak before me.
