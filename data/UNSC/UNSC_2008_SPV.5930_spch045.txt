Mr. Holmes: I shall be very brief. I think
understandably, most delegations focused their remarks
on the major political and security challenges in
Afghanistan and less so on the humanitarian situation,
but I am grateful to those delegations that referred to
the need to increase the humanitarian assistance we can
give to the people of Afghanistan and to the need to
strengthen our efforts with the Government of
Afghanistan to reinforce our humanitarian capacity.

I am grateful for that support. Let me assure the
Council that we will be doing our best for our part, that
is as the international humanitarian community, to
strengthen that capacity and to try to respond better to
these humanitarian needs, which are unfortunately
increasing at this time.
