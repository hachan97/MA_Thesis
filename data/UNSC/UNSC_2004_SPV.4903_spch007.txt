The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Ms. McAskie for her briefing.

I now give the floor to members of the Council. I
should like to reiterate that speakers should strive to
limit their statements to five minutes so that we can
hear all those on the list, and that those who have more
extensive statements should circulate the texts in
writing.
