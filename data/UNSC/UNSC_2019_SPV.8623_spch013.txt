Mr. Pecsteen de Buytswerve (Belgium) (spoke in French): We fully subscribe to the statement made
by the representative of Germany on behalf of the
three penholders. Let me to make a few remarks in my
national capacity.

First, we deeply regret the fact that certain
members of the Council were not able to support draft
resolution S/2019/ 756, on the humanitarian situation
in north-western Syria, which we proposed. From
the beginning, the three co-penholders worked in
a transparent and constructive manner. We did our
utmost to bring together the different positions up to
the last day of negotiations.

For us, the protection of human lives should be at
the heart of any resolution on Idlib. By not achieving
consensus on the draft text, whose purpose is purely
humanitarian, the Council has unfortunately failed the
people of Idlib.

Belgium remains resolutely determined to combat
terrorism. That is the collective will of the Council
but, for us, one thing is clear: counter-terrorism
operations do not absolve the parties to a conflict of
their obligations under international humanitarian
law. The parties must respect the norms applicable
to armed conflict and the principles of distinction,
proportionality and precaution. Bombing civilians,
schools and hospitals has nothing to do with fighting
terrorism. To the contrary, all it does is to create fertile
ground for more terrorism.
