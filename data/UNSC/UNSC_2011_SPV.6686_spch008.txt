Mr. Moungara Moussotsi (Gabon) (spoke in French): On behalf of His Excellency Mr. Nelson
Messone, Permanent Representative of Gabon to the
United Nations, 1 have the honour of reading out the
report of the Chairman of the Committee established
pursuant to resolution 1636 (2005) concerning
Lebanon.

"In accordance with its mandate, the 1636
Committee is tasked with registering as subject to
the travel ban and assets freeze imposed under
paragraph 3(a) of the resolution individuals
designated by the International Independent
Investigation Commission or the Government of
Lebanon as suspected of involvement in the
14 February 2005 terrorist bombing in Beirut that
killed former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq
Hariri and 22 others. Also in resolution 1636
(2005), the Council decided that the Committee
should approve exceptions to the travel ban and
assets freeze on a case-by-case basis, register the
removal of individuals from the scope of the
travel ban and assets freeze measures in
accordance with the resolution, and inform all
Member States as to which individuals are
subject to those measures.

"On 1 January 2010, when Gabon took over
as Chair of the Committee, no individuals had
been registered. Similarly, during Gabon's
chairmanship the Committee held no meetings
and listed no individuals as subject to the
measures imposed under paragraph 3(a) of
resolution 1636 (2005). We believe that the
administration of justice in the Hariri affair will
be an important element of peacebuilding in
Lebanon, which is why we are of the view that
with the successful transfer of confidential
information on this subject between the
International Independent Investigation
Commission and the Special Tribunal for
Lebanon, the 1636 Committee will undoubtedly
be called on to play a more prominent role in the
future, particularly given the developments in the
investigation and judicial proceedings relating to
the 14 February 2005 terrorist attack."
