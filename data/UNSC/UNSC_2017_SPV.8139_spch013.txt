Mr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): Today, the delegation
of Ukraine voted in favour of the draft resolution
(S/2017/1060) proposed by Egypt on the status of
Jerusalem. We are convinced that the issue of Jerusalem
is a final-status issue, which should be resolved only
through negotiations and in strict compliance with
the relevant Security Council resolutions, including
resolutions 476 (1980), 478 (1980) and 2334 (2016).
The draft resolution also reaffirms the inadmissibility
of the acquisition of territory by force. Ukraine knows
only too well the consequences of the violation of
that principle.

We are strongly convinced that there is no other
viable alternative to the two-State solution. We urge
both sides to engage in a constructive negotiation
process with goodwill and with no preconditions. Given
the highly sensitive nature of the issue of Jerusalem for
all sides involved, we hope that the current escalation
can be contained and that it will not get out of control.

Finally, I would like to add my delegation's voice
to the procedural point raised by my colleague from
Uruguay. I urge the remaining and incoming members of
the Council to take that point into serious consideration.
