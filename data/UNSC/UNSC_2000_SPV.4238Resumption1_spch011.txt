The President: I thank the representative of
Malaysia for his kind words and for reminding us of
the debate two weeks ago on the theme of "no exit
without strategy". Indeed, it is our view that all these
issues are linked and connected and that, unless we in
the international community make up strategies that are
holistic, we will not succeed. I think that it is indeed
important to realize these linkages every time we
discuss any of these issues.
