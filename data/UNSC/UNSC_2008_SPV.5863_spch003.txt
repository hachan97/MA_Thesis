Mr. Rogachev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I would like to thank Mr. Bellemare for his
briefing.

I would like to receive, for the first time,
information on a number of elements of the big picture
of the investigation of the killing of the former Prime
Minister of Lebanon, Rafiq Hariri, and the fate of the
08-29745
former Director General of General Security in
Lebanon, General Jamil Al Sayed, and the three other
former heads of the Lebanese Special Services
suspected of being part of the assassination of Prime
Minister Hariri.

Do we correctly understand that these four people
have been in prison for almost three years now, with no
indictment and that they have been detained on the
recommendation of the first head of the Commission?
And that this recommendation in considered to still be
in force?
