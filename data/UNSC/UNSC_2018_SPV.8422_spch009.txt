Mr. Skoog (Sweden): The Central African Republic
is now taking important steps to advance the peace
process under the African Union-led African Initiative
for Peace and Reconciliation in the Central African
Republic. In parallel, its national security forces are
improving their capabilities in spite of the very volatile
and fragile situation in the country, as the recent attacks
on civilians in Alindao and Batangafo demonstrated. I
want to emphasize the critical role played by the United
Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization
Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA)
in securing stability and advancing the peace process,
as well as in supporting the protection of civilians
and fighting sexual and gender-based violence. We
would like to thank France for its work on resolution
2248 (2018). I want to briefly highlight three specific
areas where the mandate of MINUSCA has been
strengthened.

The first is the protection of civilians, including
prevention and early warning. The second is MINUSCA's
political role in supporting the peace process, and the
third is MINUSCA's ability to provide logistical and
technical support to the Central African armed forces.
I also want to emphasize that the resolution recognizes
the adverse effects of climate change on the stability
of the Central African region and stresses the need for
adequate risk assessments and long-term strategies by
the United Nations and Governments of the region. The
mandate was not adopted by consensus, but we urge
all Council members to unite in their support to the
Central African Republic and to MINUSCA, and we
know that they will.
