Mrs. Kawar (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): I should like
to first thank the Permanent Representative of Australia
for his remarkable efforts at the helm of the Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1737 (2006). I should
also like to thank the Panel of Experts for drafting
excellent reports replete with independent information.
We welcome the extension of the mandate of the Panel
of Experts and call for an inquiry into the violations
committed during the previous reporting period. We
should also see continued commitment to working with
the Iranian Government to obtain clarifications on the
violations that have been committed.

Many States Members of the United Nations have
not yet submitted their reports on the measures they
have taken to implement the relevant resolutions of
the Security Council. We should underscore that the
success of the work of the Committee depends on those
reports. Member States must submit them. We urge the
countries in question to submit the reports as quickly
as possible in order to facilitate the work of the Panel of
Experts and the Committee.

Regarding the final report of the Panel of Experts
(S/20l4/394, annex), Jordan calls on the Committee
to continue its deliberations on this matter, bearing in
mind all the recommendations of the Panel of Experts,
and likewise address the matter of companies producing
dual-use technology or items. Those concerned should
be encouraged to keep the Committee and the Panel
of Experts informed regarding those who are not
supporting such efforts.

We would also like to express our support for the
E3+3 negotiations. We encourage the Committee to
continue with the mission that it was charged with and
continue with its efforts in order to find a solution that
is compatible with Security Council resolutions.
