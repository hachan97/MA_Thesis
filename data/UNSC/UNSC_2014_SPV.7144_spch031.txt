Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I have a feeling that there is something in our
proposal that our French colleague does not like. That
is the impression I am left with. But we did not submit
it as a draft resolution of the Security Council. It was
discussed by Secretary of State Kerry and Minister
Lavrov in great detail. They tabled their documents;
we tabled ours. What is unusual about any of this? I
do not see anything unusual in all of this, and if there
is something that he does not like, let us sit down and
discuss the specific points that you do not like. That is
standard diplomatic process.
