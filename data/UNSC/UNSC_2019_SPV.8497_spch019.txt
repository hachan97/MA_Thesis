The President (spoke in French): Before giving
the floor to His Excellency Mr. Soumeylou Boubeye
Maiga, I would like to add an additional comment to
my initial statement. Since we have also talked about
the role of women in the new Government structures of
Mali, I would like to welcome the Minister for Foreign
Affairs, Ms. Kamissa Camara.

I now give the floor to the Prime Minister of Mali.
