Mr. Kuchinsky (Ukraine): I would like to thank
through you, Madam President, Under-Secretary-
General Kenzo Oshima for his succinct yet informative
briefing on the status of implementation of the
initiatives set out in the letter of the President of the
Council of2l June 2001.

Without repeating our position on the topic of
civilians in armed conflict - I think that yesterday's
debate covered many of the issues pertaining to this
important problem in general - I wish to ask
Mr. Oshima a few questions.

First, we would appreciate it if Mr. Oshima could
provide us with an update on the issue of the
development of a manual of best practices for
engagement with armed groups. We should recognize
that when it comes to non-State actors and the problem
of their engagement in a dialogue, there is probably no
satisfactory solution at the moment, especially in
situations where armed groups operate not as an
organized military force with clear political objectives,
but rather as gangs of criminals profiting from the lack
of security and general instability. As far as I know, an
effort has already been made to address this issue in
some form or another. What, in fact, has been done in
this regard by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee?

My second question concerns the identification of
armed elements and their separation from civilians in
refugee camps and camps for internally displaced
persons. I recognize that perhaps this question would
be better addressed to the Office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees or the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations. Still, I would like to know if
you have some information and if you could tell us
whether anything is being done in this direction, and
whether there have been criteria or procedures
developed and applied for this purpose.
