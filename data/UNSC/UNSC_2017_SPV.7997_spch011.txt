Mr. Cardi (Italy): Italy welcomes the outcome of
today's voting. It testifies once again to the unanimous
support of the Security Council to the peace process
in Colombia. Italy would like to praise the parties for
confirming, with the completion of the laying down
of arms and the start of the reintegration process, that
firm commitment and strong leadership are key to
the peaceful solution of conflicts. Also, we commend
the Security Council for showing its responsiveness
and capacity to take a unified, timely and context-
specific action.

Allow me to underline that peace is a process,
irreversible in this case, thanks to the strong resolve
of President Santos Calderon and of the Fuerzas
Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, but still
present challenges that must not be overlooked. We
especially commend in this respect the Government of
Colombia for its efforts in delivering security, services
and economic opportunities to the entire population
across the country. We also commend the Government
for the steps undertaken to curb illegal activities and
organized crime, and will continue to offer bilateral
cooperation to that end and also in the framework of
the European Union.

I would like to conclude by underscoring that the
role played by the United Nations in Colombia and
by the Council is setting an example of flexibility,
effectiveness and respect of the ownership of the
parties. The Council will continue to assist the peace
process in line with the principle guiding ourjoint effort
to strengthen the United Nations as, first and foremost,
a facilitator and a builder of peace. Italy will continue
to support the Security Council action in this direction.
