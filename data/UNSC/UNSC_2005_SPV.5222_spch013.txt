Mr. De La Sabliere (France) (spoke in French):
As this is the first discussion in the Council this month,
I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your
assumption of the presidency of the Council and to
assure you of the full support and cooperation of my
delegation. I would also like to thank Mr. Danilo Turk
for his briefing.

It is always a pleasant task to talk about a mission
that is coming to a successful conclusion, and I believe
that we are all pleased to be able to do that today. We
welcome the holding, from 20 May to 9 June, of the
first general elections in Bougainville - an expression
of the will of the people of Bougainville that marks a
historic turning point in the peace process and opens
the door to a new phase in the implementation of the
Peace Agreement.

We congratulate Papua New Guinea and the
Bougainville parties, which have undertaken to fully
implement the Peace Agreement. We would also like to
say how much we appreciate the contribution of the
countries of the region to the process. We also
commend the vital contribution of the United Nations
Observer Mission in Bougainville. That Mission,
whose mandate expired on 30 June, made it possible
for the momentum of the peace process to be
maintained and represents a success for United Nations
peacebuilding efforts. Clearly, there are lessons to be
drawn from that success.

Following the election of the Autonomous
Bougainville Government, there is a need to
consolidate the gains made and to begin reconstruction
efforts. We must ensure good coordination of the
efforts of United Nations agencies, including the
United Nations Development Programme and UNICEF,
and of bilateral actors, in the promotion of
peacebuilding efforts. We must continue to ensure that
the post-crisis process continues successfully in the
region.
