Mr. Adamia (Georgia): Let me express deep
concern over the current situation in Iraq, in particular
its humanitarian implications. We are saddened that the
coalition was compelled to use force as a last resort to
address the Iraqi regime's non-compliance, for over 12
years, with the demands of Security Council
resolutions and the resulting serious consequences,
including those of a humanitarian nature. This is yet
another example of the consequences that could be
brought about by the practice of ignoring Security
Council resolutions aimed at maintaining regional or
international peace and security.

Today we are confronted with a humanitarian
situation in Iraq that could escalate into a large-scale
crisis. In the present circumstances, with the Security
Council having tested the mechanism of oil for food to
address the humanitarian issues in Iraq, the current
humanitarian crisis has no justification.

Notwithstanding differences in political
approaches of the Security Council members, the
emerging situation in Iraq requires the Security Council
to display resolve, in particular, to endorse the
proposals presented by the Secretary-General and
thereby relieve the suffering of millions of Iraqis.

The Security Council is well able to employ this
kind of effective mechanism. In order to meet these
needs, we believe that the Secretary-General should be
provided with sufficient authority and flexibility to use
existing resources and to assemble new resources. The
Iraqi people should know that the international
community is ready to take far-reaching steps in this
respect.

At the same time, along with many other States,
Georgia considers it vital to see the effectiveness and
unity of the Security Council restored in dealing with
this humanitarian issue, as well as all other outstanding
issues related to conflict resolution and the
maintenance of international peace and security.
