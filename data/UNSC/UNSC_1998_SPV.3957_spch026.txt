The President (interpretation from Arabic): I would
like to express my thanks to all members for their kind
words addressed to me and for their cooperation in
holding this kind of general public meeting. In this
connection, I would like to mention that credit goes to my
predecessors as well. Would the representative of Sweden
like to comment on the statements made thus far?
