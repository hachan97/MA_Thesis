Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Many words have been spoken and many
pronouncements made here today. But the first
impression I would like to share with my colleagues is
that they have not been looking at the clock. It is now
9.30 pm. our time, which means that in Ukraine it is
about 3.30 am. That means that in a couple of hours
it will be Monday morning, 14 April. That is the date
when it has been agreed that Mr. Turchynov's criminal
decree sending Ukraine's military forces to suppress
the protests will take effect.

We have heard many unfair pronouncements about
Russia today, but of course the most unfair of all came
from our Ukrainian colleague, who accused Russia of
terrorism. Why did he not accuse those who terrorized
his Government for months on end, up to 21 February,
of terrorism? They were people who really did terrorize
the forces of law and order, who really did attack police
and shoot at them and at those protesting against the
authorities and seemed to be attacking their country.
Why were they not called terrorists? Indeed, they have
been exempted from any responsibility for the criminal
activities they conducted for several months.

I reiterate that, unfortunately, several clumsy
accusations have been made against Russia. It has
been said that Russia somehow wishes to destabilize
Ukraine, if not practically crush it altogether. But
why was there no response to our call at the start of
the crisis for launching a dialogue on how to help
Ukraine emerge from the political and economic crisis
it had found itself in? Why was the crisis encouraged
to continue? Why was it only just a few days ago that
the Foreign Ministers of France, Germany and Poland
said that the European Union and Russia should indeed
talk about the economic prospects for Ukraine, Georgia
and Moldova in connection with their joining the
partnership programme of the European Union. And,
by the way, we have heard nothing about the fact that
those ministerial conversations took place in Brussels.

Let us see what the response will be to the
reproaches to Russia over the fact that we do not want
supply Ukraine with gas for free. Let us see on 14 April
what response the European ministers will give to the
letter that President Putin wrote proposing that we work
together to help Ukraine emerge from its economic
turmoil. It is true that the people in Washington,
DC, to whom we did not send the letter, have already
poisoned it for the European Union, calling it economic
blackmail. But let us see whether the European Union
has retained some kind of sovereignty and whether it is
capable of making independent, rational decisions that
can help to rescue the situation from crisis.

During the entire course of the crisis in Ukraine,
Russia has never advocated aggravating it or
destabilizing the country. We have absolutely no
interest in doing such a thing, since for us Ukraine is
too important as an economic and political partner and a
country that is very close to us in many ways. We do not
desire its destabilization. We are not to blame for what
has produced the results that we are now witnessing.
Mr. Fernandez-Taranco said that it was on 6 April that
the actions were first observed whereby residents of
south-eastern areas of Ukraine were seizing certain
administrative buildings. And in this, of course, they
learned from the experience of the Maidan in Kyiv,
where for weeks and months administrative buildings
were occupied, and which for some reason our Western
partners saw as demonstrations of democracy.

But when it came to the south-eastern regions of
Ukraine, somehow such tactics were unacceptable. A
month and a half elapsed between 21 February and
6 April; a month and a half had gone by since the
overthrow of President Yanukovych and the conclusion
of the agreement that could have prevented an escalation
of the situation. From the very beginning, all we said
was that it was essential to conclude that agreement;
that perhaps a constitutional assembly should be
convoked; and that some decisive gesture should be
made towards the south-eastern regions of Ukraine.
Was any such gesture made? Finally, Mr. Yatsenyuk
came, said something and left. Then Mr. Turchynov
came the next day and did not seem to agree with him.
It seemed they preferred to use force.

Incidentally, some very worrying tones have
crept into our numerous contacts with our Western
colleagues. As the Council knows, our Minister for
Foreign Affairs, Mr. Sergei Lavrov, has been talking to
Secretary of State Kerry on the phone almost every day.
Kerry continually claims to understand our concern
that in contacts with the Ukrainian authorities genuine
efforts should be made to ensure that they demonstrate
a better grasp of the concerns of the south-eastern
regions of Ukraine regarding a definition of their
autonomy, independence and language rights. And then
suddenly one ofthe United States Deputy Secretaries of
State gets up in Congress and says, we know that these
talks will not lead anywhere, but we have to occupy the
time somehow. "Occupy the time." So, really, maybe
somebody in Washington, DC, is thinking about
Turchynov's military offensive scenario. In which
case, there is no need to accuse Russia of attempting
destabilization.

The representative of the United States noted that
Vice-President Biden will be going to Ukraine, it seems,
on 21 April. But maybe he should not wait for 21 April.
Maybe he should go right now. Pick up the phone, call
Mr. Turchynov - as he called President Yanukovych
more than once before 21 February - and say to him
what he said to Mr. Yanukovych. As we were informed
by the Vice-President's Chief of Staff, he said, "For
God's sake, just do not use force. Call off your forces
from the centre of Kyiv". That was what Mr. Biden
said. And now, is the United States going to encourage
the fulfilment of this criminal decree authorizing the
use of military force? Why, in one case, when it was
a question of preparations to storm the residence of
the President of Ukraine, the call was that under no
circumstances should force be used, while in the current
situation, it is to encourage the insane military actions
that Turchynov's decree talks about? I would therefore
request Ms. Power to ask Vice-President Biden to call
Mr. Turchynov right now, because in a few hours' time
things might take an irreversible turn.

Many colleagues mentioned the meeting that was
announced for 17 April. Indeed, for some months now,
in particular during the period after 21 February, we
have constantly encouraged such formats for dialogue
as a possible way to achieve a solution to the crisis. We
agreed in principle that the meeting would take place
among the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian
Federation, Secretary of State Kerry, Ms. Ashton
and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. We
very much hope that such a high-level meeting will
encourage a broad political dialogue in Ukraine and
show the way towards a political solution to the crisis.
But what does the Council think? If armed force is used
and hostilities take place tomorrow, are we really going
to sign off on that meeting? Of course, that initiative
is going to be fundamentally undermined if military
operations are commenced in south-eastern Ukraine.

Please, let us refrain from any accusations or
speculation as to why Russia is trying to do what it
is doing. Let us focus our attention on what we can
actually do in this case. Here I am speaking to my
Western colleagues. Let us ensure that we do not permit
the Ukrainian authorities to commit the reckless actions
that are currently enshrined in the criminal decree by
Mr. Turchynov, and let us stop that decree from being
implemented. That would have extremely significant
consequences, first and foremost for the people of
Ukraine, of course. That needs to be avoided.
