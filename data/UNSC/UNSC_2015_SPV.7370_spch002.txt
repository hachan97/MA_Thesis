Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation supports the extension
of the mandate of the United Nations Peacekeeping
Force in Cyprus, which plays an important role in
maintaining peace and stability on the island. That is
why we voted in favour of resolution 2197 (2015).

At the same time, we would like to note that the
resolution contains several flaws, first and foremost
the lack of readiness of the authors to heed the view
of the majority of the members of the Security Council
with regard to the issue of renewing intercommunal
negotiations. We have a number of serious questions
concerning the way in which the work of the penholders
was organized, including the delayed consultations on
a contentious draft text. Therefore, the time crunch was
detrimental to the resolution.
