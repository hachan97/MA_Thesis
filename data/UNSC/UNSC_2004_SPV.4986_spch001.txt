The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Alvaro de Soto, Under-Secretary-
General and Special Adviser to the Secretary-General
on Cyprus.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. De Soto to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on his mission of good
offices in Cyprus, document S/2004/437.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Alvaro de Soto, Under-Secretary-
General and Special Adviser to the Secretary-General
on Cyprus. I now give him the floor.
