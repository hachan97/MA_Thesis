Mr. Shen Bo (China) (spoke in Chinese): China has
listened to the briefing of Prosecutor Bensouda.
Lately, the situation in Darfur has, on the whole,
calmed down. The Sudanese Government is dedicated
to maintaining peace and stability, pushing forward the
political process and promoting economic and social
development. China welcomes all of those developments.

The question of Darfur involves a host of
factors - namely, political, security, development and
humanitarian. As such, it requires integrated solution,
of which the political process represents the basis. It is
the key to the question of Darfur.

Thanks to the mediation by the African Union High-
Level Implementation Panel, a road-map agreement
was signed by the Justice and Equality Movement,
the Sudan Liberation Army/Minni Minawi and other
armed groups. The priority at hand for the international
community is to support the implementation of the
agreement by the Sudanese Government and the armed
opposition groups, help them reach consensus on
outstanding issues through negotiation, and at the same
time urge the Sudan Liberation Army/Abdul Wahid, to
participate in the peace process unconditionally, in a
joint effort to seek a comprehensive political settlement
of the question of Darfur.

The international community should take an
objective and fair stance, respect the sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity of the Sudan, and
play a constructive role in the political settlement of the
question of Darfur.

China's position on the handling of the question of
the Sudan by the International Criminal Court (ICC)
remains unchanged. We welcome the fact that the
African Union has set up a council of ministers to deal
with the ICC's handling ofthe question ofthe Sudan. We
support the legitimate concerns of the African Union
and the Sudanese Government on the handling of the
question of the Sudan by the ICC. Those legitimate
concerns must receive adequate attention.
