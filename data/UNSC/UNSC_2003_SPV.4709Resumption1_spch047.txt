The President: Before giving the floor to the
next speaker, the representative of Honduras, I would
like to discuss a few points of procedure.

First of all, I still have 13 speakers on my list.
Not all of them, I understand, are in the Council
Chamber right now. We are faced now with the
situation where either we could go on and hear the
remaining speakers on the list - which might take
until 1.30 p.m. if everybody sticks to seven minutes -
or we might end up with three or four speakers not
having had the opportunity to take the floor. We would
then have to reconvene at 3 p.m.

My suggestion is that we try to finish now. This is
also a matter of courtesy for the last speakers, because
if there are only three or four speakers left for the
afternoon session, then most probably they will not get
the same audience as they would have here now. So, if
the Council agrees, I would propose that we finish now,
and I would appeal to all speakers: please stick to the
seven minutes as a matter of courtesy to those who
come after you.

My second remark is that I should like to inform
the Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of El Salvador and Zimbabwe in which
they request to be invited to participate in the
discussion. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite
those representatives to participate in the discussion,
without the right to vote, in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Lagos
Pizzati (El Salvador) and Mr. Muchetwa
(Zimbabwe) took the seats reserved for them at
the side ofthe Council Chamber.

The President: I give the floor to the
representative of Honduras.
