Mr. Nitzan (Israel): I will be very brief. In reply to
the statement of representative of Saudi Arabia made
just now, there is a phrase in Arabic that says, "words
are cheap" or "you can say whatever you want" 4 with
full impunity, let us say. I think that the representative
of Saudi Arabia proved right now, in talking about the
protection of civilians and double standards, and earlier,
about commissions of inquiry, that this Arabic phrase
is very valid with respect to his cynical argumentation.
