Mr. Cho Hyun (Republic ofKorea): I am compelled
to reply to North Korea's truly regrettable arguements.

As shown in multiple Security Council resolutions,
the international community has repeatedly made
it clear that it will not recognize North Korea as a
nuclear-weapon State in any case. North Korea must
stop its provocations and sincerely return to dialogue
towards denuclearization. Hopefully, North Korea will
recognize that that is the only path towards a secure and
stable future.

The meeting rose at 12.40 pm.
