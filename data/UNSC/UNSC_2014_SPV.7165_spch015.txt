Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The recent events in south-eastern Ukraine
and the country as a whole are of the most serious
concern. The Kyiv regime, spurred on by Western
well-wishers, are stubbornly pushing the country to
disaster. Today, Western colleagues have spoken many
critical words regarding the activities of protesters in
south-eastern Ukraine. If our Western colleagues had
actually demonstrated a tenth of that commitment to
maintaining order during the events at the Maidan then
perhaps the current crisis could have been prevented.

On 17 April in Geneva, agreement was reached
that all sides should refrain from any types of violence,
intimidation or provocation. However, in just a matter
of days, there was a resumption ofthe so-called counter-
terrorist, but actually punitive, operations - out and
out violations of that agreement. In the south-east,
there was a deployment of roughly 15,000 military
personnel, tanks, armed vehicles, artillery, aircraft
and subdivisions of Right Sector Banderists. As the
first attempts to bring military pressure to bear on
the south-east led to the defection of some Ukrainian
military to the side of the protesters, today the sub-units
are staffed by those from the west of the country. One
might wonder what political and psychological effect
that has had on the south-east and how it ties in with the
task of ensuring the territorial integrity of the country.
In Geneva, it seemed that there was a window
of opportunity for a significant de-escalation of the
situation in Ukraine at the beginning of broad national
dialogue. However, almost immediately following
the declarations and actions of the Kyiv Government
authorities, it became clear that they had no intention
of implementing the agreement, just as they did not
intend to implement the agreement of 21 February.
In both cases, that treachery led to bloodshed.
Unfortunately, it is difficulty to speak of confidence
in the current coalition in Kyiv when the defence and
law-enforcement agencies are essentially controlled by
the Svoboda Party, whose political platform is based
on declarations issued by Nazi collaborators in June
1941. Pursuant to those declarations, real Ukrainians
should have collaborated with Hitler to establish a new
order in Europe. I would recall that the collaborators
and the followers of Bandera killed not only Jews, Poles
and Soviet soldiers but also Ukrainians who refused to
subscribe to their sloganeering.

In Geneva, there was agreement on the need for a
full rejection of extremism. However, the Right Sector
Banderists, instead of laying down their weapons,
headed to the east of Ukraine. As was declared, the
Banderist army crossed the Dnepr. Neither the Right
Sector with its Nazi slogans nor any other radical
organizations have laid down their arms. On the
contrary, those groups have become legal. They are
forming military battalions with names like Dnepr and
Donbass in their ranks. How could the militias in the
east be convinced to disarm or vacate buildings if they
have been surrounded, as has happened in Sloviansk,
by subdivisions of the Ukrainian armed forces and the
so-called National Guard, comprised of fighters from
the Right Sector.

In Geneva, there was agreement that there had to
be a single approach to all illicit activities in Ukraine
from whichever side they might emanate - that is,
from Kyiv, the west, the east or the south. However, the
Maidan remains occupied - cement blockades are still
in place - as are several buildings in Kyiv. No one has
liberated anything in Kyiv. In Washington, DC, they
are saying, uncritically, that the buildings have been
legally rented. But by whom? They have been rented by
armed fighters.

In Geneva, there was agreement that there should
be amnesty for protestors. However, instead of that,
the People's Governor of Donetsk, Pavel Gubarev, who
never had weapons in his hand, remains in prison. He
is a political prisoner, arrested just because he called
for a referendum on the federalization of Ukraine.
The monitors of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) confirm that he was
tortured and that he is now engaged in an indefinite
hunger strike. Mr. Gubarev is far from being the only
political prisoner of the Kyiv regime. One can speak
of widespread witch hunts for those who have dared
to express their disagreement with the Government in
the Maidan. According to our sources, in the Donetsk
region there are already about 10 cases of politically
motivated kidnappings of people who were later
transported to Kyiv by the special services.

On 28 April, there was an attack on the life of
the popular mayor of Kharkiv, Hennadiy Kernes. My
colleague from the United Kingdom rushed to say
that the protesters in the south-east participated in
that crime. That demands a careful investigation of
the case. Let us not try to prejudge the outcome. It
is true that Mr. Kernes had indeed spoken out about
the chaos in other regions of Ukraine, and there were
serious political battles between him and one of the
heads of the defence and law-enforcement agencies. On
the same day - 28 April - at the Kherson airport,
the presidential candidate's plane was blocked. He had
been travelling as part ofthe presidential campaign. He
was attacked. In early April another candidate, Oleh
Tsarev, was severely beaten. He was the only candidate
for the presidential election without State protection.
Mr. Tsarev was stripped of his right to participate in
the televised debates. In that context, can we speak
about the peaceful nature of the electoral campaign in
Ukraine and of freedom of expression for its civilians?

The key point of the Geneva agreement was broad
national dialogue, which was to take into account
the interests of all regions and political formations.
The Kyiv Government made certain promises with
regard to constitutional reforms and upholding the
rights of minorities. But what about national dialogue
and reform? According to meadia reports, today
Mr. Yatsenyuk submitted to the Rada some sort of draft
constitution. It is not really clear how it was prepared.
What is certain is that it was not an open and inclusive
process. In fact, the Party of Regions, which represents
the rest of the east of the country, was excluded from the
process. It is no surprise that the draft was immediately
criticized in the Rada by all sides. We did not hear any
reasonable answers to key questions, such as how the
federalization or decentralization of the country would
take place. It seems such things are to be substituted
by some type of broadening of municipalities. How is
the issue of the status of the Russian language to be
resolved?

Can anyone seriously assert that all those activities
by Kyiv are a solution to the political crisis aimed at
stabilizing Ukraine? Instead of genuine collective work
to bring Ukraine out of the crisis, which was brought
about by political misadventurism, our colleagues
from the United States and the European Union
have preferred to make strong insinuations against
Russia and thinking up some sort of sanctions that
are pointless and counterproductive. Perhaps they are
satisfactory to some one, but the responsibility for the
future of Ukraine, Europe and the world is not being
considered - at least not by these people.

The result is that the Government in Kyiv has
done nothing to implement the Geneva document. Our
Western colleagues, first and foremost our American
colleagues, which have an unprecedented impact on the
situation in Kyiv, do not want, or have not been able,
to convince the Government to uphold its obligations
under the document. They must clearly understand the
scope of their responsibility if the situation in Ukraine
continues to deteriorate.

It is very difficult for us in Russia to see the chaos
in such a close, fraternal country. But we understand
the reason that brought about the protests in the east
and south. People do not want a repeat of the Kyiv
scenario. They do not recognize the legitimacy of the
Kyiv Government, which is made up of oligarchs. They
have decided to create their own governing bodies.
In response, they have been accused of terrorism and
punished by military operations.

We call upon the Kyiv regime and its Western
sponsors to think twice. There is a need to lift the
order on using arms against civilians, as well as to
free the political prisoners and disarm the Right
Sector. A full constitutional process must take place,
including representatives from all regions. We hope
that the OSCE mission, headed by Mr. Apakan, which
plays a particular role in the implementation of the
Geneva agreement, will provide the Kyiv Government
with assistance in establishing national dialogue and
seeking understanding with the people in the south-
east. However, the most important work to de-escalate
should be done by the Kyiv Government - as they call
themselves.

I should now like to say a few words with regard to
the issues touched on by colleagues.
On the OSCE monitors in Sloviansk, they were
requested by the Kyiv Government, and as such were
responsible for their security. How can people be sent
on a bus to an area controlled by self-defence forces,
without even providing documents that would confirm
their status? That was either a provocation by the Kyiv
Government or just simple stupidity. We are doing
everything we can for the freeing of those prisoners,
and one has already been released due to health reasons.

With regard to armed forces, our armed forces are
on Russian territory. American forces are hardly at
home. They are in Australia, Lithuania, Poland and on
the Black Sea, where an American vessel has remained
longer than it was invited to do. Yes, our troops do
conduct training exercises. But they do so in atransparent
manner and while upholding all existing international
agreements. We do not have any aggressive intentions
towards Ukraine. They Kyiv Government should keep
a cool head and not engage in reckless activities with
respect to the people in the south-east of the country,
where there are many Russian citizens as well.
