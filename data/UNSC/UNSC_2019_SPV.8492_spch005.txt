Mr. Polyanskiy (Russian Federation) (spoke in French): I would just like to say a few words,

speaking in French so as not to disrupt the francophone
atmosphere of this meeting. On behalf of us all, I
would like to pay tribute to our French friends for their
excellent logistical support and assistance throughout
the mission. The United Nations experts, including the
members of the Security Council Affairs Division and
the interpreters, also did excellent work.
