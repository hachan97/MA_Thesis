The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of
Austria to the United Nations in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

Mr. Wimmer (Austria) took the seat reserved for him
at the side of the Council Chamber.
The next speaker is the representative of Sweden. I
invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make
his statement.
