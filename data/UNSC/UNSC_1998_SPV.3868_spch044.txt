The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have just received a letter from the representative of
the Islamic Republic of Iran in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the discussion without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Nejad
Hosseinian (Islamic Republic of Iran) took a seat at
the Council table.

The President: I give the floor to the representative
of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
