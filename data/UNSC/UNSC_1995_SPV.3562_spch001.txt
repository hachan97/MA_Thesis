The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received letters from the representatives of
Angola and Brazil in which they request to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's
agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose,
with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Fortes (Angola)
took a place at the Council table; Mr. Valle (Brazil)
took the place reserved for him at the side of the
Council Chamber.

The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Angola
Verification Mission (UNAVEM. III) (S/ 1995/588).

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/ 1995/646, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations.

The first speaker is the representative of Angola,
whom I invite to make his statement.
