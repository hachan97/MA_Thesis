Mr. Bessho (Japan): I shall say more following
the adoption of the agenda, but wish to make a brief
statement before we vote on the adoption of the
agenda itself.

In December 2014 and again in December 2015,
under the agenda item "The situation in the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea", the Security Council held
meetings on the situation in the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, which focused on its widespread
and systematic human rights violations. Given the
fact that there has been no tangible improvement in
the human rights situation in the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea since the publication of the 2014
report of the commission of inquiry (A/HRC/25/63),
and given the destabilizing impact on the region and the
maintenance of international peace and security of the
human rights violations perpetrated by the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea authorities, the reasons for
the Council to hold a meeting on the situation in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea persist. We
therefore support the adoption of the agenda.
