The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

I would like to draw Council members" attention
to a letter from the President of the Security Council
dated 9 February 2017, inviting States Members
and Permanent Observers of the United Nations
to communicate to the presidency, if they so wish,
suggestions regarding issues concerning the work of
the Security Council during the month of February to
be proposed for consideration at our meeting today.

I would like to thank the Member States that have
submitted contributions to us. We were happy to see
that they came from various regions of the world.
The questions and proposals suggested concerned
both substantive agenda items and the Council's
working methods, and in our opinion deserve our
serious consideration. An informal list of all the
communications received was brought to Council
members' attention. We hope that delegations will
address the issues that were raised in their statements
today. In the view of the presidency, establishing such
a practice could contribute to enhancing the interaction
between the Council and the general membership of the
United Nations.

I now give the floor to the members of the
Security Council.
