The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Georgia, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

On behalf of the Council, I welcome the Minister
for Special Affairs of Georgia, His Excellency
Mr. Malkhaz Kakabadze, and invite him to take a seat
at the Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Abkhazia, Georgia, contained in document S/2002/742.
Members also have document 8/2002/845, which
contains the text of a draft resolution prepared in the
Council's prior consultations.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
