The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on the agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the letter
dated 7 December 1995 from the Chairman of the Security
Council Committee established by resolution 661 (1990)
concerning the situation between Iraq and Kuwait addressed
to the President of the Security Council, document
S/1995/1017.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/1996/221, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by France, Germany, Italy, the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the
United States of America.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. If I
hear no objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the
vote.

There being is no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council who
wish to make statements before the voting.
