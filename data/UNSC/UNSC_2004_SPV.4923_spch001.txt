earlier today in Madrid, killing more than 190 people
and wounding over 1,000. The members of the Security
Council condemn this act of terrorism in the strongest
possible terms. They express their sympathy and
condolences to the victims and their families and to the
Government of Spain. On behalf of the members of the
Security Council, I should like to request the
representative of Spain to convey these sentiments to
the Government and the people of Spain.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
