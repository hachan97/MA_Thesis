Mr. Vitrenko (Ukraine): I also apologize for taking
the floor again. I will be very brief. Out of respect for
the presidency, colleagues around the table and the
broader United Nations membership, I will confine
myselfjust to a few brief points.

First, we do not intend to engage in a debate at this
table about obvious facts that are clear to everyone but
the culprit State. Instead of reacting to the multiple
allegations of various types on the part of the aggressor
State, let me just say that the Ukrainian delegation and
State fully stand by the statement that we delivered.

Secondly, the threats to the regime established by
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
that we mentioned in our statement originate from the
Russian aggression against Ukraine, which started
with the attempted illegal annexation of Crimea and
continued with Russia's intervention and fuelling of
conflict in the eastern part of Ukraine. In our view, that
of course has a direct bearing on the subject of today's
debate, as well as on the Security Council's mandate.
