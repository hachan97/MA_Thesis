Mr. Escalante Hasblin (El Salvador) (spoke in Spanish): I believe that it is regrettable when any country
in Latin America and the Caribbean is the subject of
discussions within the Security Council. I make that
point irrespective of the views that the members of the
Security Council might have - and, more important
yet, those that members of the General Assembly might
have - as to whether or not it is fitting for the Security
Council to take up item X, Y or Z.

I understand that I am one of the last speakers
on the list today, and I will therefore try to be very
brief and get to the point, while also out of respect
for everyone's weekend. I would like to begin by
welcoming the presence of Minister Jorge Arreaza of
Venezuela. We would like to once again reiterate in this
forum a point that was previously made by my national
authorities, that is, expressing our deep concern about
the new escalation in the political confrontation that
is undermining the stability and development of our
brother country Venezuela.

Once again, we express our view that it is
principally incumbent upon the Government and the
other Venezuelan political forces to find a solution to
any problem or dispute within the country's society,
while it is imperative to rely on the political track
and resume discussions leading to an agreement. As
a responsible State, a member of the international
community and a founding Member of the United
Nations, El Salvador reiterates that the peaceful
resolution of disputes and full respect for the principles
of non-intervention, the sovereignty of States and the
prohibition of the use of force or the threat of the use
of force are the best way forward for overcoming any
difficulty confronting Venezuela and for contributing
to regional stability, which is extremely vital for all
with regard to the development and well-being of our
peoples in the region.

Lastly, we recall that the Government of El Salvador
expresses its support for the diplomatic initiative of
those countries that are committed to achieving peace
and stability in the region and foster and hope to
contribute to finding a political and peaceful solution
to the disputes in Venezuela.
