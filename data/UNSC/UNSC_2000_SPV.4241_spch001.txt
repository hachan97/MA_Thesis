The President (spoke in Russian): As this is the
first meeting of the Security Council for the month of
December, I should like to take this opportunity to pay
tribute, on behalf of the Council, to His Excellency
Mr. Peter van Walsum, Permanent Representative of
the Netherlands to the United Nations, for his service
as President of the Security Council for the month of
November 2000. I am sure I speak for all members of
the Security Council in expressing deep appreciation to
Ambassador van Walsum for the great diplomatic skill
with which he conducted the Council's business last
month.

Report of the Secretary-General pursuant to
paragraph 5 of resolution 1302 (2000)
(S/2000/1132)

The President (spoke in Russian): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 5
of resolution 1302 (2000), document S/2000/1132.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2000/ll49, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements before the voting.
