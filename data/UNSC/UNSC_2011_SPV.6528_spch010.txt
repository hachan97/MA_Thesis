Mrs. Viotti (Brazil): I thank Prosecutor Moreno-
Ocampo for his briefing and for the first report of the
International Criminal Court (ICC) pursuant to
resolution 1970 (2011). We are concerned at the
continuation of hostilities in Libya. An immediate
ceasefire and the establishment of an inclusive political
process that can address the aspirations of the Libyan
population and bring about durable peace in Libya are
more urgent than ever.

Brazil is deeply concerned by the ongoing
violence and the use of force against civilians. We are
troubled by the reports of killings of civilians, unlawful
arrests, torture, forced disappearances and rape. The
referral of the Libyan case to the ICC, mandated by
resolution 1970 (2011), underscores the concerns of the
international community at the aggression committed
against the civilian population in Libya. Those in
control of military capabilities, and their subordinates,
must cease all violence against civilians.

As developments in Libya unfold, we hope that
the ICC investigations can have an impact on the
desired goals - a cease to violence and the restoration
of calm. In the post-conflict stage, the ICC's role will
continue to be essential in helping to ensure
accountability and justice, which are so important to
achieving durable peace.

In order for the ICC to help achieve these vital
objectives, the ongoing investigations leading to
possible future proceedings must be thorough,
transparent and impartial. We urge all parties to the
conflict to fully cooperate with the ICC.
