The President (spoke in Russian): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Hans Corell, Under-Secretary-
General for Legal Affairs, the Legal Counsel.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Corell to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting today in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Hans Corell, Under-Secretary-General
for Legal Affairs, the Legal Counsel. I give him the
floor.
