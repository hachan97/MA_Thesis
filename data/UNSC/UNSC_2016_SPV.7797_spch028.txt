The President (spoke in Russian): I thank Mr. Hadi
for his statement.

I believe that today's meeting was very useful and
enabled us to once again better understand how tragic
and complicated the situation in Yemen is and the
complicated nature of the work of the Special Envoy
of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ismail Ould Cheikh
Ahmed. I would therefore like to conclude this meeting
by expressing strong support for his efforts, which we

all hope will lead to peace in Yemen as soon as possible.

The meeting rose at 12.45 p.rn.
