The President (spoke in Chinese): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Cote d'Ivoire in which he requests
to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Ahipeaud

table.

Council will now continue its consideration of the item
on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.
