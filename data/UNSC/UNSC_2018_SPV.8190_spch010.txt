Ms. Schoulgin Nyoni (Sweden): I will be brief
today, as the Security Council will address the political
and humanitarian situation in Yemen tomorrow.

Sweden welcomes the renewal of the sanctions regime
pursuant to resolution 2140 (2014) and the extension
of the mandate of the Panel of Experts on Yemen.
Sweden approached today's voting from a position of
principle, as we are fully committed to the effective
use of sanctions as one of our many tools for restoring
and maintaining international peace and security. We
strongly support the United Nations panel-of-experts
instruments, and it is important that the Council uphold
the integrity, independence and effectiveness of its
sanctions instruments and panels. Lastly, concerning
the resolution's substance, we reiterate that the arms
embargo is a vital part of the sanctions regime that must
be upheld, as should the resolution's calls for all parties
to comply with international humanitarian law and to
provide humanitarian access.
