Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
should like to begin by thanking you, Sir, for
convening today's open meeting. I also thank the
Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC),
the Permanent Representative of Spain, Ambassador
Arias, for his briefing.

China commends the CTC for its efforts to
facilitate the implementation of resolution 1373 (2001)
by all countries and to help developing countries to
improve their counter-terrorism capacity-building. We
support the CTC in its coordination and cooperation
with the relevant international, regional and
subregional organizations to fight terrorism. At the
same time, we hope that the CTC will step up its
efforts to provide counter-terrorism assistance and do
its utmost to meet the needs of the developing
countries.

The current effort to revitalize the CTC has
drawn the attention of the overall membership. After
repeated consultations, the CTC has issued a formal
report, which it has circulated as a document of the
Security Council. After more than two years of
operation, the CTC's existing structure and working
methods have revealed their shortcomings, such as the
overburden of reporting on the part of the Member
States and a surfeit of meetings and documents. Its
efficiency must be improved and there is a lack of
coordination among the experts. We therefore fully
support the necessary reform of the CTC and endorse
the package of measures contained in the report,
including the establishment of an executive directorate.

We hope that the existing problems will be duly
addressed as soon as possible, in particular the issue of
overreporting on the part of the Member States. It
should be noted that revitalization and reform are an
ongoing process. No matter how reform is undertaken,
the CTC should maintain its policy guidance over the
work of the executive directorate. All decisions should
be taken through consensus in the CTC plenary.
