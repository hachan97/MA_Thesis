Mr. Llorentty Soliz (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): I shall be very brief.

Bolivia voted in favour of the draft resolution
(S/2018/322) for several reasons. One of those is
that, although the nature of the events that have been
condemned is unknown, the highest authorities of
the Organization have pointed out that the United
Nations is not is a position to verify the reports of such
events. It is therefore essential to establish the truth by
means of an independent and impartial investigation.
Many of those reports come from non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), and we know who finances
those NGOs. Therefore, we must allow doubts with
regard to such sources.

Analysing the draft resolution submitted by the
Russian Federation word by word, from the point of
view of intellectual integrity, commitment to the Syrian
people or international law, we found no reason to vote
against the draft resolution.

Nevertheless, what concerns us is what is being
planned outside the structure of this edifice. While it
was said today that Lenin and Marx would probably
be turning in their graves, I do not know about that.
But what is certain is that Churchill and Roosevelt,
for example, are turning in their graves because, as
founding fathers of the structure of this world order,
they endowed the Security Council with the authority
to use force to deal with threats to international
peace and security. I am not sure that they would be
very happy that the outcome of such events, without
a full and conclusive investigation, is that some of its
members undertake the unilateral use of force. In any
case, we remain hopeful that the Security Council will
shoulder its responsibility and that, through unity, it can
help to identify the perpetrators of any attack against
international peace and security, if that is the case.
