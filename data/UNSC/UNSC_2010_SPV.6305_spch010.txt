Mr. Dolgov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Resolution 1920 (2010), extending by a
further 12 months the mandate of the United Nations
Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, is the
result of prolonged and complex discussions, first
within the Group of Friends and then within the
Security Council. Working on the resolution, the
Russian Federation saw the need to draft a Security
Council decision that would ensure progress in the
negotiating process and be of use to the Personal
Envoy of the Secretary-General, Mr. Christopher Ross,
whose efforts we support.

The decision of the Security Council meets that
need. The resolution achieves a good balance between
the interests of the two parties and will help them to
preserve and, we hope, consolidate their progress
towards reaching a fair, lasting and mutually beneficial
solution to the problem in Western Sahara. We are
convinced that the resolution meets the criteria of
impartiality and objectivity and, to the greatest
10-33760
possible extent, takes into account the perspectives of
the parties. We believe that the resolution adopted
today will facilitate effective progress in the settlement
process in Western Sahara, with the support of the
United Nations.
