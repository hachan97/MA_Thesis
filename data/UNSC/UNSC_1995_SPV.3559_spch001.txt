The President (interpretation from Spanish): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Canada, Haiti and Venezuela, in
which they request to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives to
participate in the discussion without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Longchamp
(Haiti) took a place at the Council table; Mr.
Karsgaard (Canada) and Mr. Manzanares (Venezuela)
took the places reserved for them at the side of the
Council Chamber.

The President (interpretation from Spanish): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Mission in
Haiti, document S/ 1995/614. Members of the Council also
have before them document S/ 1995/629, which contains the
text of a draft resolution submitted by Argentina, Canada,
France, Honduras, the United States of America and
Venezuela.

The first speaker is the representative of Canada. I
invite him to take a place at the Council table and to make
his statement.
