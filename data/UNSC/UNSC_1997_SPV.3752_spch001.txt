The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of
Tajikistan in which he requests to be invited to participate
in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Alimov
(Tajikistan) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General on the situation in Tajikistan,
document S/ 1997/ 198. Members of the Council also have
before them document 8/1997/216, which contains the text
of a draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to the following other documents: S/ 1997/ 169,
letter dated 24 February 1997 from the Charge d'affaires ad
interim of the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic
of Iran to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-
General; and S/1997/209, letter dated 10 March 1997 from
the Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to
the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General.

The first speaker is the representative of Tajikistan, on
whom I now call.
