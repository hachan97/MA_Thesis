Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Unfortunately, the Ukrainian delegation once
again used this meeting ofthe Security Council to divert
attention from the issues discussed. We would like to
recall that the current authorities in Kyiv unleashed an
armed confrontation with their own people in the south-
east of the country. It resulted in numerous casualties
among the civilian population and the destruction of
infrastructure. If the Ukrainian delegation wants to use
the experience of the ICTY to bring those responsible
to justice, then the first clients of justice will be the
current authorities in Kyiv and their accomplices.
