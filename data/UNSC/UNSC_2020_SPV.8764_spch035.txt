The President (spoke in Russian): I did not randomly ask whether the representative of Germany wished to speak on a point of order. If he would like to make an additional statement then I can give him the floor at the end of the meeting, but if he wishes to speak on a point of order, I am obliged to give him the floor immediately. For next time, I inform the German representative that if he wishes to say something or make a comment on what I have to say, then I can give him the floor and he is free to do so, but it must be done in accordance with the proper procedures.
