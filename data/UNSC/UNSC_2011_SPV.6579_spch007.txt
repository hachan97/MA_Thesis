The President: I have no explanation as to why
the political coordinators have not come up with that
idea. But we can change the language ad hoc, right
now, if I hear no objection. I think this is not a
theological issue; it is a factual issue, and I take it that
our colleagues around the table can live with that
suggestion by our colleague from the United States.
