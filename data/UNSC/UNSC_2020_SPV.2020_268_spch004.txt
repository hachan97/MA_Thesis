I have the honour to address you, Sir, in your capacity as the President of the Security Council for the month of March 2020, on your initiative on resolution 2518 (2020), on the safety and security of peacekeepers, and to assure you of the support of the Russian Federation in this regard. I also have the honour to inform you, Sir, about the decision of the Russian Federation to co-sponsor the resolution. Let me express our profound gratitude for this important and timely initiative. We are grateful that the provisions of the resolution correspond to the comprehensive approach agreed during the latest session of the General Assembly Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations in March. We highly appreciate your constructive role during the negotiation process and your efforts to take into account key concerns of all members of the Security Council, including the references to the Basic Principles of Peacekeeping as well as the primacy of political solutions in conflict settlement, which remain imperative for the United Nations peacekeeping. We also support your approach, Sir, to highlight the importance of taking all the appropriate measures to enhance the safety and security of peacekeeping personnel. The resolution also calls for further enhancing the partnership between the United Nations and regional as well as subregional organizations in relation to the safety and security of peacekeepers. We are convinced that this resolution will make a significant contribution to improving the safety and security of peacekeepers as well as the overall effectiveness of United Nations peacekeeping operations.
