Mr. Beck (Palau): At the outset, I would like to
thank Germany and you personally, Mr. President, for
hosting and leading this very important meeting. I
would also like to thank the United Kingdom for its
inspiring actions three years ago here in the Council. I
associate Palau with the statements made by His
Excellency President Stephen of the Republic of Nauru
and by Parliamentary Secretary Richard Marles, and I
note with appreciation the support of Maldives,
Seychelles and Timor-Leste.

The Security Council is responsible for carrying
out the most crucial international tasks and is, as a
result, accorded extraordinary powers by the Charter.
When a threat to international peace and security
arises, the Security Council has the mandate and
limitless ability to act. That basic function under the

 

Charter should be uncontroversial. Palau is surprised
and disappointed, therefore, to hear any opposition
whatsoever to an outcome from this debate. Today's
best available science shows clearly that the Western
Pacific region has already seen sea levels rise twice as
much as in other regions. The Pacific small island
developing States are in a red zone. Perhaps if others
stood on our vanishing shores, they would better
appreciate our situation. While the causes of this threat
are novel, the effects, which endanger the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of Member States, fit squarely
within the Council's traditional mandate.

The Council has before it the Pacific's modest,
constructive and highly achievable proposals. We
respectfully request that, at a very minimum, the
Council adopt them. If not, I can assure the Council
that this will not be the last word on the issue. The
danger is mounting. Palau will therefore continue to
call on every United Nations entity to intensify its
efforts to address climate change and security.
