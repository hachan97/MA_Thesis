Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian delegation voted in favour
of resolution 2295 (2016), given the importance of
maintaining unanimous Security Council support for the
peace process in Mali and the actions of peacekeepers
in the country. In so doing, we have taken into account
the aspirations of the Government of Mali, which is
seeking to accelerate the stabilization of the country's
northern territories. We remain concerned, however,
that peacekeepers there are risking their lives as they
have become targets for terrorists. We express our
deepest condolences to the Governments of countries
whose nationals have died in fulfilling their duties
in service to the United Nations Multidimensional
Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA).

At the same time, in the course of negotiating
the text of the resolution, some delegations tried to
take advantage of the situation by imposing certain
ambiguous language into the MINUSMA mandate.
We feel it necessary to express our concern about the
vague references in the text to the level of asymmetric
threats that would justify the use of force. We will
leave the burden of responsibility for that imposition
to the conscience of the informal coordinators of the
Mali dossier, who once again have abused their position
and demonstratively disregarded the views of their
colleagues.

Our position is that the relative flexibility that has
been given to MINUSMA - and the possibility of the
use of force - means that peacekeepers still have to
act on the basis of peacekeeping principles. The use of
force should only be considered if a serious threat has
been assessed. Erroneous strikes against civilians carry
additional risks and could lead to threats to the Blue
Helmets themselves, thereby endangering the peace
process as a whole.
