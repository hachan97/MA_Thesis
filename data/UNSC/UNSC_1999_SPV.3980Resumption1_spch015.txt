The President: I will formally ask the Secretariat to
look into the precedents you cited so that we can be
certain that next time we face this issue we have a very
clear idea of the precedents and the practices to which
you refer.

In accordance with the decision taken earlier in the
meeting, I now invite the Permanent Observer for
Switzerland to take a seat at the Council table and make
his statement.
