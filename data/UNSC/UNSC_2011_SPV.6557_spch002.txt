Mr. Dunn (United States of America): The
United States welcomes and strongly supports today's
Council action to implement significant reforms to the
regime under the Security Council Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999) and to
create a new sanctions regime targeting violent
extremists in Afghanistan. With these reforms, the
Council acknowledges that the nature of these threats
has evolved and that events on the ground in
Afghanistan have changed. The Council has also taken
major steps to strengthen fairness and transparency in
its listing and delisting procedures, including to expand
the mandate and enhance the authority of the 1267
Ombudsperson.

The actions that the Council took today, with
Afghan Government support, are designed to support
and promote Afghan-led reconciliation while targeting
those associated with the Taliban and constituting a
threat to the peace, stability and security of
Afghanistan. They will also allow the 1267 Committee
to better tailor its efforts to the unique global threat
posed by Al-Qaida and its affiliates.

We wish to acknowledge the role of the 1267
Monitoring Team in outlining the evolving nature of
the threat and recommending ways for us to modernize
the 1267 sanctions. This sanctions regime is one of the
most important multilateral counter-terrorism tools that
the international community has at its disposal. We
hope today's actions will ensure that these measures
continue to enjoy the full support of the international
community and are fully implemented by all Member
States.
