Mrs. Gregoire Van Haaren (Netherlands) (spoke in French): The Kingdom of the Netherlands welcomes the
unanimous adoption of resolution 2399 (2018). While
the Central African Republic remains engulfed in crisis,
the Security Council today has sent a strong message
to those violating human rights and international
humanitarian law that the world is watching them. In
particular, the Kingdom of the Netherlands is concerned
about religious and ethnic leaders and politicians in the
Central African Republic who are using their power
to incite violence and hatred among the people of that
country. We call on them to end all forms ofhate speech
and to use their influence to build peace.

The Kingdom of the Netherlands is also concerned
about the increase in violence against humanitarian
workers. Organizations like Medecins Sans Frontieres
have had to cease operations in some parts of the
country, and the Central African Republic is today
one of the most dangerous countries in the world for
aid workers. Through today's resolution, the Council
honours those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in
providing indispensable support to the people of the
Central African Republic. Those who have perpetrated
acts of violence against humanitarian workers cannot
go unpunished.

Sanctions alone will not resolve the crisis in the
Central African Republic, and we call on all parties
involved to commit to the peace process within the
framework of the African Initiative for Peace and
Reconciliation in the Central African. By renewing the
sanctions regime through resolution 2399 (2018), which
we adopted today, the Security Council is sending a
strong message for peace.
