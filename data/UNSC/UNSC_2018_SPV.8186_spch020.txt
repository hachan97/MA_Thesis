Mr. J a'afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): The delegation of my country was not aware of
your decision, Sir, to limit my statement to five minutes.
I oppose that decision and therefore reserve the right
to express the views of my country in this important
meeting devoted to the situation in my country.
