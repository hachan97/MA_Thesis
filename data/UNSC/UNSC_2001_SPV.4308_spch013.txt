The President: I might just give a pointer to the
Assistant Secretary-General. When he comes to answer
some of these questions, he will need to consider them
also, perhaps, against the Secretary-General's report
expected at the end of the month. If he can answer
quite briefly some of the points that have been raised,
the Council, I think, will expect some of the points
raised in this discussion to feed into the preparation of
the Secretary-General's report. Some of the questions
raised can be answered at greater length then. At the
end of this meeting, I will be giving some summing-up
pointers for the Council's interest in that forthcoming
report.
