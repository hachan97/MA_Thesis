Mr. Umarov (Kazakhstan): First of all, let me
thank Assistant Secretary-General Miroslav Jenea for
his briefing, as well as the United States and Japan
for calling for consultations on yet another flagrant
violation by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Kazakhstan strongly condemns North Korea's
irresponsible and dangerous launch of a ballistic
missile with a possible intercontinental range, which
undermines our common international efforts to
strengthen regional and ultimately international peace
and security. Today once again, we see how the North
Korean regime continues developing its nuclear-missile
potential and we observe its steady progress in this
direction, which, of course, causes serious concern.
The expansion of the nuclear Powers club is totally
unacceptable for the wider international community.
Therefore, Pyongyang must pursue a contrary approach
to the stance it is taking.

It is our urgent and common task to make North
Korea comply with international will. All Council
members are united in comprehending the full
seriousness and complexity of the situation in North
Korea. Let us use this unity to develop a comprehensive
and balanced approach in order to create conditions for
non-military solutions while maintaining the sanctions
regime and forcing the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea to come to dialogue.

In this regard, Kazakhstan once again calls upon
North Korea to follow its positive example of willingly
abandoning nuclear tests and weapons to live in peace
and harmony with the entire world. We stand ready
to share our role and experience in this area with
Pyongyang if needed.

In conclusion, Kazakhstan is ready to support any
initiative leading to a diplomatic and peaceful solution
to the crisis on the Korean peninsula.
