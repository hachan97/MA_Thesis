Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): While you hold the presidency, Madam
President, you do not have the right to pass judgment
on the status of the Russian Federation in the Security
Council. The second part of your statement only shows
that you are attempting to dilute the circumstances.
Let me put it this way. Even if everything you just said
is right, that has nothing to do with the investigation
into the downed flight. So let us not get into various
political issues and insinuations beyond the scope of
the investigation, because we might have different
opinions in that regard. Let us concentrate on the
required investigation.
