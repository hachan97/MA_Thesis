The President: The result of the voting is as
follows: 12 votes in favour, one vote against and two
abstentions. The draft resolution has not been adopted
owing to the negative vote of a permanent member of
the Council.

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting on the draft resolution.
