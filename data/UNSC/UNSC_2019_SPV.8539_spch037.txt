Mr. Duarte Lopes (Portugal): I thank you,
Mr. President, for convening this open debate on a
subject that is always timely. This new opportunity
to address the Security Council's working methods
constitutes further evidence of your diligent role,
both as President of the Council and as Chair of the
Informal Working Group on Documentation and Other
Procedural Questions. I also thank the briefers for their
comprehensive contributions.

Portugal is a committed member of the Accountability,
Coherence and Transparency group, and we therefore
align our statement with that delivered by the
representative of Switzerland. We also associate
ourselves with the statement made by the representative
of New Zealand on behalf of a cross-regional group of
countries. We also especially welcomed the statement
by the Ambassador of South Africa on behalf of the 10
elected members of the Council.

As a complement to those statements, I would
like to briefly reiterate the following. First we must
definitely guarantee due process in all the Sanctions
Committees through the potential expansion of
the Office of the Ombudsperson's mandate and by
strengthening its independence. Secondly, it is also
crucial to ensure all Council members' equitable access
to the chairmanships of its subsidiary bodies, as well
as a fair share of penholderships on dossiers. Thirdly,
we advocate for involving incoming elected members
in the work of the Council as early as possible.

In conclusion, we trust that during the coming
months and under your able stewardship, Mr. President,
the Informal Working Group will make further progress
on all open items and adopt the draft presidential notes
on specific working methods of the Security Council.
That will certainly contribute to further enhancing the
inclusiveness and effectiveness of the Council's work.
