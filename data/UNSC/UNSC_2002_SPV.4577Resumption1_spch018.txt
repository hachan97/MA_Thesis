Mr. Diarra (spoke in French): What the Security
Council can do is, first of all, to strengthen the
credibility of the decisions taken by ECOWAS. What
are our decisions? Our decisions have been to firmly
condemn attacks in Liberia, not to tolerate the taking of
power by unconstitutional means, to condemn
Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy
(LURD), to put pressure on various parties in Liberia
to bring them to the negotiating table, and to create the
conditions for dialogue in Liberia, making it possible
to create favourable conditions for elections next year.
That is what we expect from the Security Council.
