The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received letters from the representatives of
Ethiopia, Pakistan and Sudan in which they request to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Etefia
(Ethiopia) and Mr. Yassin (Sudan) took seats at the
Council table; Mr. Kamal (Pakistan) took the seat
reserved for him at the side of the Council Chamber.

The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in response to the request contained in
a letter dated 9 January 1996 from the Permanent
Representative of Ethiopia to the United Nations addressed
to the President of the Security Council, document
S/l996/10. Members of the Council have before them
document S/l996/69, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by Botswana, Chile, Egypt, Guinea-
Bissau, Honduras and Indonesia.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to the following other documents: S/ 1996/30,
letter dated 15 January 1996 from the Permanent
Representative of Ethiopia to the United Nations addressed
to the President of the Security Council; S/ 1996/22,
S/ 1996/25 and S/ 1996/29, letters dated 11 and 12 January
1996, respectively, from the Permanent Representative of
Sudan to the United Nations addressed to the President of
the Security Council.

The first speaker is the representative of Ethiopia, on
whom I now call.
