Mr. Rogachev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We did not object to the extension of the
mandate of the ad litem Judge, Judge Joaquin Martin
Canivell. We therefore supported the draft resolution,
since such a decision is in keeping with the completion
strategy of the International Criminal Tribunal for the
Former Yugoslavia.

At the same time, we should like to draw
attention to the fact that the Security Council has now
been obliged for a second time to deal with the issue of
extending the mandate of this judge. We consider that
fact to be further proof of the insufficiently satisfactory
organization of the Tribunal's work.
