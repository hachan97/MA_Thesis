Mr. Tafrov (Bulgaria) (spoke in French): First I
would like to thank Mr. Oshima for his extremely
useful briefing, which is consonant with Bulgaria's
conclusions about the humanitarian situation in
Angola, which remains disturbing in spite of progress
in the political process, which gives cause for
optimism.

I do not want to repeat the comments made by
others, but I would like to stress the importance of the
problem of demining in Angola, which seems to us
essential before tackling the other problems.

In his briefing, Mr. Oshima mentioned certain
steps the Angolan Government, which is doing its best
to respond to the needs of the population, has taken to
facilitate the work of the United Nations and its
humanitarian agencies. Here I wish to thank the Office
for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the
World Food Programme in particular, as well as a large
number of other international humanitarian
organizations that are doing remarkable work in
Angola.

First, regarding infrastructure, which remains
greatly damaged by years of war, I wonder whether
Mr. Oshima could say something about projects that
are important for the delivery of humanitarian
assistance, in which the Angolan Government could be
encouraged to assist in order to make speedy progress.
I wonder whether the United Nations is working with
the Angolan Government to help it better manage its
relationships with international humanitarian
organizations, particularly with regard to customs
clearance for humanitarian deliveries and simplifying
visa requirements.
