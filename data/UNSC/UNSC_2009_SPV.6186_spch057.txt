Mr. Annabi: I thank you again, Madam
President, for having organized this very useful open
09-50519
debate. We very much appreciate the strong support
publicly expressed this afternoon by members of the
Security Council and many other Member States for
the work of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in
Haiti (MINUSTAH), for the Secretary-General's
recommendations and for the initiatives of President
Clinton in his capacity as Special Envoy. It will
encourage me and my colleagues in the field to
redouble our efforts to implement our mandate and to
work with our Haitian colleagues, friends and partners
to consolidate stability in the country and to assist in
putting Haiti on a durable development track.

I believe that what we have heard today from
Prime Minister Michele Pierre-Louis underscores the
determination of the Haitian leadership to move
resolutely in that direction. I want to thank her for her
presence here today, despite her many other
obligations, and I want to assure her that we will
continue to do our best to support her efforts.

Finally, I would like to place on record our
appreciation for the excellent support provided by our
troop and police contributors. I would like in particular
to thank the Latin American countries for their major
contribution to our military component and for their
growing contribution to our police component.
