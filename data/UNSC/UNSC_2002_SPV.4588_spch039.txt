Mr. Motomura (Japan): Thank you, Mr.
President, for convening this open meeting of the
Security Council on the situation in the Middle East.
The Government of Japan deplores the Israeli air strike
in Gaza City on 23 July, which resulted in many
civilian casualties, including children. We express our
deep condolences to the bereaved families and heartfelt
sympathy to those injured. This latest attack by the
Israeli defence forces has intensified hatred among
Palestinian people towards Israel and exacerbated an
already desperate situation.

It is particularly regrettable that this action was
undertaken at a time when the international community
is making concerted efforts to end violence and bring
peace to the region. The Japanese Government again
urges both the Israelis and the Palestinians to break the
vicious cycle of violence. We urge Israel, in particular,
to exercise maximum self restraint.

This tragic incident underscores the urgent need
to push the peace process forward in order to realize
the vision of two States living side by side in peace and
security, as affirmed by Security Council resolution
1397 (2002). It is essential that the two parties, with
the support and assistance of the international
community, make every possible effort to achieve this
goal.

The Government of Japan, for its part, is prepared
to play an active role in various aspects of the process,
including in the new international task force on
Palestinian reform.
