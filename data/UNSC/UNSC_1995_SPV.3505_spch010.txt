Mr. Merimee (France) (interpretation from French):
My country deeply deplores the difficulties currently being
experienced in the peace process, and which have led the
Palestinians, supported by the Arab League, to request the
Security Council to take up the question of the settlements
in the occupied territories. At this meeting, my delegation
will have the opportunity to set out the position of the

 

European Union concerning the present situation in the
occupied territories and the conclusions we draw from it.

I should therefore like at this point to stress the need
for the parties involved to avoid any action which might
harm the cause of peace. This is why it is clear to my
Government that continuing the expansion of the Israeli
settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem - which
ignores article 49 of the Geneva Convention of
12 August 1949 - runs counter to the spirit of the Oslo
Agreements and is therefore contributing to the
difficulties now being encountered in the peace process.
France therefore encourages the Israeli Government,
within the framework of its commitment to peace and of
the decision of principle it took long ago, to find a way
to halt the work on expanding the settlements, which is
being carried out by private interests and with private
financing.

We understand that Israeli public opinion,
understandably traumatized by the resurgence of
terrorism, sometimes doubts the choice made at Oslo.
That is why we call on the Palestinian Authority to do all
it can, within the framework of the responsibilities
entrusted to it, to prevent and to punish such acts.

Experience has shown that the problems of the peace
process cannot be resolved by slowing that process or
calling its validity into question. Rather, it was through
agreement to move forward that Arab and Israeli leaders
began, often in a striking way, to build peace together.
