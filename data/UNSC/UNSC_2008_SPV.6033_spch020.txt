Mr. Lajeak: I would like to thank you,
Mr. President, and all members of the Security Council
for the attention to the situation in Bosnia and
Herzegovina and for the statements in support of our
mission there.

I would like to stress two things. The first is the
need for compromise and consensus among the three
constituent peoples if Bosnia and Herzegovina is to
move forward. Secondly - to repeat once again - the
international community must support all the
domestically led initiatives and honour the principle of
ownership.

Our priorities - "our" means the international
community and myself - for the period ahead will be,
first, to complete our work plan as it was defined by
the Steering Board of the Peace Implementation
Council in February this year, and second, what is
equally important is to decide when is the right time to
redefine our presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina and
20
to offer a greater role to the European Union. As I said,
that is the joint responsibility of the international
community. The best way for the local authorities to
contribute to that is to behave in a mature way and to
demonstrate that they are ready to be our partners
rather than our opponents in this process.

In our efforts I also count on the continuous
attention and support of the United Nations and its
Security Council, and I would like to thank you for that
in advance.

Finally, let me wish the Council a lot of success
in implementing your very responsible mandate.
