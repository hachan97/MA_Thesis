Mr. Gillerman (Israel): First, let me express my
appreciation for the statements made by Syria and Iran.
At a time when terror looms as the major threat to
civilization as we know it, I am sure we all feel
privileged to be lectured on terror by the two worst
major experts on and practitioners of this craft.

It was also refreshing to hear the representative of
Syria rewrite history and reality in conformity with his
usual practice. Syria, the host country to the Olympics
of terror, cannot make a mockery of the Council by
preaching peace in the morning and hosting, financing,
perpetrating and practicing terror in the afternoon. The
assassins of Damascus, still under investigation by the
Council, cannot fool us by wearing the mask of peace-
seekers, while hiding their real face of death and terror.

As for Iran - a fundamentalist, extreme and
reactionary regime led by a ranting President who
denies the Holocaust while preparing the next one and
who openly calls for wiping a Member State of the
United Nations off the map - it was surrealistic to
34

hear its representative, a representative of that terrorist
State that initiated the crisis in Lebanon through its
hired killers, the Hizbollah, decry the fate of Lebanon,
a country taken hostage by Iran and devastated by its
actions. I thank the Iranian representative for
demonstrating yet again to the Council in no uncertain
terms why that dangerous regime must be stopped
before it is too late.
