The President: I thank Mr. Hassan Bubacar
Jallow, Prosecutor of the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda, for the clarifications he has
provided.

I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of
the members of the Security Council to thank Judge
Meron, Judge Mose, ICTY Prosecutor Del Ponte and
ICTR Prosecutor I allow for taking the time to brief the
Security Council.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 5 p.m.
