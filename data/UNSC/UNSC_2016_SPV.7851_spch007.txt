Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): In
recent years, the overall security situation in Liberia has
remained stable. Economic development has resumed
and the Liberian Government, under the leadership of
President Johnson-Sirleaf, has made positive efforts in
maintaining stability and economic development. China
appreciates the efforts made in that regard and calls on
the international community to continue to provide
assistance to Liberia. China has always believed that
United Nations peacekeeping operations should make
adjustments in the light of the actual conditions and
developments on the ground until their final exit. In the
process, the will of the affected country must be fully
respected and consultations with regional countries and
regional and subregional organizations strengthened.

Over the years, the United Nations Mission in
Liberia (UNMIL) has played a significant role in
maintaining peace and stability in Liberia. China
supports the continued presence of UNMIL in Liberia
in an appropriate form. It continues to support Liberia in
stabilizing its situation and to assist it in strengthening
its capacity-building for the military, police and
security sectors so as to ensure the smooth process of
general elections and preserve the hard-earned peace
dividends. Given those considerations, China voted
in favour of resolution 2333 (2016). China will work
with the international community and continue to play
a positive and constructive role in promoting peace,
stability and development in Liberia.
