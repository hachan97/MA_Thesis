Mr. Hoxhaj: Let me be brief with my remarks,
without taking a lot of the Council's time.

Let me be clear that the Government of the
Republic of Kosovo is very much interested in
cooperating fully with the European Union Rule of
Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX). We think that
EULEX has the professional capacity and enough
people - more than 1,600 - with whom we can
cooperate in order for all the allegations made by
Mr. Marty to be investigated. At the same time, it is
very important to us that those allegations be
investigated as soon as possible, as our country needs
to have clarity on this issue.

Secondly, I would like to inform the Council -
and here I can speak from my own experience - that
during the Vienna talks of 2005-2007, we were able to
develop, in the Ahtisaari plan, the best provisions and
mechanisms for the protection of cultural heritage.
That cultural heritage has been protected for all time
by the people living there - Albanians, Serbs, Turks,
Bosniaks and other communities 4 and it will always
be protected.

At the same time, I would like to inform the
Council that the Ahtisaari plan today has been more
than 80 per cent implemented. Pursuant to the Ahtisaari
plan, new municipalities have been created that are
providing Kosovar Serbs with the best way to
accommodate their own interests and priorities.
Perhaps the reason that Mr. Jeremie described the
situation as he did in his feedback is because he has
never visited the country, and he is describes a
situation that does not exist and that never existed.
