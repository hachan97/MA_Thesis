Mr. Bamba (Cote d'Ivoire) (spoke in French):
Like all States represented here, Cote d'Ivoire
welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 1981
(2001). My delegation stresses that Cote d'Ivoire is in
transition and gradually emerging from the recent
crisis. The security situation remains volatile,
particularly in the western part of the country, and must
be strengthened. We call on the Security Council to act
pragmatically and flexibly in allocating resources,
particularly military.
