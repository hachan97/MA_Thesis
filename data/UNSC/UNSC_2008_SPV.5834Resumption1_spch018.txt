Mr. Rosselli (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): My
delegation is pleased to address the Council today
under your presidency, the presidency of a very able
representative of our brother country, Panama. We also
welcome the presence here today of the Vice-President
and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Panama,
Mr. Samuel Lewis-Navarro. This demonstrates
Panama's commitment to the activities of the United
Nations and in particular, those of the Security
Council.

My delegation has high regard for the open
debates of the Security Council. We feel this is a way
for those of us who are not members to draw closer to
this very important central organ of the United Nations.
My delegation has stated previously that,
unfortunately, meetings of this kind often coincide with
very important activities requiring the presence my
colleagues, the Permanent Representatives of Council
members.

Looking around the Chamber now, see that,
except for the Permanent Representative of Indonesia
and you, Mr. President, there are no other Permanent
Representatives of Council members here. Nor are
there any Deputy Permanent Representatives. It is a
shame that the Security Council should hold such
meetings when members are so busy that they cannot
be here to hear their peers. I, too, have a number of
other activities on my agenda and so I will be asking
my colleague, Uruguay's expert on the Third
Committee, to present my country's statement. I bid
you good afternoon, Sir.
