Mr. Annabi: There were no specific questions
addressed to me, but since I have the floor, let me take
the opportunity to thank members of the Council for
the support they have expressed to UNMIK in its
efforts to ensure the implementation of its mandate in
general and to uphold the rule of law in particular. I am
sure that this support will be very much appreciated by
our colleagues in UNMIK at a time when they are
working on the preparation of the municipal elections
scheduled for next month.

Let me thank you, Mr. President, for having
organized this meeting.
