Mr. Gusmao (Timor-Leste): I wish to thank the
members of the Council once again for their interest,
concern and help. I very much appreciate the
statements made by all members. We will take your
words back to our country and we will make every
effort to do what the Council asks of us.

We remain committed to working together with
the international community. We will meet and work
together because this is actually a critical phase of the
transition. As members of the Council have recalled,
we will hold elections next year. We want them to take
place. We are committed to carrying out fair elections.
We know that our elections will not just be something
for us alone. They will also be of importance to many
other countries that are in the same situation or are
about to start this process.

On behalf of the people of Timor-Leste, I would
like very much to thank all the members of the
Security Council, as well as the representatives of
Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the European Union
and the Philippines, for their help and concern, but
especially for their solidarity and generosity.
