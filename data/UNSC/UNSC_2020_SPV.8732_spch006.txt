Mr. Syihab (Indonesia): The delegation of Indonesia is pleased that the Security Council has adopted resolution 2511 (2020). We would like to thank the penholder, the United Kingdom, for its work and diligence, and other Council members for their flexibility and commitment. Through the adoption of this resolution, we recognize the situation on the ground and the need to do something about it. We have shown our dissatisfaction at the mistrust between the parties, which is blocking progress towards dialogue. By this resolution we have demonstrated that the escalation of violence in Yemen, the indefensible deaths of and hunger experienced by children and women, the complicated challenges confronting humanitarian operations and the sexual violence in armed conflict are all unacceptable. The Council is charged with responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. This means that the challenge of saving lives falls to us, as does the monitoring of any violation of international humanitarian law during conflict. My delegation is fully convinced that under the current circumstances, sanctions are necessary to support the peace process and the efforts of the Special Envoy to advance the political process. For Indonesia, the sanctions are justified by the violence and the military operations. Furthermore, those who hinder the peace process or violate international humanitarian law must be held accountable. Finally, Indonesia is pleased that members of the Council, in the best interests of the people of Yemen, were able to adopt the resolution. This was never for any of us; this was for the people of Yemen. They need to know that the Security Council is on their side and to trust that we are trying our best to put an end to their suffering.
