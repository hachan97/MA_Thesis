President Ortega:

"Our Organization should promote respect, peace,
sovereign security, justice and solidarity among
human beings. The Organization must respond
in the face of that barbaric intervention in and
interruption of the tranquillity and the right to
prosperity in the lives of millions of families of
countries and entire populations" (ibid., p. 11).

It is our responsibility to put an end to that threat.
