The President: I thank Mr. Koncke for his briefing.
We certainly appreciate the time he has taken to come
to brief the Council on the situation in Nicaragua. We
also appreciate the Organization of American States
getting involved and taking charge of something that
is happening in the region that we view with concern.

I now give the floor to Mr. Maradiaga.
