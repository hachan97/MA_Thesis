Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation voted in favour of
resolution 2263 (2016), on extending the mandate of
the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus,
which plays an important role in the maintenance of
peace and tranquillity on the island. We are in favour of
intercommunity relations and negotiations.

However, we note that the document is seriously
flawed because the sponsors of the resolution did not
heed the opinions of a number of Security Council
members, failing to reflect in the text an obvious
fact, namely, that beyond the presence in Cyprus
of the two Cypriot communities, there is also one
additional player - Turkey - which maintains an
enormous military presence on the island and whose
true relationship with the settlement of the Cyprus
issue is still not clear. This is attested to, for example,
by the fact that the Turkish air force regularly violates
Cypriot air space. We are convinced that such actions
have a negative impact on the atmosphere in which the
negotiations are taking place, harm civil aviation in the
region and should be curtailed.

We are in favour of the Cypriot parties finding a
negotiated solution that is in line with the purposes
and principles of the Charter of the United Nations
and the provisions of the Security Council resolutions
and which would respond to contemporary geopolitical
realities. In that context, we note that the existing
security mechanisms, namely, systems of external
guarantees for Cyprus, are a relic of the colonial era
and have no place in the twenty-first century.
