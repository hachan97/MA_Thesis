Ms. Meitzad (Israel): Allow me to comment on
some of the statements that were heard earlier today.

The Iranian representative is under the assumption
that his baseless allegation will somehow divert the
Security Council's attention from his regime's deadly
policies and activities. Iran is engaged in a campaign of
aggression in and beyond the Middle East. It backs and
assists the Al-Assad regime, which continues to kill
hundreds of thousands of Syrians, including through the
use of the world's most despicable means - chemical
weapons. It fuels some of the worst conflicts in our
world today in Yemen and elsewhere. Wherever there
is terror, there is Iran. Iran can say all it wants in the
Council, but there will never be enough words to mask
Iran's true identity. Iran is the world's first and main
sponsor of terror, in both words and deeds.

As for the Lebanese Ambassador, who spoke
of justice and gave advice, what exactly is justice?
Where is justice in the conditions which Palestinians
and Syrians endure in Lebanon under the country's
discriminatory legislation? And on what grounds
does he have the authority to give advice? Is it on the
ground of having a Government that is controlled by a
designated terrorist organization and the moral basis of
following policies created by Hizbullah operatives? To
those countries, I would recommend taking a long look
in the mirror before taking the floor, and especially
before attempting to advise others.

The meeting rose at 3.30pm.
