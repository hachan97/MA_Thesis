Mr. Bessho (Japan): Japan is deeply concerned
about the current stagnation in the peace process and
alarmed that a two-State solution may be slipping from
our reach. We have been consistent in our position that
settlement activity is in violation of international law
and that it has been steadily eroding the viability of a
two-State solution. With that in mind, Japan voted in
favour of resolution 2334 (2016).

It is important that the parties commit themselves
to the resolutionjust adopted so as to make meaningful
progress in the Middle East peace process. The Council
also must reaffirm its commitment to a two-State
solution and support the parties to that end. Japan
remains firm in its belief that peace in the region can
be realized only through negotiations and will not
recognize any unilateral change by either party that
may prejudge the final resolution.

I would like to conclude by stressing that Japan will
continue to engage in this matter both in and out of the
Council in order to facilitate the peace process with a
view to achieving a two-State solution.
