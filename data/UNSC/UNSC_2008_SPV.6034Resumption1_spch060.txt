Mr. Escalona Ojeda (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): We listened to the
statement of the representative of the United States
concerning the case of Luis Posada Carriles. It is a
very simple case. Mr. Posada Carriles has declared his
responsibility for terrorist acts, as reflected even in the
United States press. Furthermore, Mr. Posada Carriles
is a fugitive from Venezuelan justice and Venezuela has
requested the United States to extradite him. Those
requests should be heard.

The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has also
announced its readiness to enter into dialogue with the
Government of the United States at the very highest
level in order to normalize our relations. That is
necessary immediately if we are to find a way to solve
all these issues through dialogue and direct
discussions. There is only one condition to that end:
respect for the sovereignty of the Government and
people of Venezuela. With that single condition
satisfied, along with respect for the sovereignty of all
peoples, I am convinced that we will find a path to
peace, dialogue and understanding.
