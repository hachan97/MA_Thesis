The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like to
inform the Council that l have received a letter from the
representative of Sierra Leone, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Kamara (Sierra Leone) took a seat at the Council table.

The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now continue its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Security Council have before them the
same documents considered at the 4098th meeting.
Members of the Council also have before them document
S/2000/34, which contains the text of a draft resolution
prepared in the course of the Council's prior consultations.

I should also like to draw the attention of the members
of the Council to document S/2000/31, containing the text
of a letter dated 17 January 2000 addressed to the President
of the Security Council from the Minister for Foreign
Affairs and International Cooperation of Sierra Leone,
endorsing the recommendations of the Secretary-General
contained in his second report.

I give the floor to the representative of Sierra Leone.
