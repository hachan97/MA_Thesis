Mr. Ndong Mba (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in Spanish): I would like to begin by extending our sincere
congratulations to you, Mr. President, for the successful
way in which have presided over the Security Council
during the month of May.

We must all agree that since last year there has
been an active effort made towards achieving peace
in South Sudan through dialogue, the political will of
the parties concerned and, above all, the intermediary
efforts of Uganda, the Intergovernmental Authority on
Development, the African Union and even His Holiness
Pope Francis.

Given that effort, my delegation believes that
extending the embargo and adopting further sanctions
are not the right steps to motivate those involved to
continue their efforts towards achieving peace. That is
why we abstained in the voting. Although we support
the sanctions in some aspects, we must know when
to impose them and when not to. We need to give the
political stakeholders in South Sudan an opportunity to
continue their efforts to achieve peace through peaceful
means and dialogue.

Lastly, I would like to draw the attention of the
Council to the fact that arms embargoes are often to
the detriment of Governments, and eventually lead to
a situation in which the armed groups are better armed
and equipped than the Government forces. We have
concrete examples of that. We all know and understand
that very well because armed groups illegally import
weapons, while our focus is on controlling the
Governments. They are therefore left without weapons,
while the armed groups - the terrorists - prevail. The
situation that we are experiencing is clear, and we know
that today some armed groups are much better armed
than Governments. We therefore need to pay close
attention to that kind of situation.
