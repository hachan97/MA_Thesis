Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation shares the growing
concern about the problem of the illegal trade in
small arms and light weapons. We believe that
combating it requires a coordinated effort on the part
of the international community while at the same time
maintaining the central role of the United Nations.
However, the Russian Federation abstained in the
voting on today's resolution on small arms and light
weapons (resolution 2220 (2015)), and we would like to
explain our reasons.

We firmly believe that strengthening national
controls in this area would enable us to significantly
reduce the risk of the uncontrolled proliferation of such
weapons. That was why during the work on the text of
the resolution we proposed adding a number of concrete
measures, including a ban on deliveries of small arms
and light weapons to unauthorized entities in recipient
States, the strict regulation of brokering activities and
a ban on the unauthorized re-export of arms and on the
production of pirated weapons manufactured without
licences or under expired licences. Our amendments
were not included.

The resolution includes a number of questionable
provisions relating to the expansion of the power of
specialized committees and missions of the United
Nations concerning issues of control over transfers
of small arms and light weapons. In our View, the
primary responsibility for carrying out those functions
within national territorial frontiers should lie with the
Government concerned.
