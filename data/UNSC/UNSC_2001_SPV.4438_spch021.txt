The President (spoke in French): I thank the
representative of Israel for his kind words addressed to
me.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
Chairman of the Committee on the Exercise of the
Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, Mr. Papa
Louis Fall. I invite him to take a seat at the Council
table and to make his statement.
