Mr. Barro (Senegal) (spoke in French): Senegal
welcomes the adoption of resolution 2352 (2017),
extending the mandate of the United Nations Interim
Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA). We thank the
members of the Security Council, in particular the
penholding delegation and the troop-contributing
countries, for their flexibility, which made it possible
to achieve this dynamic compromise.

Senegal decided to join in the renewal of the
UNISFA mandate, including its operational support
for the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring
Mechanism, because we are deeply convinced of the
need for a united approach of the Security Council to
managing relations between the Sudan and South Sudan,
underpinned by our determination to work side by side
with the two countries in the search for lasting stability
and peace. To that end, in implementing the relevant
agreements between the two countries, we appeal to the
Governments ofthe Sudan and South Sudan to establish
provisional arrangements for the administration and
security of the Abyei area and agreements on border
security, in particular the Agreement on the Border
Monitoring Support Mission.

In the context, we need all possible guarantees
in order to prevent tensions that could compromise
the stability that has been achieved. The scope of the
challenge requires the Security Council to remain
continuously vigilant and united, and to cooperate
fully with the organizations and countries of the region,
which have a very important role to play. In that regard,
my delegation is convinced that we must engage in and
maintain a dynamic and constructive dialogue with the
troop-contributing countries.
