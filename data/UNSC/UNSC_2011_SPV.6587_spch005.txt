The President: I thank Mr. Steiner for his
briefing.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers
to limit their statements to no more than four minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Longer versions of statements may of
course be distributed in writing.

I now give the floor to the members of the
Security Council who wish to make statements.
