Ms. King (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines): Our decision to vote in favour of resolution 2504 (2020) was driven by a deep sense of urgency to provide much- needed humanitarian support to the Syrian people. There are no perfect solutions regarding this complex matter of competing concerns and interests. That calls for acute judgment in all circumstances. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines therefore embraces that option for the sake of human dignity. Yesterday, we all expressed our commitment to multilateral diplomacy and cooperation (see S/PV.8699). We see that commitment in action today as we have been able to find common ground on this very important issue. We also look forward to the Secretary-General's report by the end of February. We remain in favour of optimal arrangements for access so that we do not leave a single person without access to basic needs. It would be remiss of me not to commend the efforts of Germany and Belgium, the co-penholders, as well as Kuwait, even though it is no longer a member of the Security Council, in facilitating and encouraging the discussions on this important matter. The negotiation process was indeed complex but we admire their commitment and perseverance.
