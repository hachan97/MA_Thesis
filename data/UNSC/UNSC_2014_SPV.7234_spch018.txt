Mr. Gombo (Chad) (spoke in French): I would like
to start by thanking Mr. John Ging of the the Office
for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for his
briefing.
The intense clashes between Ukrainian forces and
separatists in eastern Ukraine is occurring in urban
centres, with civilians caught in the crossfire. Many
civilians have been killed or wounded recently. Certain
sources refer to the use of Grad rockets in inhabited
areas, which is a serious crime. Civilians continue to
flee in large numbers and those who remain have to face
various shortages and violations. Health centres and
hospitals in Donetsk and Slavyansk have been occupied,
preventing civilians from receiving treatment. We call
upon both sides to respect the norms of international
humanitarian law. Attacks and reprisals risk worsening
the situation, which will no doubt have a negative
impact on the civilian population.

In conclusion, we are convinced that only an
inclusive and constructive dialogue could lead us to
an unfreezing of the situation that Ukraine is currently
experiencing. Ukrainians have the right to peace just
like all the other peoples of the world.
