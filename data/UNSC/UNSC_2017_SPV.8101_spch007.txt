Mr. Malwal (South Sudan): Allow me at the onset
to congratulate you, Sir, upon your assumption of your
duties as President of the Security Council for the
month of November. I assure you of our delegation's
support and cooperation.

I would also like to extend the appreciation of our
delegation to the members of the Security Council for
the effort and time they put into negotiating the text of
resolution 2386 (2017), adopted today, and welcome the
extension of the mandate of the United Nations Interim
Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA). Our appreciation
also goes to the Department ofPeacekeeping Operations
for its tireless assistance to UNISFA in the fulfilment
of its mandate.

Lastly, I would like to pay tribute to the men
and women of the Ethiopian armed forces, who have
demonstrated their dedication to the people of Abyei
despite the challenges they are facing.

This extension comes at the time when the Republic
of South Sudan and the Republic of the Sudan, through
their leaderships, have renewed their resolve to

solve any outstanding differences within the agreed
established channeled.

In conclusion, it is our hope that through the
extension ofthis mandate, the people ofAbyei will enjoy
greater peace and security as a permanent settlement is
sought under the auspices of the African Union High-

Level Implementation Panel.

The meeting rose at 10.25 61.111.
