Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the
outset, I would like to congratulate Togo on assuming
the presidency of the Security Council, and to express
appreciation to the presidency of the Council for the
organization of this debate on the important issue of
the impact of transnational organized crime on peace,
security and stability in West Africa and the Sahel
region. I also welcome the presence here this morning
of His Excellency President Faure Essozimna
Gnassingbe of Togo to preside personally over this
debate. I would also like to express my appreciation to
the Secretary-General for his participation and his
valuable contributions, as well as to the Executive
Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and
Crime.

There is no doubt that the activities of
transnational organized crime networks have serious

implications for peace and security in Africa, and for
West Africa and the Sahel region in particular. In turn,
that affects international peace and security in general.
Those activities therefore need to be addressed in order
that they do not lead to a reversal in the progress made
in consolidating peace and stability in the African
continent.

In spite of what is highlighted in the report of the
Secretary-General on the causes of conflicts in Africa
with regard to the significant reduction in the number
of African countries engaged in armed conflicts -
from 14 countries in the late 19905 to only just four
countries today, which underlines the deep
commitment of African Governments and peoples to
the cause of peace, stability and development - many
African countries are still unable to fulfil the
developmental aspirations of their peoples, including
the achievement of the internationally agreed
development goals, particularly the Millennium
Development Goals, where Africa still lags behind
other regions in terms of rates of progress.

In addition, there is the growing impact of a
group of emerging challenges to the efforts of African
countries to achieve peace and development, notably
those related to terrorism, acts of piracy and armed
robbery at sea and transnational organized crime,
including trafficking in persons, illicit drug trafficking
and the smuggling of small arms. The seriousness of
those challenges in West Africa and the Sahel region
were demonstrated by the negative effects of the
terrorist acts experienced by a number of countries in
the region, as well as acts of piracy and armed robbery
in the Gulf of Guinea, on the economic, social and
humanitarian situations in those countries.

In that regard, Egypt remains deeply concerned
about the terrorist threats posed by Al-Qaida in the
Islamic Maghreb to the Sahel region in particular, and
in West Africa in general. We emphasize the dire need
to effectively address the terrorist threat through a
comprehensive subregional counter-terrorism action
plan supported by the United Nations that includes a
capacity-building component so as to strengthen the
limited security capacities and infrastructure of the
countries in the region, including breaking any links
between the terrorist group of Boko Haram in West
Africa and Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, as well as
enhancing the capacity to prevent terrorists from
organizing terrorist acts and moving freely across the
borders of States in this region, through the
implementation of effective measures of law
enforcement and border control and the monitoring of
coastal and inland areas. In that context, Egypt
reaffirms its readiness to contribute effectively to the
counter-terrorism efforts made by the countries of the
region, especially through the provision of training for
security and law-enforcement forces, as well as
through the exchange of experiences, lessons learned
and best practices.

The countries of West Africa and the Sahel region
have made a number of efforts at the national and
regional levels to address those challenges, including
through the conclusion of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) Convention on Small
Arms and Light Weapons, Their Ammunition, and
Other Related Materials, which entered into force in
November 2009; the ECOWAS Regional Action Plan
to Address the Growing Problem of Illicit Drug
Trafficking, Organized Crime and Drug Abuse in West
Africa; and the African Union Plan of Action on Drug
Control and Crime Prevention. However, the weak
institutional capacity of the countries of the region in
general and the economic and social challenges faced
by those countries, in particular the high levels of
poverty and unemployment, and the weakness of
international assistance have had a negative impact on
the outcome of those regional efforts.

Egypt believes that addressing the challenges
associated with the activities of transnational organized
crime networks requires coordinated action at the
regional and international levels. Such action should
take into consideration the direct link that exists
between the fight against transnational organized crime
in West Africa and the Sahel region, and the
peacebuilding efforts under way in a number of
countries in the region, as many of those countries face
enormous challenges related to the weak capacity of
their rule-of-law institutions and their limited ability to
control their borders. Those challenges contribute to
the creation of a breeding ground for the activities of
organized crime networks, whose activities -
especially through their financial revenues - in turn
further weaken State authority and institutional
capacity.

For all of those reasons, we need to work
collectively to break the vicious circle of low
institutional capacity and the rising threat of
transnational organized crime.

In that regard, Egypt welcomes the initiatives
aimed at including the combat against organized crime
in the work of the United Nations Integrated
Peacebuilding Offices in many countries in the region,
as well as at integrating the task of strengthening the
capacity of national security institutions into the
mandate of peacekeeping operations in Africa, taking
into consideration the issue of the national ownership
of reform and institutional capacity-building processes.

On the other hand, it should be stressed that a
comprehensive approach to the issue of transnational
organized crime - which has such strong
repercussions on peace, security and stability in West
Africa and the Sahel region - should not be limited
only to strengthening the institutional capacity of the
countries of the region in the field of border control
and law enforcement. It should also include, on the
basis of the close interlinkages between peace, stability
and development, support for the efforts made by the
countries of the region to address the economic, social
and humanitarian challenges facing them, including job
creation, especially for young people.

Finally, Egypt stresses that the support of the
international community and the United Nations
system - in particular through the activities of the
Peacebuilding Commission, the United Nations Office
on Drugs and Crime, the United Nations Office in West
Africa and others - must be focused on building the
capacity of regional mechanisms, support for border
control and the exchange of information on
transnational organized crime, including small-arms
smuggling, illicit drug trafficking and trafficking in
persons. It must also focus on the mobilization of
broader international support for the countries of West
Africa and the Sahel region, with a view to addressing
the root causes of instability.
