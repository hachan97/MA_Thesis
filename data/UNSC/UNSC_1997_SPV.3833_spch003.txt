The President (interpretation from Chinese): I thank
the representative of Tajikistan for his kind words
addressed to me.

It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless I
hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the
vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements before the voting.
