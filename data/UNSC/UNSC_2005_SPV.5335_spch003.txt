Mr. Mayoral (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): My
delegation was very constructive throughout the entire
negotiating process on the establishment of the
Commission, which we have just approved. In that
connection, my delegation reiterates its support for the
Commission. We trust that it will be a positive body
that will be able to resolve post-conflict problems.

Nevertheless, the inclusion of members of the
Security Council in the composition of the
Peacebuilding Commission as established in resolution
1646 (2005) was something we could not support,
given that my country, Argentina, has since the
establishment of the Organization defended the
hallmark principle of the legal equality of States and
has opposed the creation of privileges.
