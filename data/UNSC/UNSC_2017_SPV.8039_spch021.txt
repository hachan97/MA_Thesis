Mrs. Haley (United States of America): Due to the
urgency of the situation concerning the nuclear test,
as well as the announcement by North Korea that it is
planning another intercontinental ballistic missile test,
we urge the Security Council to move very quickly on
this. I think that North Korea basically has slapped
everyone in the face in the international community
that has asked it to stop. The United States delegation
therefore will circulate a draft resolution that it would
like to negotiate this week and vote on on Monday. Ijust
wanted to let the members of the Council know. I know
that some are going on mission to Addis Ababa, but we
wanted to make sure that we will do that on Monday
when we will be able to finalize those negotiations.

The meeting rose at11.30 a.m.
