The President (spoke in French): I thank
Mr. J allow for his kind words and for the clarifications
he has provided.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

1 would like to take this opportunity once again to
express my thanks, on behalf of the Council, to Judge
Pocar and Judge Byron and to the Prosecutors, Ms. Del
Ponte and Mr. Jallow, for their briefings to the Council.

The meeting rose at 1.50 pm.
