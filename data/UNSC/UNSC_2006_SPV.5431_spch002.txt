Mr. Bolton (United States of America): The
United States voted in favour of the resolution in the
hope that parties will use the next six months to make
real progress towards reaching a mutually acceptable
solution that brings peace, stability and economic
prosperity to the region in a manner consistent with the
principle of self-determination for the people of
Western Sahara.

We recognize the important role of the United
Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara
in those efforts, but we must continually monitor the
ability of the Mission to carry out its mandated tasks,
taking into account limited peacekeeping resources.

The United States looks forward to the next
report of the Secretary-General prior to the end of the
current mandate period, and hopes that the parties will
have begun to take meaningful steps towards a final
resolution of the dispute.

The settlement of the Western Sahara conflict
would enhance the stability and economic prosperity of
the Maghreb. Unresolved, the conflict and
humanitarian crisis continue to be the primary
impediments to regional integration and development.
The United States cannot impose a solution, but
together we can continue to urge the parties to work
together and with the United Nations in a spirit of
flexibility and compromise. Morocco has
expressed its intention to put forward an autonomy
plan for the territory, and we encourage it to submit a
plan that is at once strong and credible in the hope that
it might form the basis of a new United Nations-led
negotiating process.

Our hope over the next six months is simple, but,
we hope, not too ambitious. It is that we will see
significant progress towards launching a diplomatic
effort that will allow the parties to move beyond the
status quo in the direction of a final resolution of a
dispute that has already gone on too long.
