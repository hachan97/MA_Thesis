The President (spoke in French): I shall now
make a statement in my national capacity.

As the Secretary-General recalls in his most
recent letters to the Security Council, the Council's
priority task is to stabilize Cote d'Ivoire.
Reinforcements to care d'Ivoire of military helicopters
attached to the United Nations Mission in Liberia
(UNMIL) play an essential role in this. The main
threats of subregional destabilization are now in Cote
d'Ivoire. It is not the Council's job to interfere in the
management of logistical peacekeeping assets by the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations. The Council
has always supported UNMIL, which should continue
to enjoy the resources it needs in the context of the
democratic transition that began four years ago
following the end of a 10-year crisis. In that spirit, on
15 June the Security Council must seize the
opportunity and modalities for cooperation between
UNMIL and the United Nations Operation in Cote
d'Ivoire.

I resume my functions as President of the
Council.

I shall now put the draft resolution to the vote.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
Colombia, France, Gabon, Germany, India,
Lebanon, Nigeria, Portugal, Russian Federation,
South Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland and United States of
America.

The President (spoke in French): There were
15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 1981 (2011).

I call on the representative of Cote d'Ivoire.
