Mr. Granovsky (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): At the outset, we wish to express our
satisfaction that the holding of regular open briefings
on East Timor is becoming part of the Security
Council's customary practice. We believe that this is
fully justified in the light of the situation in the
territory and by the attention being paid to this question
by the international community.

Our assessment of the development of the
situation in East Timor and the activity of the United
Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor
(UNTAET) jibes with the analyses contained in
statements made by members of the Council. In the
interests of saving time, I shall not repeat them. I
should like to add only that, together with the entire
international community, we have followed with
concern reports on the development of the emergency
situation arising from the floods in West Timor. We
express our condolences in connection with the loss of
life and believe that we must express our satisfaction
with the assistance rendered by UNTAET to the
authorities of Indonesia in overcoming the
consequences of that natural disaster.

The activity of the United Nations in East Timor
is a serious test of its effectiveness and potential in
resolving various kinds of problems. We pay due
tribute to the successful efforts of UNTAET, and
personally to the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello.
