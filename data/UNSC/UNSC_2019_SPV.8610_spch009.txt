Mr. Singer Weisinger (Dominican Republic) (spoke in Spanish): The Dominican Republic
recognizes the work and important role performed by
the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)
in contributing to maintaining stability in Lebanon and
the region. We therefore strongly support the renewal
of its mandate for another year. We commend the work
of France in coordinating the negotiations and the spirit
of consensus in the Security Council on the renewal of
the mandate in the light of the prevailing situation and
competing national priorities.

We call on the parties to strengthen their
commitment to complying fully with resolution 1701
(2006), exercise maximum restraint and avoid anything
that may contribute to an escalation of tensions, thereby
consolidating the recent period of relative calm into a
permanent ceasefire that would contribute to regional
stability. We highlight that UNIFIL's capacity to deter,
prevent and reduce tensions remains crucial at this time,
as does the support of the Lebanese Government in full
exercise of its sovereignty and territorial control, while
strengthening its capacities, abilities and presence.

As this is the final public meeting during Poland's
presidency, I would like to congratulate you, Madam
President, on the exemplary manner in which you have
conducted the work of the Security Council throughout
the month of August. You and your team have once again
exhibited the highest standards of professionalism,
transparency and excellence in discharging your
sensitive responsibilities. We therefore express our
thanks and admiration in the strongest possible terms.
