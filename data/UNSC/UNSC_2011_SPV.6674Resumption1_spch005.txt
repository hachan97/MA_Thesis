Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): The
United Kingdom continues to be deeply concerned at
the situation in the Horn of Africa and the threat to
regional and international peace and security. Its
people need our support now more than ever if they are
to achieve a more stable and prosperous region.

The United Kingdom is concerned about Eritrea's
disruptive activities in Somalia and the region, and its
non-compliance with Security Council resolutions, in
particular resolution 1907 (2009). The United Kingdom
therefore welcomes the adoption of resolution 2023
(2011) today and the further measures it applies. We
also note the Council's readiness to consider additional
measures if there is evidence of further
non-compliance. The measures in the resolution are
proportionate, preventative and carefully targeted in
order to prevent humanitarian impact, and we fully
support them.
11-62209

The United Kingdom urges Eritrea to comply
with this and all other Security Council resolutions. We
urge all States of the region to work to resolve conflict,
demarcate borders and work together towards political
solutions that protect civilians and provide an
environment for economic development and regional
integration. Given the impact on civilians of the
devastating drought in the region and the famine in
Somalia, we encourage these States to work together to
deliver peace and security.

As resolution 2023 (2011) makes clear, the
Secretary-General and the Security Council will keep
Eritrea's actions under continuous review, and we shall
be prepared to adjust the measures in the light of
Eritrea's future compliance or non-compliance with
Security Council resolutions.
