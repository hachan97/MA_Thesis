The Secretary-General: I welcome this draft
resolution. It provides a clear, focused and sympathetic way
of honouring fully the memory of those women and men,
military and civilian, including United Nations volunteers,
who have lost their lives in the service of peace on United
Nations peacekeeping operations.

If anything, this recognition of their valour and
sacrifice, in the light of the ever greater challenges that
peacekeepers face, is overdue.

Since the Blue Helmets were awarded the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1988, there have been qualitative and quantitative
changes in United Nations peacekeeping. In 1988, five
United Nations peacekeeping operations were in existence.
Four of them related to inter-State wars, while one
concerned an intra-State conflict. Over the next four years,
21 new operations were established, eight dealing with
inter-State wars and 13 related to intra-State conflicts.

The United Nations peacekeepers were called upon to
perform new tasks. They were put in situations where there
was no peace to keep. They were confronted by a broader
and greater range of risks. They carried out their work with
sensitivity and bravery, but their efforts were not always
fully acknowledged.

There were setbacks. Some people were quick to
criticize. The shrill voices of those who sat in their
armchairs and did nothing but complain that the
peacekeepers were not doing enough became familiar.

More than 750,000 women and men - military,
police and civilians - from 110 countries have taken part
in United Nations peacekeeping over the years. The Dag
Hammarskjold Medal will honour the lives of all those -
more than 1,500 - who went to distant lands in search
of peace and paid the ultimate price while serving under
the United Nations flag.

It will remind us of the sense of duty, bravery and
sacrifice of those women and men. And it will honour,
too, the memory of a Secretary-General who himself lost
his life in the cause of peace.
