Mr. Sall (spoke in French): I would simply like
to add a small note to the statement of the
representative of France, by saying that indeed it has
been some time since we last communicated with his
country, when our Programme noted 12 national
commissions out of 15. We have moved a step forward
since then, with a national commission set up in Benin.
We therefore now count 13 national commissions out
of 15.

As for the functioning of national commissions,
once decrees have been signed by the Presidents of the
Republic, and ministers or heads of Government have
established national commissions, we plan to
immediately make financial resources available so they
can start their activities. Once the documents have been
adopted and executive action has been taken, we plan
to immediately finance the national commissions so
that they may become operational.

A second point that I believe should be
remembered is the final-use certificates. This question
frequently comes up, and there has been the possibility
of falsifying those certificates. Therefore, What I would
like to propose for the coming months in the review in
our programme of activity - we do have joint reviews
carried out by PCASED and ECOWAS - is to have
included on our agenda a review of the end-user
certificate to improve it and make it more reliable to
meet the problems just raised.

Concerning the specific risks in the subregion,
there was a meeting of UNDP resident representatives
no more than a month ago in Dakar, after which the
idea was adopted of carrying out a study on future
security risks in the subregion that would be
coordinated with the representative of the United
Nations Secretary-General in West Africa, Mr. Ould-
Abdallah.

These are all issues that are currently being
addressed, and I am pleased that France put its finger
precisely where needed. I would not say on a sore spot.
