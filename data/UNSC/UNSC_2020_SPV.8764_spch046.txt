The President (spoke in Russian): Before I give the floor to our next speaker, I would like to make two comments. First, in my capacity as President of the Security Council, in response to the comment made by the representative of France that I had exceeded my authority as President, I recall that not only did I not exceed my authority as President; I did not even make full use of it. Had I fully availed myself of my rights, without any prejudice to the rules of procedure, there would have been a different result in the voting on the question at hand. I shall now speak in my national capacity. By this vote we brought disgrace upon ourselves. For the first time in the Security Council, we have voted on the presence of a briefer. This tells us something about the fear among certain members of hearing the truth and their lack of confidence. All of the statements that I have heard today have suggested that. Once again, this is aremark in my national capacity as representative of Russia. I would ask the representative of France to abstain from making recommendations on what I can include in my national statement and what not. Responding to the representative of Estonia, in my national capacity, I should say that we will with great pleasure participate in a meeting with Director General Arias when he next comes to an open briefing of the Security Council, which I hope will happen as soon as next month. I now resume my functions as President of the Council.I give the floor to the representative of the Syrian Arab Republic.
