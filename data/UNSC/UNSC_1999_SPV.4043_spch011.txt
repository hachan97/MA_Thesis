Mr. Qin Huasun (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
popular consultation held in East Timor two weeks ago
provided a historic opportunity for the final settlement of
the issue of East Timor through peaceful means. The
initial decision of the Indonesian Government and its
good cooperation afterwards established conditions for the
realization of that historic opportunity.

 

The people of East Timor have made their choice for
their future. We strongly appeal to all sides concerned to
respect the will of the people of East Timor. In the
meantime, we hope that the various parties in East Timor
will join hands in building a stable and prosperous future
for East Timor.

It is our hope that the result of the popular
consultation will be fully implemented in a peaceful and
orderly environment. We are gravely concerned over the
continuing violence and resulting humanitarian crisis in East
Timor. We demand the immediate cessation of all acts of
violence in East Timor and, in particular, the protection of
United Nations personnel. We hope that measures taken by
the Indonesian Government will achieve the desired results
as soon as possible.

The Chinese delegation appreciates the United Nations
close cooperation with the Indonesian and Portuguese
Governments on East Timor and the efforts made by the
United Nations Mission in East Timor to ensure the smooth
conduct of the popular consultation. According to the
Charter of the United Nations, the Security Council bears
the primary responsibility for the maintenance of
international and regional peace. The issue of East Timor
must be solved through the United Nations. The
deployment of any peacekeeping force should be at the
request of the Indonesian Government and endorsed by the
Security Council. China is willing to be actively involved
in United Nations efforts in this connection.
