The President: I shall now make a statement in my
national capacity.

This particular Security Council will go down in
history. Many questions will have to be answered. Did
Aleppo have to fall in the way in which it has fallen?
Why could we not prevent the massacres? Why were we
not able to organize the evacuation of all the civilians
from eastern Aleppo after months of siege? This is an
emergency meeting of the Security Council, and as
such my statement will be straightforward.

I entirely endorse the call made by the Secretary-
General, and I call upon the Syrian Government and
on those that have acknowledged an influence over the
parties to the conflict to do all they can to facilitate
an agreement providing for the urgent evacuation of
civilians, the withdrawal of the few remaining fighters,
urgent access for humanitarian aid, as well as the
provision of medical assistance to the population.

Aleppo need not fall this way. It is not necessary
that another sombre page of history be written today.
Spain will continue to work closely with New Zealand
and with Egypt to avoid this.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

The representative of the Russian Federation has
asked for the floor to make a further statement.
