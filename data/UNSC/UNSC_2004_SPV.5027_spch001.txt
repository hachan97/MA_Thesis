The President (spoke in Spanish): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Jan Pronk,
Special Representative of the Secretary-General for the
Sudan and head of the peace support operation.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Pronk to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached

Members of the Council have before them the
