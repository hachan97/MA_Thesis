The President (interpretation from French): I shall
now make a statement in my capacity as representative of
France.

In its presidential statements of 1 and 4 May, our
Council demanded in the clearest terms that an end be put
to the armed incursions in the zones of separation in
Croatia.

We note that, in spite of the commitments announced
in this respect by the Croatian authorities, concrete
withdrawal operations on the ground have been partial and
delayed. The latest indications point today to a significant
overall movement, which we welcome. Nonetheless, in
some zones progress has yet to be confirmed.

That is why my delegation voted in favour of
resolution 994 (1995), which demands that a total
withdrawal be completed without further delay. This
demand is also addressed to the Croatian Serb forces
which are still in the zones of separation. The situation
cannot truly be stabilized unless both parties respect the
buffer zones.

In addition, my delegation wishes to recall the
importance of full respect for human rights, which in this
context constitutes an essential element in restoring
confidence between the parties. We also remind the
parties that they must ensure the security and freedom of
movement of United Nations personnel.

Lastly, my delegation trusts that the United Nations
Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia can, as our
resolution stresses it should, be deployed rapidly, and that
it will fulfil the mandate conferred upon it by our Council
in its resolution 981 (1995).

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda. The

Security Council will remain seized of the matter.

The meeting rose at 6.10 p.m.
