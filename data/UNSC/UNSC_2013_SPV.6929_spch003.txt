Mrs. Perceval (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): At
the outset, I would like to convey our most heartfelt
condolences to the family and to the people and
Government of the sisterly Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela on the death of their President, Hugo Chavez
Frias. The ideals of solidarity with the continent that he
embodied are an inspiration for the Latin American and
Caribbean region.

Argentina supported the adoption of resolution
2093 (2013), which is a vote of confidence in the
Government of Somalia given the improvement in
the security situation in that country and its progress
in implementing the road map, establishing the new
Parliament and electing President Mohamud. That
relative progress was achieved under the arms embargo.
We therefore trust that the future acquisition of weapons
by the Federal Government of Somalia does not hamper
the provision of resources necessitated by the complex
and urgent humanitarian situation in Somalia.

Argentina also hopes that the measures for
monitoring the destination and use of weapons provided
for in the resolution are effective, reliable and efficient.
The eyes of the Council and of the entire international
community are on Somalia. We hope and trust that
within a year, when the time comes to consider the
renewal of the partial lifting of the arms embargo, we
will be able to say that we have done the right thing
