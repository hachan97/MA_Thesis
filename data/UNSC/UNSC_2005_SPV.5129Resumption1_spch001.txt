The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the members of the Council that I have received
letters from the representatives of Indonesia, Mali and
Niger, in which they request to be invited to participate
in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda.
In conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with
the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion without
the right to vote, in accordance with relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, the
representatives of the aforementioned countries
took the seats reservedfor them at the side of the
Council Chamber.

The President (spoke in French): I should like to
remind all speakers of what I stated during this
morning's meeting, namely, that they should limit their
statements to no more than five minutes, in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to circulate their texts in writing and to
deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.

I will also not individually invite speakers to take
seats at the Council table or invite them to resume their
seats at the side of the Council Chamber. When a
speaker takes the floor the Conference Officer will seat
the next speaker on my list at the table. I thank
participants for their understanding and cooperation.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Luxembourg, on whom I now call.
