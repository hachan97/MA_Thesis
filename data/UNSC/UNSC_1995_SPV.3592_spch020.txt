Mr. Ayewah (Nigeria): My delegation was touched
by the sensitivity of those who made comments about a
reported incident in my country. However, I would like to
place on record that the Nigerian delegation takes strong
exception to the comments made by certain members of
the Council, led by the British delegation, over a decision
taken, after due process, by the Government of Nigeria in
the exercise of its sovereignty.

 

The Nigerian delegation wishes to remind those
delegations that have ascribed to themselves the role of
the world's policemen to kindly note that what reportedly
took place in Nigeria earlier today. in relation to the
subject of their comments, bears no relevance to the item
under consideration in the Council.

The Nigerian delegation therefore finds it
unacceptable for those members to meddle in Nigeria's
domestic affairs. We regard thi gross interference in
our internal affairs.
