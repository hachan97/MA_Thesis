Mr. Dejammet (France) (interpretation from French): There are subjects, there are tragedies, where
words are too weak to describe the horror and revulsion
that every human being feels when they are described.
The memory of the victims demands restraint.

The report the Security Council requested of the
Secretary-General damningly shows that the atrocities
committed by Bosnian Serb forces were premeditated and
systematic. The massacre of civilian inhabitants of
Srebrenica, the exodus of the population of Zepa, the
suffering of the Muslims and Croats of western Bosnia:
these tragedies cry out for justice. It is the duty of justice
to identify and condemn all those who instigated or
carried out acts contributing to spreading and practising
that ideology of hatred, "ethnic cleansing".

But it is also the duty - and the honour - of the
Council to react swiftly. That is why France took the
initiative last July of submitting the text that was to
become resolution 1004 (1995) when the first alarming
information had only just arrived from Srebrenica. And
that is why France wished, in close coordination with our
German partners, to submit to the Council the draft
resolution that has just been adopted.

 

At a time when a peace plan is coming into force that
we all hope will put an end to four years of suffering and
horror for the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it was
necessary to remind all those responsible - no matter who
they are - for these exactions, whenever and wherever
they might have been committed, that they will not escape
justice.
