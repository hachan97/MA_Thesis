The President: I thank Mr. Sajdik for his briefing. I
think that for him the same holds true as for Mr. Apakan.
This might be one his last briefings, if not the his last
one, to the Security Council. I also thank him for the
work that he has done. I do not know which has been
more difficult - heading a committee at the United
Nations, as he had previously done, or his presentjob.
I now give the floor to those Council members who
wish to make statements.
