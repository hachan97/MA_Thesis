Mr. van Walsum (Netherlands): We have very little
to add to what has been said by delegations that spoke
before us. We are concerned at the ongoing violence in
Burundi. We warmly welcome the designation of Nelson
Mandela as the new Facilitator of the Arusha peace process.
We do not consider the involuntary resettlement or
regroupment of rural populations an acceptable way to
address the security situation in Burundi, but we do believe
that Burundi has the right to be safeguarded from cross-
border attacks by armed insurgents.

The Netherlands has supported the Arusha peace
process in the past. As an expression of our continuing
support, we have decided to contribute another $250,000.
Following a rather gloomy year - as far as progress in the
peace process is concerned - this decision was greatly
facilitated by the appointment of Mr. Mandela as the new
Facilitator.

My delegation has the greatest confidence in Mr.
Mandela. As the first democratically elected President of
South Africa, he personifies everything that is new in
Africa. As such, he seems more qualified than anyone else
to convince the Burundian delegations when he invites
them, as he did in Arusha, to join the modern world.

In conclusion, I join the representatives of Argentina
and Jamaica in calling on the Government of Burundi to
take effective action in identifying, apprehending and
bringing to justice the perpetrators of the murders of United
Nations personnel in Rutana last October.
