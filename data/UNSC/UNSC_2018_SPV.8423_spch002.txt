Mr. Alotaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): Over the
past two weeks, Sweden and Kuwait, as penholders for
the humanitarian aspect of the Council's work on Syria,
have conducted broad consultations with members of
the Security Council and other relevant parties in order
to renew the resolution on humanitarian access to Syria,
including the fundamental provisions of resolution 2165
(2014). Those negotiations and consultations have been
fruitful and helpful. We thank all Council members
for their constructive engagement in the consultations.
Consequently, Sweden and Kuwait have presented to the
Council what they believe to be a purely humanitarian
and balanced draft resolution, which renews cross-
border humanitarian operations for 12 months, in line
with the Secretary-General's recommendation.

The cross-border assistance authorized by
the Security Council remains a vital part of the
humanitarian response. In November alone, life-saving
cross-border humanitarian assistance was provided to
more than 600,000 people, including food assistance to
nearly 500,000. The number of those who are still in
need of humanitarian assistance in Syria is 13 million,
which is a very significant number.

The renewal of the resolution would allow the
Security Council to continue to help ease the human
suffering of the people and ensure delivery by the
shortest route to humanitarian assistance to those in
Syria who need it. Such cross-border humanitarian
assistance continues to complement other mechanisms
of humanitarian response in Syria, where millions of
people depend on cross-border humanitarian assistance
to survive. That is why we call on all Council members
to support the draft resolution and vote in favour of it.
