Mr. Polyanskiy (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I see that the representative of Germany still
reads the New York Times. We long ago turned to more
reliable sources of information and advise him to do
the same.

As we understand it, the board of inquiry is an
internal mechanism of the United Nations. Its report
will be presented to the Secretary-General and
it is for him to decide what to do with it. There are
corresponding procedures that the Secretary-General
has to follow. For the rest of it, the representative of
Germany can listen to our regular reports to the media,
press conferences and so forth. He can rest assured that
they are far more reliable than his sources.
