The President: I congratulate the Permanent
Observer of the League of Arab States to the United
Nations on his comparative brevity.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is Mr. Papa
Louis Fall, Chairman of the Committee on the Exercise
of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People. I
invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to
make his statement.
