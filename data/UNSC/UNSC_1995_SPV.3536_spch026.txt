The President (interpretation from French): I thank
the representative of Lebanon for his kind words
addressed to me.

Because of the lateness of the hour, I propose, with
the consent of the Council, to suspend the meeting.

However, before doing so, I call on the
representative of Palestine, who wishes to speak in
exercise of the right of reply.
