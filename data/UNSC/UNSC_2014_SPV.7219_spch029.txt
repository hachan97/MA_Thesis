Ms. Frankinet (Belgium) (spoke in French): I
would like to thank you, Mr. President, for giving me
the opportunity to participate in this meeting. I would
also like to thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for
his briefing.

On behalf of the Government and the people of
Belgium, I would like first to express my most heartfelt
condolences to the Government of Malaysia, as well
as to the families and friends of the 298 people who
were aboard the Malaysia Airlines plane shot down
in eastern Ukraine. There were five Belgian nationals
among the victims. Our thoughts are with those who
mourn today, in particular the friends and families and
the Government of the Netherlands, a country close to
us.

Like others who preceded me have done, Belgium
launches an appeal to all the parties to guarantee full
access to the disaster site, not only for the search
and rescue teams but also for the investigators. A
full, detailed, thorough and impartial international
investigation should be conducted to determine the
exact circumstances surrounding the MH-17 disaster.

In that regard, Belgium supports the proposal
of Australia that the Security Council adopt a draft
resolution that stresses the need for guaranteed access
to the site and for the conduct of a full, independent
international investigation. We owe it to the victims
and their families, as well as to ourselves, to shed full
light on what happened yesterday in eastern Ukraine.
