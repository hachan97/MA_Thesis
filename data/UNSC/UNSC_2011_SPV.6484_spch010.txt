Mr. Osorio (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): In
noting the results of the voting on the draft resolution
submitted for the Council's consideration, on which
Colombia voted in favour, I would like to reaffirm my
country's conviction that the appropriate path to
achieve a lasting peace between the peoples of Israel
and Palestine and the coexistence of the two States is a
negotiated solution, not hostile confrontation.
We voted in favour of the draft resolution, as we
have done on other occasions on this issue, because we
believe that settlements contravene international law
and do not comply with the agreements under the Road
Map and the negotiations promoted by the Quartet.

We support bilateral, direct negotiations between
Pelestinians and Israelis as the only possible way to
resolve the existing differences. We share the vision of
the creation of two democratic States living in peace
and with defined, recognized and safe borders. We
firmly believe in the need for both parties to act in
keeping with international law and to comply with
their respective commitments and obligations.

For Colombia the fundamental principles in the
peaceful settlement of disputes are the obligation not to
use force in international relations, and the free
determination of peoples. Israelis and Palestinians
cannot continue to be bogged down in confrontation
without confidence. We vigorously call on them to
maintain and intensify the talks between the parties on
the basis of mutual respect and recognition of the
identity and rights of each people. The Palestinians
have the right to their own State that lives in peace
with Israel and progresses toward common prosperity.
