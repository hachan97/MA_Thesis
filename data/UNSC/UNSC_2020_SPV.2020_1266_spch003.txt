Germany welcomes the renewal of the mandate of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011), which will allow the Team to continue its crucial work. The Security Council and the Sanctions Committee rely on the expertise and support of the Monitoring Team. Therefore, Germany voted in favour of resolution 2557 (2020) today. However, Germany is concerned that the amendments to the text contain more than mere technical updates as compared to last year's resolution (resolution 2501 (2019)). To obtain a different result, more time for discussion and reflection would have been required. While we recognize and welcome the important steps made by both sides with the start of the Afghan peace negotiations and the agreement on the rules of procedure, we caution that, unfortunately, the Taliban have not yet ceased to use terrorist tactics and acts as a means of warfare. This link is the reason that the sanctions regime pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011) was first established and must continue to exist. We regret that this is not adequately reflected in resolution 2557 (2020). Germany remains committed to supporting the people of Afghanistan and the peace process, in which we consider the sanctions regime pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011) and its Monitoring Team to play an important role.
