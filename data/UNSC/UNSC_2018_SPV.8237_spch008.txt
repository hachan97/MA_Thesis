Mr. Ma Zhaoxu (China) (spoke in Chinese): At
the outset, I would like to thank High Representative
Nakamitsu for her briefing.

China has been closely following the developments
related to the Salisbury incident since it took place in
the United Kingdom in March. We support addressing
the issue within the framework of the Organization
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)
in accordance with the provisions of the Chemical
Weapons Convention. I wish to reiterate that China
is firmly opposed to the use of chemical weapons
by any State, any organization or any individual
under any circumstances. That is our categorical and
consistent position.

We take note that the OPCW Technical Secretariat
has recently issued a report on technical assistance
provided with regard to the Salisbury incident. At the
same time, we also note that the parties concerned have
yet to agree on mutually acceptable conclusions. Further
investigations are required to determine the nature of
the incident and the parties to be held accountable.
China believes that a comprehensive, objective and
impartial investigation should be conducted, and on
the basis of solid evidence, conclusions that can stand
the test of facts and history should be drawn. In the
current circumstances, all parties should pursue their
consultations and carry out further investigations to
uncover the truth.

The international community is facing numerous
challenges and all parties should reject the Cold
War mentality, join hands to maintain world peace,
stability and security; remain committed to a new type
of international relations based on mutual respect,
equity, justice and win-Win cooperation; and build a
community of a shared future for humankind. Council
members in particular should remain united so as to
jointly fulfil the responsibilities of maintaining world
peace and security.
