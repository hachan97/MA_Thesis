Mr. Guan Jian (China) (spoke in Chinese): At
the outset, the Chinese delegation would like to
congratulate Judge Pocar on his election to the
presidency of the International Criminal Tribunal for
the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). We are confident that,
under his leadership, the work of the ICTY will be
crowned with success. In that connection, the Chinese
delegation would like also to thank the former
President of the ICTY, Judge Meron, for his
contribution to the smooth functioning of the Tribunal.

I listened attentively to the presentations made
earlier by Judge Pocar and Prosecutor Del Ponte, and
President Mose and Prosecutor Jallow, on the work of
the ICTY and the International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda (ICTR), respectively.

China welcomes the work done by the two
Tribunals. We note in particular the fact that the two
Tribunals have taken the necessary measures to
implement the completion strategy, including measures
to expedite the trials and to refer cases involving low-
and mid-level accused to the competent national
jurisdictions. We noted also the fact that the Tribunals
will continue to contemplate new ways of enhancing
the effectiveness of their work.

China supports the efforts of the Tribunals to
implement the completion strategy. The recent transfer
of General Gotovina to the ICTY further convinced us
that, through the efforts made by various parties, the
work of the two Tribunals will meet the objectives set,
as expected by the international community.

There are three years to go before the deadline
for completion by the two Tribunals of their first-
instance trials, as envisaged in their completion
strategy. Three years is not a short period, and a great
deal can be accomplished during that time. We hope
that the Tribunals will make full use of the available
resources so as to complete their trials smoothly.
