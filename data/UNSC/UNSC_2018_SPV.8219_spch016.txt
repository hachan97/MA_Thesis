Mr. Lie Cheng (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China thanks Mr. Taye-Brook Zerihoun, Assistant
Secretary-General for Political Affairs and Acting
Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, for
his emergency-meeting briefing. We thank Kuwait
for proposing the holding of this meeting, and the
presidency of the Netherlands for quickly organizing it.

We note that the situation in Gaza is very tense,
and we are following it very closely. We are concerned
about the fact that many people have been killed or
injured. We call for implementing all the relevant
United Nations resolutions, including resolution 2334
(2016), halting all settlement activities in the occupied
territories and taking all measures to prevent violence
against civilians. All parties should remain calm and
exercise restraint, meet one another halfway and create
the necessary environment for resuming talks. Parties
with major influence on countries in the Middle East
should also play a constructive role in that regard.

The question of Palestine is the foundational
issue underlying achieving peace in the Middle East.
We call for the unity of the Security Council and the
international community and for continued efforts
to advance the political settlement of the question of
Palestine. The two-State solution is the correct way to
resolve the issue. We must adhere to the relevant United
Nations resolutions, the principle of land for peace and
the Arab Peace Initiative, based upon which we must
step up efforts to push for the resumption of talks.

China firmly supports and promotes the
peace process in the Middle East and supports the
establishment of an independent and sovereign
Palestinian State by the Palestinian people based on the
1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. China
will continue to actively promote President Xi Jinping's
four-point proposal for settling the Palestinian question
and will continue to play a constructive role in the
Middle East peace process.
