The President (spoke in French): Despite the
lateness of the hour, I propose to continue this meeting,
as it is my understanding that this would be more
convenient for our guests. I myself am obliged to
leave, and I shall soon turn the Chair over to my
colleague Mrs. Brigitte Collet.

The next speaker is the representative of Rwanda,
Mr. Martin Ngoga, Deputy Prosecutor-General of the
Republic of Rwanda. I invite him to take a seat at the
Council table and to make his statement.
