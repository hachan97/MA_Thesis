Mr. Gonzalez de Linares Palou (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): I would like to start by congratulating and
thanking the Permanent Representative of Angola,
Ambassador Gaspar Martins, and his colleagues for
their work in leading the Security Council in March.
I would also like to express to you, Ambassador Liu
Jieyi, our pleasure at seeing at the helm of the Council.
I wish you and your team every success in your
mandate, as well as a calm and peaceful presidency.
Spain would also like to thank France for its resolute
and tireless commitment to the adoption of resolution
2279 (2016), as well as the other delegations for their
always constructive contributions, made in a spirit
of flexibility.

If the Security Council was able to adopt this
resolution unanimously this afternoon it was because,
beyond the differences we have, there are some
fundamental objectives on which we all agree: the
urgency of ending the violence afflicting Burundi
for months and to return to the path of dialogue - a
dialogue that must be genuine and inclusive, based on
respect for the Constitution and the Arusha Agreement
and open to all actors committed to a peaceful resolution
of the crisis.

We hope that this resolution will contribute
significantly to national, regional and international
efforts to bring peace, stability and prosperity to the
people of Burundi, for that is simply the whole of the
aspiration of the Council. We will continue working to
that end.
