The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of the Syrian Arab Republic and
Lebanon, in which they request to be invited to
participate in the consideration of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
consideration without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Ja'afari
(Syrian Arab Republic) took a seat at the Council
table; Mr. Ramadan (Lebanon) took the seat
reserved for him at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The President: I give the floor to the
representative of the Syrian Arab Republic.
