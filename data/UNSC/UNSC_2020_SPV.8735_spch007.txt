Mr. Yao Shaojun (China) (spoke in Chinese): At the outset, I would like to thank you, Sir, for your briefing on your recent work in your capacity as the Chair of the Security Council Committee pursuant to resolution 751 (1992), concerning Somalia. I also welcome your recent visit to Somalia. Over the past few months, the Federal Government of Somalia has improved relations and enhanced communications with the Sanctions Committee and its Panel of Experts. The positive progress achieved is encouraging. Maintaining the mutual trust and cooperation between the Sanctions Committee and the Panel and the Federal Government of Somalia is very important as it bears upon the effectiveness of relevant measures of the Security Council. China encourages the Panel to continue to utilize its comparative advantages, seek greater input from Somalia and countries and organizations in the region, provide constructive assistance based on needs and respond in a timely manner on matters of interest to Somalia. The Sanctions Committee is an important tool of the Security Council to maintain regional peace and stability. It should improve the focus of its work and pay more attention to critical issues affecting regional security, help Somalia effectively combat terrorist forces, such as Al-Shabaab and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, and help the Somali Government to enhance its governance and security capabilities. Finally, China would like to reiterate that sanctions are not the end but the means, and should contribute to the political settlement of relevant issues. Sanctions should be adjusted in the light of developments in a timely fashion and eventually lifted.
