The President: I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Viet Nam. First of all, Viet Nam commends the efforts of the co-penholders, as well as the efforts and constructive engagement of other important partners, including other members of the Security Council. Viet Nam voted in favour of resolution 2504 (2020), bearing in mind that the cross-border humanitarian aid mechanism remains an essential part of the overall humanitarian response in Syria. In that regard, we would like to express our appreciation to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for its tireless efforts, and we support its continued operation in accordance with the mandate provided by the relevant Security Council resolutions. We believe that the Office will continue its work in an effective and accountable way. Viet Nam shares the concerns of other members about the ongoing complicated humanitarian situation in Syria. Viet Nam is of the position that the Syrian Government bears the primary responsibility of settling that situation, with the assistance of the international community. It is also necessary to ensure that international humanitarian aid be delivered in a timely and adequate manner to the hundreds of thousands of people in urgent need, and not be diverted or subjected to manipulation. I now resume my functions as President of the Council. I give the floor to the representative of the Syrian Arab Republic.
