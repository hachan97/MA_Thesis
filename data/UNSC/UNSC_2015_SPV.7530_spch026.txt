The President (spoke in Spanish): I have been
informed that this is the last time that the observer of
the European Union will take the floor in the Council,
and I believe I am conveying the sentiments not only
of the members of the Council but of all the members
of the United Nations represented here today, which
reflect our sadness at the departure of an Ambassador
who has done his job admirably first as Ambassador of
Austria and since then of the European Union. He has
consistently displayed skill and ability. I know he has
earned the full respect of every member of the United
Nations. He is a man of much experience whom we will
miss. On behalf ofus all, I would like to wish him every
happiness in his future professional and personal life.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Colombia.
