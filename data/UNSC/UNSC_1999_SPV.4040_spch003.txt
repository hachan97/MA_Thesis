The President: May I take it that the draft report, as
corrected, is adopted by the Council?

There being no objection, it is so decided.
This decision will be reflected in a note by the
President of the Security Council, to be issued as

document S/1999/933.

The Security Council has thus concluded its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 1.30 p.m.
