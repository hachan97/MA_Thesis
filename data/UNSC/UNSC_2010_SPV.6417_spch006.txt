Mr. Duale (Somalia): Thank you, Mr. President,
for allowing me to participate in this meeting and to
say a few words. I also thank Security Council
members who are still very much seized with the issues
that we are discussing today - piracy and the
restoration of law and order in Somalia. We hope that
stabilization and the restoration of law and order in
Somalia, my country, will largely resolve the problem
that the international community and Somalia alike
face with regard to pirates. Pirates are now present not
only in the Gulf ofAden, but also in the Indian Ocean.

Let me first of all thank Under-Secretary-General
Pascoe for briefing us on the report (S/2010/556) of the
Secretary-General. We support the report because it
conveys the real problems faced by the international
community in combating piracy off the coast of
Somalia, as well as those suffered by neighbouring and
far-off countries alike. The Secretary-General has also
pinpointed a number of issues that, if taken care of,
would in large measure solve the problems we face
within and outside of the country.

Let me also thank Mr. Fedotov, of the United
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, for the support
that his Office has so far provided with respect to legal
aspects of the possibilities for the detention and
prosecution of pirates in neighbouring countries. We
also thank neighbouring countries that, in spite of the
great burden posed to them, have offered support and
agreed to detain and prosecute pirates.

I also wish to convey my country's regret that
there are still a good number of seafarers who remain
in captivity in pirates' dens and ports. We extend our
sympathy to the families and the countries of origin of
these seafarers. The Transitional Federal Government
regrets that this has happened. We hope that it will
cease to happen - the sooner the better.
