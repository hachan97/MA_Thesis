The President: On behalf of the Council, I
should like to express gratitude and appreciation to all
of the members of the Security Council mission, which
was very ably led by Ambassador Terzi, for the manner
in which they discharged their important responsibility
on behalf of the Council.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my list.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.
