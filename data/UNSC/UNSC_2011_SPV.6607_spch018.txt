Mr. Osorio (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): First
of all, I should like to thank all the members of the
Security Council for their words of support to the work
just concluded by the Committee established pursuant
to resolution 1737 (2006). Their words will be
conveyed in particular to the members of the Panel of
Experts who have worked with me and demonstrated
not only a great spirit of cooperation, but also the
ability to compromise in the search for the best ways to
run the Committee, which shoulders a great
responsibility, as evidenced by all the statements made
here today.

I have taken due note of the calls to ensure that
the activities of the Panel be as transparent, objective
and clear as possible and that, as a result, we can fulfil
our obligation and commitment to conveying the
results of the follow-up to all United Nations Members
and the legal responsibilities of the members of the
Panel and of the Committee.

We shall continue our work and, pursuant to
resolution 1373 (2001), to update the members of the
Security Council.
