The President (spoke in Russian): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Angola in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Gaspar
Martins (Angola) took a seat at the Council table.

The President (spoke in Russian): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Ibrahim Gambari, Under-Secretary-
General and Special Adviser of the Secretary-General
for Special Assignments in Africa.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Gambari to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Under-Secretary-General and Special
Adviser for Special Assignments in Africa, Mr.
Ibrahim Gambari.
