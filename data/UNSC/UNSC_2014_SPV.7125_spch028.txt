Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Perhaps I should not comment on such
trivial things, but the statement made by my colleague
Ms. Power made it sound as if we oppose something that
we do not oppose. We are not excluding the role of some
international bodies, but I explained why that approach
might not be enough.

More importantly, I would like to ask my French
colleague not to engage in hyperbole. We do not need
hyperbole. Furthermore, I did not say that the majority
of those who protested in the streets of Kyiv were radical
nationalists. I did not say that. The minority of them may
have been, but the problem is that they were the ones
who not nly called the tune but also played along with the
band. They have now taken over Government authority
in Kyiv and are sending people to east and southern
Ukraine and to the territory of Crimea.
