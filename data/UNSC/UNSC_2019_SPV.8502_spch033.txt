Mr. Lacroix (spoke in French): I shall briefly
address several points, but first I should like to thank all
speakers for their words of praise for the United Nations
Mission for Justice Support in Haiti (MINUJUSTH),
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for
Haiti and all our colleagues working in Haiti.

Secondly, I also thank all representatives who
expressed their intention to maintain their bilateral
support for consolidating stability in Haiti. Whatever
the Security Council may decide with respect to the
nature of the future United Nations presence in Haiti,
it is clear that maintaining and even strengthening such
bilateral support Will be of particular importance.

Thirdly, I should like to respond to the question
concerning the investigations into the incidents that
took place in La Saline. Obviously, as Minister Edmond
noted, it is up to the competent Haitian authorities to
pursue and complete the investigations under way.
With regard to the investigation launched by the United
Nations, it is advancing and we expect to share its
results with the Security Council in the next report
of the Secretary-General, whose date of issuance
will be determined by the Security Council in its
next resolution.

Lastly, I should like to refer to the participation
of women, in particular in the context of the coming
elections. I encourage the Haitian authorities to enshrine
in the future electoral law the constitutional provisions
on the participation of women and to encourage their
full participation in the next local and legislative
consultations. Naturally, the full support of the United
Nations and the partners will be very important in
that regard.
