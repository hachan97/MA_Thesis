The President: The Security Council will now

begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

After consultations among Council members, I

have been authorized to make the following statement
on their behalf:

"The Security Council recalls its resolutions
2042 (2012), 2043 (2012), 2118 (2013), 2139 (2014),
2165 (2014), 2170 (2014), 2175 (2014), 2178 (2014),
2191 (2014), 2199 (2015), and 2235 (2015) and
presidential statements 0f3 August 2011, 2 October
2013 and 24 April 2015.

"The Security Council reaffirms its strong
commitment to the sovereignty, independence,
unity and territorial integrity of Syria and all
other States affected by the Syrian conflict, and to
the purposes and principles of the Charter of the
United Nations.

"The Security Council stresses that the only
sustainable solution to the current crisis in Syria
is through an inclusive and Syrian-led political
process that meets the legitimate aspirations of the
Syrian people, with a view to full implementation
of the Geneva communique of 30 June 2012 and, in
this regard, emphasizes the urgency for all parties
to work diligently and constructively towards this
goal.

"The Security Council reiterates its demands
as set forth in resolution 2139 (2014) that all parties
cease any attacks against civilians as such, as well
as any indiscriminate use of weapons in populated
areas, including such use involving shelling
and barrel bombs; as well as its demand for the
immediate end to arbitrary detention, torture,
kidnappings, abductions and forced disappearances
of civilians and the immediate release of those
arbitrarily detained, including journalists and
humanitarian personnel; stresses the importance of
implementation of such demands, in accordance with
relevant provisions of international law, in creating
an environment conducive to the commencement
of substantive political negotiations and in building

confidence among the parties; and reiterates, in this
regard, that the primary responsibility to protect its
population lies with the Syrian authorities.

"The Security Council expresses its gravest
concern that parts of Syria are under control of
terrorist groups such as the Islamic State in Iraq and
the Levant (ISIL) and the Al-Nusra Front (ANF),
condemns the ongoing and multiple terrorist
acts by ISIL, ANF and all other individuals,
groups, undertakings and entities associated with
Al-Qaida, condemns further the targeting of
civilians based on their ethnicity, religion and/or
confessional affiliations, expresses concern about
the negative impact of terrorism, Violent extremist
ideology in support of terrorism, and action that
destabilizes Syria and the region, with a devastating
humanitarian impact on the civilian population,
reaffirms its resolve to address all aspects of the
threat; and calls on all parties to commit to putting
an end to terrorist acts perpetrated by ISIL, ANF
and all other individuals, groups, undertakings and
entities associated with Al-Qaida.

"The Security Council commends the Special
Envoy for his efforts in convening the Geneva
consultations, from April to June 2015, with a broad
range of stakeholders with respect to the crisis in
Syria as part ofthe effort to operationalize the 2012
Geneva communique.

"The Security Council supports the approach
set out by the Special Envoy that in order to work
towards political negotiations and a political
transition based on the Geneva communique, four
thematic areas need to be addressed through more
focused consultations and discussions with the
Syrian parties in four thematic working groups:
safety and protection for all; political and legal
issues; military, security and counterterrorism
issues; and continuity of public services and
reconstruction and development.

"The Security Council urges all parties to
engage in good faith in the efforts of the Special
Envoy, through his good offices, and to continue
consultations and thematic discussions, and notes
that these efforts can build on recent initiatives,

including the meetings in Moscow, Cairo, Paris and
Astana.

"The Security Council demands that all
parties work urgently towards the comprehensive
implementation of the Geneva communique,
aimed at bringing an end to all violence, violations
and abuses of human rights and violations of
international humanitarian law and the launching
of a Syrian-led political process leading to a
political transition that meets the legitimate
aspirations of the Syrian people and enables them
independently and democratically to determine
their future, including through the establishment of
an inclusive transitional governing body with full
executive powers, which shall be formed on the
basis of mutual consent while ensuring continuity
of governmental institutions.

"The Security Council welcomes the Secretary-
General's statement of 29 July 2015 that there can
be no military solution to the Syrian conflict,
and reiterates its endorsement of a political
solution through implementation of the Geneva
communique.

"The Security Council stresses that rapid
progress on a political solution should include
full participation by all segments of Syrian
society, including women, and represents the only
sustainable way to resolve the situation in Syria
peacefully.

"The Security Council emphasizes the need
for robust international and regional assistance in
support of the Special Envoy's efforts.

"The Security Council expresses grave alarm
that the Syrian crisis has become the largest
humanitarian emergency crisis in the world today,
threatening peace and security in the region, and that
at least 250,000 people have been killed, including
well over 10,000 children; 12 million people have
been forced to flee their homes, including over
4 million who have sought refuge in neighbouring
countries; and more than 12.2 million people in
Syria require urgent humanitarian assistance. In
this regard, the Security Council recalls its decision
as set forth in resolution 2165 (2014) that all Syrian
parties to the conflict shall enable the immediate
and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance
directly to people throughout Syria.

"The Security Council recalls the need for
all parties to respect the relevant provisions of
international humanitarian law and the United
Nations guiding principles of humanitarian
emergency assistance.

"The Security Council requests that the
Secretary-General report back to the Security
Council on the results of the next phase of
consultations within 90 days."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2015/15.

I shall now give the floor to the members of the
Security Council who wish to make statements.
