The President: Thank you very much,
Mr. Madavo, for coming. It was at fairly short notice
that you were prepared to come. In a few weeks' time
my country will no longer be sitting at this table. This
has been a little bit of a precedent, and I hope that
others in the future will also think "why not ask these
people to jump on a shuttle and come and join us in the
debate whenever we think it is relevant?" I am sure that
you and your colleagues would be prepared to do so. I
hope that this is a first, but not a last. I think it did
contribute to the quality of our debates to have you
here. Thank you very much for coming.

Finally, I give the floor to you, Mr. Vice-Prime
Minister.
