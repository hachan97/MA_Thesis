Major General Mood: We, the force
commanders, have discussed our concerns related to
the increasing capability gap, the caveats and the
challenges of achieving integrated effects, to mention
only a few. We also fully recognize that it is our
responsibility to keep the situational awareness of the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the Secretary-
General and the Security Council up to date through
timely and accurate reporting.

To respond the specific question from the
representative of Lebanon on the reporting of the
United Nations Truce Supervision Organization
(UNTSO), the answer is that UNTSO reports directly
to the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping
Operations on our dialogue and activities. Our
observers in southern Lebanon contribute to the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) reporting
in accordance with an operational control relationship,
which simply means that, on a day-to-day basis, they
report to the UNIFIL Force Commander, in a way that
is similar to how those on the Golan interact with the
United Nations Disengagement Observer Force. I am
confident that these arrangements ensure impartial,
factual reporting for the benefit of the awareness of
Headquarters related both to the regional perspective
and to incidents and violations of Security Council
resolutions.
