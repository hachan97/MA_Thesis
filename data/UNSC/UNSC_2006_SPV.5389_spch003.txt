The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of Liberia. I
think the Council's applause attests to the support of
the United Nations, not only in the past, but also for
the future of democracy in Liberia.

I shall now call on Council members who would
like to address President J ohnson-Sirleaf.
