Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): I wish to
thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman and Mr. Hug
for their briefings. In February, the leaders of Russia,
France, Germany and Ukraine reached an important
consensus in Minsk on the political settlement of the
Ukrainian crisis. The Security Council unanimously
adopted resolution 2202 (2015), endorsing the package
of measures for the implementation of the Minsk
agreements by the parties concerned, which reflected
support for a political settlement of the Ukrainian
crisis. After the Council's adoption of the resolution,
progress was made in such areas as the ceasefire, the
withdrawal of heavy weapons and the establishment of
working groups, as outlined in the Minsk package of
measures.

For some time, the overall situation in eastern
Ukraine remained stable and a ceasefire was generally
observed. Recently, the situation in eastern Ukraine
has again deteriorated. China calls on the parties
concerned to keep calm, exercise restraint, consolidate
the hard-won ceasefire and press ahead with a political
settlement of the Ukrainian crisis in order to achieve
peace and tranquillity in Ukraine at an early date. The
international community should make joint efforts in
that direction. The Council's discussion should also
play a constructive role in that regard.

China has always respected the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of all countries, including Ukraine,
and it believes that dialogue and consultations are the
only solution to the Ukrainian issue. China calls on
the parties concerned to make joint efforts to find a
comprehensive, balanced and lasting political solution
as soon as possible so as to achieve peace, tranquillity,
stability and development in Ukraine and the region as
a whole. China will continue to play a constructive role
in promoting a political settlement of the Ukrainian
issue.
