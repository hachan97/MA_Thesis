The President (spoke in French): In accordance
with the understanding reached among Council
members, I wish to remind all speakers to limit their
statements to no more than four minutes, in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to circulate the text in writing and to deliver
a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.

I now give the floor to the representative of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo. On behalf of the
Security Council, I extend a warm welcome to Marie-
Madeleine Kalala, Minister for Human Rights.
