S/1997/458, letters dated 9 and 11 June 1997, respectively,
from the Executive Chairman of the Special Commission

addressed to the President of the Security Council;
S/ 1997/456, letter dated 13 June 1997 from the Permanent
Representative of Iraq addressed to the President of the

to paragraph 9 (b) (i) of Security Council resolution 687
(1991); and S/ 1997/457, letter dated 13 June 1997 from the

Executive Chairman of the Special Commission established
by the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 9 (b) (i) of
Security Council resolution 687 (1991).

Following consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council takes note of the letters
from the Executive Chairman of the Special
Commission dated 9 and 11 June 1997 (S/1997/455 and S/ 1997/458), the letter from the Deputy Prime
Minister of Iraq dated 5 June 1997 (S/ 1997/456) and
the letter from the Under-Secretary of the Ministry
for Foreign Affairs of Iraq dated 6 June 1997
(S/l 997/457). The Council expresses serious concern
at the four incidents on 4, 5 and 7 June 1997 in
which Iraqi personnel unacceptably interfered with
helicopter flights operating in support of inspection
of sites designated by the Special Commission under
Security Council resolutions 687 (1991), 707 (1991)
and 715 (1991), endangering the helicopters and
their crews, as well as persons on the ground.

"The Security Council deplores these incidents
and underlines that Iraq must immediately take
effective steps to put an end to all such actions. The
Council reminds Iraq of its obligations under the
relevant resolutions of the Council, in particular
resolution 1060 (1996). The Council affirms that
Iraq is obliged to ensure the security of the
personnel of the Special Commission and to permit
the Commission to carry out its air operations
anywhere in Iraq without interference of any kind in
accordance with pertinent provisions of resolution
707 (1991). The Council recalls the commitments
contained in the joint statement of the Special
Commission and Iraq of 22 June 1996.

"The Security Council reiterates its continuing
support to the Special Commission in its efforts to
ensure the implementation of its mandate under the
relevant resolutions of the Council".

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/1997/33.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 4.35 pm.
