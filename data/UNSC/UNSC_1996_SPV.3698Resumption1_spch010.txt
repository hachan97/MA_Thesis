The President (interpretation from French): I thank
the Foreign Minister of Algeria for his kind words
addressed to me.

The next speaker is the First Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the State of Kuwait,
His Excellency Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-
Sabah. I welcome him and invite him to take a seat at the
Council table and to make his statement.
