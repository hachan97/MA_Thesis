Mr. Adi (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic):
In the statement I made earlier, I did not focus on
certain technical aspects of some the Council's counter-
terrorism Sanctions Committees. Unfortunately, the
representative of Israel raised the issue of terrorism
in Syria in an attempt to cover up his country's
involvement in the crisis in my country and Israel's
support for terrorists operating there.

As Council members and the Israeli representative
know very well, we have much to stay about Israeli
terrorism, but at this meeting I shall refrain from
retelling the story of Israeli violations in order to keep
the door open to action in response to our repeated
requests for cooperation in the fight against the
terrorism in my country.
