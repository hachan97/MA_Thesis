The President: Council members express their
deepest condolences to the family of Maitre Alioune
Blondin Beye, the Secretary-General's Special
Representative for Angola, and to the families of the
colleagues and crew who were accompanying him: Mr.
Koffi Adjoyi, Mr. Beadengar Dessande, Mr. Moctar

 

Gueye, Mr. Ibikunle Williams, Captain Alvaro Costa, Mr.
Jason Hunter and Mr. Andrew McCurrach.
The members of the Council also express very deep
condolences to the Governments concerned, namely, the
Governments of Mali, Togo, Chad, Senegal, Nigeria,
Portugal and South Africa.

Over the past several years, the Council has relied on
the wise counsel of Maitre Beye in guiding the peace
process in Angola. Maitre Beye dedicated himself
wholeheartedly to the cause of peace and maintained his
optimism even under the most adverse circumstances. The
Council expresses its hope that the efforts of this eminent
son of Africa will not have been in vain and that his vision
of a peaceful and prosperous Angola will soon triumph.

I request members to stand and observe a minute of
silence in memory of those who so tragically lost their lives
on 26 June 1998.

The members of the Council observed a minute of
silence.

The President: I give the floor to the representative
of Angola.
