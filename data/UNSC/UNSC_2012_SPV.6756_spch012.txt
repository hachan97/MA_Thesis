Mr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish):
Exactly one week ago, Guatemala voted to adopt
resolution 2042 (2012). In spite of the fact that not all
the conditions laid down in that resolution have been
met before the next step is taken, today we again voted
to adopt the new resolution, 2043 (2012). We did so on
the recommendation of the Secretary-General and of
Joint Special Envoy Kofi Annan, and in order to be
consistent with the position we have taken on the
events in Syria since their beginning.

While we share the scepticism expressed by
various members of the Council regarding the
commitment of the Government of Syria to complying
with all six points in the Special Envoy's proposal -
points that the Government has committed to - we
believe that the best course of action is to give the
Government and the members of the opposition the
benefit of the doubt, and to trust that the presence of
United Nations observers on the ground will make a
genuine difference to the capacity of the United Nations
and the League of Arab States to help find a way out of
this crisis.

We should remember that while the task at hand is
to put an immediate end to the violence, a lasting
solution requires negotiations among every sector of
Syrian society to reach a peaceful agreement
characterized by inclusive democratization and a
respect for human rights. That is a noble objective, and
we believe that it is worth taking this chance to see it
fulfilled - perhaps the last chance of avoiding far
worse evils.
