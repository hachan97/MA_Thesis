Mr. Natalegawa (Indonesia): We are deeply
concerned by the latest situation in Georgia. The
potential for further escalation of violence is real.
Almost invariably, such a spiral of violence has serious
humanitarian implications for those who are
vulnerable. Therefore, much is at stake. My delegation
deems it important that a cessation of hostilities be
established, and that the parties exercise maximum
restraint, including from making inflammatory
statements. While recognizing the obvious challenge, it
is important that open lines of communication be
established between the sides at the highest level and
that confidence be established and nurtured.
In the final analysis, there is no substitute for
dialogue. That open line of communication must be

coupled with tangible efforts on both sides to end the
bloodshed.

At this crucial hour, it is pertinent for the Council
to act collectively and in unison in expressing concern
and in calling on all sides to exercise maximum
restraint, to de-escalate the conflict and violence and to
embark on emergency talks in a timely manner. My
delegation attaches great importance to the Council's
role in managing rapidly evolving crises. We therefore
very much regret the fact that, despite obvious
common concerns, the Council has yet to express its
collective view on this very important issue.
