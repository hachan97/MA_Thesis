The President (spoke in Arabic): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Kieran Prendergast, Under-Secretary-
General for Political Affairs.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Security Council have before
them the report of the Secretary-General on the Sudan

resolution 1556 (2004), paragraph 15 of Security Council
resolution 1564 (2004) and paragraph 17 of Security
Council resolution 1574 (2004) (S/2004/947).

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Kieran Prendergast, Under-Secretary-
General for Political Affairs. I now give him the floor.
