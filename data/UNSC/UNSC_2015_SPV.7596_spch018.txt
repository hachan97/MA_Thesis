Mr. Gimolieca (Angola): We would like to thank
Mr. Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, the Special Envoy of
the Secretary-General for Yemen; Mr. Zeid Ra'ad Al
Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights; and Ms. Kyung-wha Kang, the Assistant
Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs.

We also take this opportunity to commend
Mr. Ahmed for being able to broker the ceasefire
agreement last week, which surely brought a welcome
break in the fighting for the people of Yemen. After
more than a year of fighting, the loss of thousands of
lives and the worsening humanitarian situation, the
warring sides have to seize such opportunities in order
to reduce the suffering of the people of Yemen and to
achieve a sustainable political settlement.

It is most unfortunate that the proposed ceasefire
was repeatedly violated during the peace talks in
Switzerland, and that no tangible outcome was
achieved. However, we are fully aware that this
process will take time and patience. We therefore
welcome the announcement by Special Envoy Ahmed
that a new round of talks will be held on 14 January.
In the meantime, we reiterate our call on the warring
parties to respect the safety of the civilian population
and to heed the call for a permanent ceasefire in order
to prevent further loss of life and the proliferation of
terrorist armed groups, including the Islamic State in
Iraq and the Sham, that have exploited the violence to
spread their influence in that volatile region.
