Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian):
Given the urgent need to scale up the peacekeeping
presence in the Central African Republic, we supported
the adoption of resolution 2134 (2014), which, inter alia,
approves the deployment of a European Union operation
in support of the African Union (AU) International
Support Mission. We hope that the European mission
will be effective in strengthening the international
community's contribution to stabilizing the political
and social situation and protecting civilians in the
country.

Given the leading role of the AU peacekeeping
contingent, which has already received the approval
of the Security Council, we think it would have been
suitable and logical for Brussels to have entered into a
formal agreement with the AU before the adoption of
resolution 2134 (2014). Unfortunately, that did not take
place. Indeed, in the preparation of such decisions, the
Security Council has to have all the relevant information
on the parameters ofthe future cooperation and division
of labour between the peacekeeping operations and the
Central African Republic.

The resolution of those issues will have a great
impact on the effectiveness of the AU's activities
and the normalization of the situation in the country.
Accordingly, we hope that Brussels will conclude all
the necessary agreements and procedures and draw up
the practical aspects of cooperation with the AU before
the deployment of its own operations.
