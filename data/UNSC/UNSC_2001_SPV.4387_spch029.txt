The President: I thank Mr. Haekkerup for the
further valuable clarifications he has provided and for
his presence with us today.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Council will remain seized of the matter.

The meeting rose at 1.05 pm.
