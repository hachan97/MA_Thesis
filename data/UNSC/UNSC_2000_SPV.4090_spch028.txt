The President: I will make only one observation in
closing, and that is that very strong unanimity has been
expressed here today in support of the sanctions. We look
forward to Ambassador Fowler's more specific report in
the near future. My Government will do everything that
it can, and more than it has done in the past, to assist that
process when we hear more details from Ambassador
Fowler. I urge him to report to us as soon as he can, in
the next month or so.

I hope that the world is listening very carefully. I
hope that the people in the jungles of Angola, who have
continued this war unnecessarily for so long, will hear
this message - dim though it may be by the time it gets
there - and understand that the war benefits nobody and
damages the great potential of the people of Angola.

In the interests of time, I will distribute my own
remarks at a later date.

The meeting rose at 1.10 pm.
