Mr. Mayoral (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish):
First of all, allow me to welcome Ambassador John
Bolton. I assure him of my and my delegation's
determination to work with him and his Mission, as we
have done since we became members of the Security
Council.

My delegation voted in favour of the resolution
submitted by the United Kingdom and the United
States because Argentina most vigorously and
unequivocally condemns and has condemned all acts of
terrorist violence in Iraq, which have killed many
innocent civilians, including children. In that regard, I
wish once again to extend the condolences of the
people and Government of Argentina to all the family
members of the Victims of those brutal attacks.

We also reaffirm our condemnation of the attacks
on the diplomatic community accredited in Iraq and
again convey our condolences to the Governments of
Algeria and Egypt, which recently suffered the
assassinations of their diplomats in Baghdad.

We also reiterate that there is absolutely no
justification for terrorist acts and that those who are
responsible for and perpetrate such acts should be
brought to justice. The international community is
duty-bound to cooperate with such efforts, pursuant to
the resolutions of the Security Council and other
relevant international obligations.

We also believe it essential that the Iraqi political
process, if it is to be successful, be as inclusive as
possible and that all Iraqi sectors involved - political,
ethnic and religious - join in a genuine dialogue that
would help to achieve national reconciliation in that
country.

Lastly, we wish further to note that, as we
struggle against terrorism, we cannot lose sight of the
need to respect civilians. In that regard, my country
appeals to all the forces acting to maintain security in
Iraq to take all the necessary precautions to protect the
civilian population at all times in the context of respect
for human rights and international humanitarian law.
