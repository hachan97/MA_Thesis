Mr. Khalilzad (United States of America): I take
the floor to highlight one issue. I think almost everyone
who has spoken this afternoon has highlighted the
importance of ceasing the fighting - of a ceasefire. I
note that the representative of Georgia has said that
Georgia is ready to accept a ceasefire, but my Russian
colleague's statement was silent on the issue of the
need for an immediate end to the violence and for
accepting a ceasefire. I believe that it is very important
that the message go out, loud and clear from here, that
there has to be a ceasefire. We understand that there are
issues separating the parties, and we want those issues
to be addressed. But what is needed is an end to the
violence.

Therefore, there has to be a cessation of violence,
and we urge the Russian Federation to join what
appears to be a consensus for a cessation of violence -
for a ceasefire. I believe that this is something that we
can all come together on. It would send the right
message to the people of Georgia and would put us on
the path to dealing with the issues, which several
colleagues - almost everyone, including our Russian
colleague - have raised and that need to be addressed.
