Mr. Thiebaud (France) (interpretation from French): My delegation, which presented the draft text,
together with all the members of the Contact Group and
the Czech Republic, is gratified at its prompt and
unanimous adoption by the Council at a decisive point in
the peace process in the former Yugoslavia.

While this new resolution is technical in nature, the
improvements made to it - the extension of the
suspension period to 180 days - also reflects the
conviction of France and of all the members of the
Council that a real dynamics of negotiation seems today
to have begun and must be encouraged in order to

 

achieve as soon as possible a just and lasting peace in the
entire region.

It is thus our hope that the Council will have the
opportunity to decide, on the basis of how the situation
evolves, on further alleviation of sanctions. This would
reflect the peace efforts of the international community, in
which, as the Council knows, France has fully participated
and will continue fully to participate.
