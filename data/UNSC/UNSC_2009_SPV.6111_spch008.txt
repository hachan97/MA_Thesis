Mr. Poukre-Kono (Central African Republic) (spoke in French): Let me begin by thanking
Mr. Edmond Mulet for his briefing and for his
introduction of the report of the Secretary-General
(S/2009/199), which describes developments in the
region, both in Chad and in the Central African
Republic. My gratitude goes to the troops of the
European Union-led military force (EUFOR) in Chad
and the Central African Republic for their contribution
to easing the tension in the subregion between certain
rebel groups and the civilian population.

I wish to thank Mr. Mulet also for having sent a
very strong signal to the Security Council: that the lack
of military equipment now be taken seriously and that
a solution be found quickly. In my view, if we
genuinely wish to see stability in the political and
security spheres, it is only proper that the Security
Council should consider the matter, and should in
particular take into account the human aspect, with
civilians caught between rebel forces and loyalist
forces defending the territory.

I believe that today's briefing and the report of
the Secretary-General call on us all to find a concrete
solution.
