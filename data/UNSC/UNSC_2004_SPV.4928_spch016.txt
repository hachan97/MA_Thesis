Mr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): I wish to
express my gratitude for the presence in our midst of
the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Germany and of
Serbia and Montenegro, as well as that of the
Secretary-General.

My delegation fully endorses the statement to be
made later by the European Union presidency.
We vigorously condemn the clashes that have
taken place in Kosovo, which have resulted in many
deaths and injuries as well as in attacks against
international organizations in Kosovo. We appeal to all
Kosovo communities to put an end to the acts of
violence and to return to dialogue and negotiation in
order to resolve their differences.

Lastly, we reaffirm our conviction that resolution
1244 (1999) is the sole legal framework for the
establishment of a democratic and multi-ethnic society
in Kosovo.
