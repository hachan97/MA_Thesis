Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
At the outset, Sir, I would like to join previous
speakers in congratulating you on your assumption of
the presidency of the Security Council for this month.
My delegation will fully support you in your work. At
the same time, I also wish to thank the Permanent
Representative of Spain for his outstanding leadership
of the Council last month. September is the busiest
month at the United Nations, but under his able
guidance, the Council duly completed its work.

A few days ago, the Israeli military launched a
large-scale military operation in the Gaza Strip, which
has caused heavy casualties among Palestinian
civilians, including women and children. This
constitutes a further escalation of the bloodletting and
conflict between Israel and Palestine - a matter of
serious concern to China. It has seriously exacerbated
the already grave situation in the Middle East. We
strongly urge Israel to immediately halt its military
operations against Palestine and to keep the situation
from further deteriorating and veering out of control.

We also call for a halt to attacks against Israeli
civilians. China has stressed repeatedly that peace in
the Middle East can be achieved only through
negotiations, not through the use of violence and force.
We urge the parties concerned to resume contact and
dialogue as soon as possible, and to return to the
correct path of political negotiations.

As the principal organ entrusted with the
maintenance of international peace and security, the
Security Council cannot remain indifferent and act as a
mere spectator to the present situation. The Council
should immediately take measures to fulfil its
responsibility of protecting civilians.

China supports the draft resolution submitted by
the Arab Group and hopes it can be adopted as soon as
possible.
