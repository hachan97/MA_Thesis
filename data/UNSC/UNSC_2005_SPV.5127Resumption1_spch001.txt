The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Mali in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Diarra
(Mali) took the seat reserved for him at the side
ofthe Council Chamber

The President (spoke in French): I wish to
remind all speakers of what I indicated at this
morning's meeting, that is, that they should limit their
statements to no more than five minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to circulate the texts in writing and to deliver
a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.

Also, I will not individually invite speakers to
take seats at the table or invite them to resume their
seats at the side of the Chamber. When a speaker is
taking the floor, the Conference Officer will seat the
next speaker on the list at the table.

I thank representatives for their understanding
and cooperation.

The next speaker on my list is the representative
of Australia, to whom I give the floor.
