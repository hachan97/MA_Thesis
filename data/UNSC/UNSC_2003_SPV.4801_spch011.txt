Mr. Pleuger (Germany): I have the feeling that
everything has already been said, but not yet by
everybody.

I would like to join other delegations in
commending the work done by the Secretary-General
and his Personal Envoy, Mr. James Baker, in preparing
this resolution. We welcome the fact that the Security
Council has reached consensus on the resolution. We
feel that it is now a fair basis for negotiations in good
faith. We call upon the parties, neighbouring States and
the Secretary-General - acting through his Personal
Envoy - to work together to use this opportunity to
come closer to a fair and negotiated settlement of this
long-standing conflict.
