Mr. Cardi (Italy): First of all, I would like to
thank Mr. Mladenov for his briefing. I also welcome
the continued personal engagement of the Secretary-
General on this issue.

Following the recent declaration on Jerusalem
by the President of the United States, Italy joined
seven other members of the Security Council in
requesting this meeting. Italy's position on Jerusalem
remains unchanged. It continues to be consistent
with that expressed by the European Union and with
international consensus based on the relevant United
Nations resolutions.

We believe that the status of Jerusalem as the future
capital of two States needs to be negotiated between
Israel and Palestine, within the framework of a peace
process that will eventually lead to the establishment
of two States, living side by side in peace and security,
taking into account the legitimate concerns and
aspirations of both parties. Until that moment, Italy
will continue to abide by the relevant United Nations
resolutions and will maintain its Embassy to Israel in
Tel Aviv.

We are, of course, very concerned by the risk of
unrest and tensions in the region. We call on all actors
in Palestine and the Middle East to show responsibility,
exercise restraint and refrain from any form of violence
or incitement. As the Secretary-General affirmed in
his statement on Wednesday, there is no alternative to
the two-State solution. Therefore, Italy reiterates its
commitment to working towards that aim together with
the members of the European Union and other regional
and international partners, and to contributing to the
resumption of a meaningful peace process.
