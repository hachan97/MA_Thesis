Mr. Tiirk: There were no specific questions that I
need to answer at this point, but I would like to say
how much we in the Secretariat appreciate the positive
comments that were heard in this discussion. We shall
not fail to convey to Mr. Noel Sinclair the words of
appreciation which Security Council members and
others have expressed. We are gratified that the
Security Council appreciates the sensitivity of the
current situation with regard to strengthening peace in
Bougainville.

We are equally encouraged by the support that we
have heard, for the proposal of the Secretary-General
regarding the follow-up to the United Nations Political
Office in Bougainville (UNPOB), and I would like to
again stress that this will be a very small mission and
one which will continue to be an example of the
effectiveness of United Nations work.

We have heard various comments made in that
regard, including the comment by the Ambassador of
New Zealand, who emphasized that the ongoing United
Nations political presence should be structured to
ensure that the voices of all Bougainvilleans are heard.
That is indeed a very important principle.

Finally, we are strongly encouraged by the
understanding expressed in the discussion, for the need
to pursue the finalization of three principle objectives
in Bougainville - autonomy and elections, weapons
destruction, and development and commitments which
were made to the development of Bougainville and to
the assistance necessary in the future. All of that bodes
well for the future of United Nations work in that area
and we hope that work will be successful.
