The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as the representative of Poland.

At the outset, I would like to thank Ms. Bintou
Keita, Assistant Secretary-General for Africa, for her
briefing on today's tragic events in Benghazi. First
of all, let me express my sincere condolences on the
deaths of three staff members of the United Nations
Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL). In this moment
of mourning, our thoughts and prayers are with the
families and friends of the victims and all UNSMIL
personnel on the ground.

Poland condemns in the strongest terms today's
attack on the UNSMIL vehicle carried out in Benghazi,
which resulted in the deaths of three staff members
and the injury of at least eight other people. Those
responsible for this cowardly act of violence must be
held accountable and brought to justice.

We very much regret that this heinous terrorist
attack took place one day before Eid Al-Adha, at the
beginning of the UNSMIL-facilitated truce. It clearly
shows that the full and comprehensive cessation of
hostilities is of the utmost importance. It also reminds
us that United Nations personnel very often pay the
ultimate price for their dedication to saving humankind
from hell, as Dag Hammarskjold once said.

Therefore, I would like to reiterate Poland's
full support for all efforts undertaken by Special
Representative of the Secretary-General Salame' and
UNSMIL in very challenging circumstances aimed at
bringing security, stability and national unity to Libya.
We fully support the press statement proposed by the
United Kingdom.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Libya.
