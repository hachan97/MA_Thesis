Mr. Sadykov (Kazakhstan): Our delegation voted
in favour of draft resolution S/2017/1060, which was
introduced by Egypt. Kazakhstan's position on the
Middle East peace process remains unchanged. My
country urges the parties to maintain the historical status
quo of Jerusalem in accordance with previously reached
international agreements. We support negotiations
aimed at achieving the two-State solution and stand for
their early resumption, especially in a bilateral format
and without preconditions. The ultimate goal should
be the restoration and promotion of the peace process
pursuant to the relevant Security Council resolutions,
the Madrid principles, the principle of land for peace,
the road map for peace and the Arab Peace Initiative.

It is also necessary to identify mutually acceptable
principles to advance the peace process, as well as
to develop a concept for future negotiations and the
implementing mechanism. We therefore urge the
leaders of Israel and Palestine to take concrete steps
in their areas that will strengthen prospects for peace
based on the inalienable right of the Palestinians to
statehood and right of Israel to its own durable, long-
term security.
