Mr. Moungara Moussotsi (Gabon) (spoke in French): I wish you every success in your presidency,
Madam, and assure you of the support of my
delegation. I also thank the delegation of Mexico for its
successful presidency in June.

I shall be extremely brief. Allow me first to echo
previous speakers in welcoming His Excellency
Mr. Boris Tadie, President of the Republic of Serbia,
and in thanking him for his statement. I also thank
Mr. De Kermabon and Mr. Zannier for their comments.

Like the rest of the world, my delegation learned
of the unfortunate events in northern Kosovo on Friday
that led to one death and numerous injuries. My
delegation firmly condemns such violence and extends
its condolences to the families of the deceased
pediatrician. We are gratified that all have condemned
these events and that the necessary inquiries are under
way.
The incident of Friday, 2 July, arose from the
prevailing situation in Kosovo, in particular the tension
among communities emerging, inter alia, from the
issue of Kosovo's status. My delegation reiterates in
that regard its well-known position by reaffirming its
support for the international process aimed at securing
the national sovereignty of the territory. We seek a
settlement based on resolution 1244 (1999) and support
the mandate of the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo. Gabon also
strongly favours dialogue and cooperation, which are
essential to resolving the situation in Kosovo. We also
feel that the Secretary-General's six-point plan is an
important contribution to the search for a negotiated
solution to the problem of Kosovo.
