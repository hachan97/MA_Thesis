Mr. Moungara Moussotsi (Gabon) (spoke in French): I, too, wish to thank His Excellency
Mr. Kanat Saudabayev, Minister for Foreign Affairs of
Kazakhstan and Chairman-in-Office of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE), for his very detailed briefing. We congratulate
him on acceding to the OSCE chairmanship and
appreciate the very useful information with which he
has provided us, especially concerning the OSCE's
2010 programme of work. We note with satisfaction
that these activities are in synch with the goals and
principles of the United Nations.

We also welcome the OSCE's activities in
conflict prevention, which my country believes to be a
contribution to stability and peace. Gabon favours
cooperation between the OSCE and the United Nations
in the area of peace and conflict prevention, pursuant
to Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. The
OSCE's promotion of the implementation of the
relevant resolutions of the United Nations also enjoys
our full support. Furthermore, we welcome the OSCE's
role in stabilizing the situation in Afghanistan, in
cooperation with the United Nations and its agencies
deployed in that country. We are also encouraged by its
initiatives to promote human rights, fundamental
freedoms and the rights of minorities, and by its focus
on the human dimension in its activities. Its promotion
of inter-ethnic dialogue and harmony, and its fight
against intolerance and alls forms of discrimination,
are portents of success in the quest for lasting peace in
Afghanistan and elsewhere.

Like the Permanent Representative of Nigeria,
Gabon wishes to see close cooperation and the sharing
of experiences in the area of stability and peace
between the OSCE and other regional organizations, in
particular those of Africa.
