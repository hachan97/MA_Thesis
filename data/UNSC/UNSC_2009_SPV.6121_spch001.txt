The President (spoke in Russian): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representatives of Chad and the Sudan, in which
they request to be invited to participate in the
consideration of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the consideration of the item, without
the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Allam-mi
(Chad) and Mr. Mohamad (Sudan) took seats at
the Council table.

The President (spoke in Russian): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Dmitry Titov,
Officer-in-Charge of the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Titov to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in response to a letter dated 6 May 2009 from
the Permanent Representative of Chad to the United
Nations addressed to the President of the Security
Council, contained in document S/2009/232.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Dmitry Titov, Officer-in-Charge of the
2
Department of Peacekeeping Operations. I now give
the floor to Mr. Titov.
