The President: I thank the representative of
Israel for his kind words addressed to me.

The order of speaking among members of the
Council has previously been determined by a ballot. In
accordance with the understanding reached among
Council members, I would now request that all
speakers, members of the Council and non-members
alike, try to limit their statements to no more than five
minutes, in order to enable the Council to carry out its
work expeditiously. It would be much appreciated if
delegations that have lengthy statements prepared were
to circulate their statements in writing, and perhaps to
deliver a condensed version in the Chamber.
