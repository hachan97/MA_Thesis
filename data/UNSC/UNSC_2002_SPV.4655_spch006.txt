Mr. Harrison (United Kingdom): Through you,
Mr. President, I should like to thank Deputy President
Zuma for his extremely informative and helpful
presentation. I should like to pay tribute to him and to
his country for their efforts in Burundi and elsewhere
on the African continent. On behalf of my delegation,
let me also welcome Ambassador de la Sabliere to the
Council. My delegation very much agrees with the
points that he made and also with the points made by
Ambassador Strommen.

We very much welcome the ceasefire agreement;
it is a positive step forward. But it will also be
important to follow it up, to implement it and to
continue the negotiations, particularly with the aim of
including the National Liberation Forces (FNL).

Through you, Mr. President, I should like to ask
the Vice-President three quick questions. The first is
how the integration of Forces for the Defence of
Democracy (FDD) into the political process will work
in practice and how it will fit in with plans to integrate
the other two factions that have already signed up -
Jean-Bosco Ndayikengurukiye's National Council for
the Defence of Democracy-Forces for the Defence of
Democracy (CNDD-FDD) and the FNL faction led by
Alain Mugabarabona - and how that will affect the
hand-over to the Transitional National Government's
second phase next May. Secondly, given that it is
highly unlikely that the Burundi armed forces will be
able to return to their barracks and carry out normal
duties while the FNL is still operating, how is it
envisaged that that will be handled? Thirdly, how is it
envisaged that the FDD forces operating outside
Burundi will be included in the process?
