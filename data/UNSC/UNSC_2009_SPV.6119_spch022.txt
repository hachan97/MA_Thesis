The President (spoke in Russian): I thank
Ms. Landgren for her clarifications.

After consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:
"The Security Council expresses its concern
about the current political crisis in Nepal, and
underscores the urgent need for the Government
of Nepal and all political parties to continue to
work together in the spirit of compromise. The
Council notes the steps taken so far in the
implementation of the peace process and recalls
its full support for that process.

"The Security Council reaffirms its full
support for the United Nations Mission in Nepal
(UNMIN) and recalls resolution 1864 (2009)
calling upon the Government of Nepal to
continue to take the necessary decisions to create
conditions conducive to completion of UNMIN's
activities by the end of the current mandate,
including through the work of the Special and

Technical Committees for supervision,
integration and rehabilitation of Maoist army
combatants.

"The Security Council recalls the
Government of Nepal's commitment to discharge
minors from the cantonment sites and calls upon
the Government of Nepal to implement that
commitment in accordance with international
law."

This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2009/12.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 11.45 a.m.
