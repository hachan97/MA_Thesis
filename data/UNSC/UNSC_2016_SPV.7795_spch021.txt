Mr. Rycroft (United Kingdom): Given the pressure
that you are under to defend the indefensible, Sir,
your fantasy world has spread from Syria to Yemen.
Ijust wanted to set the record straight and say that the
United Kingdom did circulate a draft Security Council
statement on Yemen, but its content was to strongly
condemned the attack on the funeral. There was only
one Security Council delegation that did not wish to
support the statement, and that country was Russia.
