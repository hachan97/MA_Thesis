Mr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): We welcome the
adoption of resolution 2314 (2016) and commend the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-
United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM)
for its efforts in executing its mandate based on the
principles of impartiality, objectivity and independence.
All four JIM. reports have proved the importance of
having the Mechanism in the future, since there are
still many cases of possible use of chemical weapons
in Syria, including in 2016, that deserve to be
thoroughly investigated.

We are deeply concerned over the continuous
allegations of the use of toxic substances as chemical
weapons in Syria, which cause enormous suffering
among civilians and are a blatant violation of
international legal norms. Removing the threat of any
use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic
is an essential element in creating proper conditions
for de-escalating tensions on the ground, tackling
extremism and attaining a sustainable political solution
to the crisis in a broader context. The international
community must have full confidence that Syria
has irreversibly abandoned its chemical weapons
programme and that those responsible for organizing
and committing horrible crimes using chemical
weapons as a tool of war are held accountable.

To conclude, I would like to thank the Joint
Investigative Mechanism for its efforts and significant
contributions to deterring any further use of chemicals
as weapons against the Syrian people. My delegation is
ready to cooperate actively and in a constructive way
in order to ensure that the JIM. mandate will be further
extended for a sufficient term in order to execute its
crucial tasks, in accordance with paragraph 1 of the
resolution adopted today.
