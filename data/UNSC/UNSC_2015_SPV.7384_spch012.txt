Mr. Mangaral (Chad) (spoke in French): We
would like to commend the Russian Federation for
initiating today's resolution 2202 (2015), as well as all
the countries that made positive contributions to its
final draft. Chad welcomes its unanimous adoption by
the members of the Security Council, who once again
demonstrated their unity and responsibility in the face
of the gravity of the situation in Ukraine, particularly
in its eastern region. We appreciate the measures
being taken to implement the Minsk agreements, and
in that regard we urge all the parties to begin working
immediately to put the resolution's provisions into
practice in order to arrive at a lasting political solution
to the crisis in Ukraine.
