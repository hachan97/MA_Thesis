Mr. DeLaurentis (United States of America): I
feel I must take the floor to correct the
mischaracterizations we have just heard with respect to
the Defense Cooperation Agreement that was just
signed recently between the United States and
Colombia.

The United States and Colombia on 30 October
signed the Defense Cooperation Agreement, which
facilitates United States access to Colombian bases in
support of mutually approved activities within
Colombia only. The Agreement harmonizes existing
bilateral cooperation in eliminating narcotics
production and trafficking and illicit smuggling of all
types, and augments assistance efforts for humanitarian
and natural disasters. The Agreement explicitly
indicates that all activities will be consistent with the
principles of sovereignty, non-interventionism and
territorial integrity. It has no regional or extraterritorial
application.

We also heard, I am pleased to note, of
Venezuela's interest in international cooperation
against terrorism, which is an issue of global and
regional importance. One of the reasons that we re-
established relations at the ambassadorial level in July
was to ensure a high quality dialogue with Venezuela
on issues of mutual concern, including counter-
terrorism and counter-narcotics efforts. While the
Venezuelan Government has not yet taken advantage of
this opportunity, we are hopeful that its new-found
interest in the topic, as evidenced by this discussion,
will encourage a meaningful dialogue between our
Governments.
