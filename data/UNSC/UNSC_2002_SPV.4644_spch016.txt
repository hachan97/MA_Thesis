Mr. Traore (Guinea) (spoke in French): I had not
intended to speak because I did not have any particular
explanation to give of my country's vote, which I
consider to be legitimate. Our concerns, voiced during
the past six weeks of intense Council negotiations,
were indeed taken into account in this resolution. But,
at this point, I think it would be a good idea to simply
point out that my country welcomes the adoption of
resolution 1441 (2002), particularly the fact that it was
adopted by consensus, which is a clear message to Iraq.
My country considers that that important phase opens
the way for the peaceful resolution of the Iraqi crisis
and reaffirms the unity and the role of the Security
Council as the guarantor of international peace and
security.

My country reaffirms its support for the
inspectors and hopes that they will benefit from the
Iraqi authorities' full cooperation, in accordance with
the mandate entrusted to them by the new resolution.

Finally, I call on the Iraqi authorities to respect
their commitments and to comply with their
international obligations and those that are in the
interest of the Iraqi people.
