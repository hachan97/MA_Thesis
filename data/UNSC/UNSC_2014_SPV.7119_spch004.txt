Mr. Araud (France) (spoke in French): We welcome
the Council's unanimity, which allowed for the
adoption of resolution 2140 (2014). It shows that, when
the Council speaks with one voice in crisis situations,
the establishment of an orderly peaceful democratic
transition is possible.

The resolution we have just adopted sends three
clear messages. First, the Council and the international
community remain fully committed to Yemen and
support a democratic transition that responds to the
aspirations of the Yemeni people. Secondly, the next
stages in the transition are clear - the drafting of a
new constitution, electoral reform and the swift holding
of general elections. The resolution underscores that
it is important to turn the page on the presidency of
Ali Abdullah Saleh in order to move forward in the
transition. Thirdly, the actors that want to derail the
political transition must pay the consequences, and that
is reason for the establishment by the Security Council
of a Sanctions Committee and a Panel of Experts.

With this resolution, the United Nations confirms
its support for Yemen's legitimate and democratic
aspirations at present in the region, and we hope that
it will be able to show the same determination on other
crises under way.
