Mr. Yaremenko (Ukraine): I just want to say a few
words. I do not want to, and I do not have to convince
everybody present about the fact that in Ukraine, we
have been facing Russian aggression for more than a
year and a half. There is so much evidence that it is
absolutely unnecessary to do so.
The only thing that I would like to say to the
Russian Federation is that if we were not forced to deal
with the Russian aggression, no Ukrainian children
would be harmed. So please, take all of your weapons
and money and all of the militias out of our territory
and everything will be absolutely fine.
