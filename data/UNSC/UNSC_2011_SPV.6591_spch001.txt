The President: In accordance with rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite the
representative of Cote d'Ivoire to participate in this
meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2011/458, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by France and the United
States of America.

I Wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2011/387, containing the twenty-eighth
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
Operation in Cote d'Ivoire.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.

A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
Colombia, France, Gabon, Germany, India,
Lebanon, Nigeria, Portugal, Russian Federation,
South Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland and United States of
America.

The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 2000 (2011).

I would like to take this opportunity to recall that
resolution 1000 (1995) was adopted on 23 June 1995.
It is mere coincidence that resolution 1000 (1995),
concerning the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in
Cyprus, was, like resolution 2000 (2011), adopted
under the presidency of Germany. I am sure that I
speak for all members of the Security Council in
paying tribute to all delegations that have served on the
2
Council over the 65 years since resolution 1 of
25 January 1946 was adopted.

I now give the floor to the representative of Cote
d'Ivoire.
