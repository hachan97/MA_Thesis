Mr. De Riviere (France) (spoke in French): My
delegation welcomes the adoption of resolution 1828
(2008) and warmly thanks the United Kingdom for its
efforts to bring the negotiations to completion. France
fully supports the African Union-United Nations
Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) and hopes that
its deployment will progress rapidly and unimpeded.
We stress that the issue of support for UNAMID enjoys
unanimity in the Council, which we welcome. The
situation in Darfur, like that in the border areas of
neighbouring countries affected by the crisis there,
continues to merit the resolute involvement of the
Council. We should spare no effort to ensure that
UNAMID is able to complete its mission.

We take note of the request made, inter alia, by
the African Union to defer the process initiated by the
International Criminal Court. France, for its part, is
deeply committed to the fight against impunity and to
the work of the Court, which should follow its own
course. We continue to appeal for the cooperation of

the Sudanese authorities with the Court, including with
respect to the outstanding arrest warrants against
Mr. Harun and Mr. Kushayb. France also appeals to the
Sudanese authorities and all parties to cease hostilities,
facilitate the work of humanitarian workers, cooperate
with UNAMID and resolutely commit themselves to a
political process under the auspices of the United
Nations and the African Union.
