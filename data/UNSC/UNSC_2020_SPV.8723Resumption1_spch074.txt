Mrs. Zabolotskaya (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We asked for the floor to comment on the statements made by the delegations of Ukraine and Georgia. In all United Nations meetings, regardless of the subject at hand, those delegations continue to level well-known mendacious accusations at my country. We would like to underscore here that repeating such statements does not make them truthful or convincing. The representative of Georgia addressed the circumstances surrounding the independent states of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Those tragic circumstances were connected to the attack of the Saakashvili regime, in power in Georgia in 2008, on the peaceful town of Tskhinvali and on the peacekeepers stationed there, under international mandate. As a result, both civilians and peacekeepers died. To date, Georgia has not taken responsibility for the attack or apologized to the civilians of South Ossetia for the crimes perpetrated. It has continued to attempt to lay its guilt on others. The statement by the representative of Ukraine has also shown nothing new. The delegation persists in hiding the fact that Ukraine continues to wage war against its people in Donbas, thereby violating the Minsk agreements. It also continues to attempt to impede the decision of the people of Crimea, which was taken through a referendum to leave Ukraine, following the violent overthrow of the legal President of Ukraine, achieved with outside intervention. We call on those delegations to make a positive contribution to the work of the Organization and not to consider issues that are not on the agenda of the meeting. The meeting rose at 6.10 p.m.
