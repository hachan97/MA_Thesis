Mr. Taula (New Zealand): New Zealand voted in
favour ofresolution 2333 (2016). This is a critical period
for Liberia. The Council's consideration of the future
United Nations presence in the country was important,
given the considerable gains that Liberia has achieved
in recent years, including taking over full responsibility
for security from the United Nations Mission in Liberia
(UNMIL) earlier this year. Today's resolution rightfy
commends the successful completion of that process.

After 13 years of UNMIL support in the country,
it was right for the Council to consider the next steps
for the United Nations engagement in the country and
to carefully consider the best interests of Liberia itself.
New Zealand saw considerable merit in arguments
made in favour of the United Nations providing support
to Liberia through 2017, including the elections period,
but to bring to an end the current peacekeeping mission.
The current resolution extends the mandate of the
Mission for a final period until 30 March 2018.

New Zealand considers it important that the
Security Council convey two key messages. First, the
United Nations should continue to support Liberia in
a strong partnership as it enters the next phase in its
history. Secondly, UNMIL will rightly withdraw in
early 2018, given that the Liberians have demonstrated
that a United Nations peacekeeping mission in the
country will no longer be warranted in the light of the
significant progress made.

We would echo the concerns expressed about the
process followed in negotiating the resolution. We feel
that more could have been done to bridge the diverging
views within the Council in order to reach consensus
and thereby send a united message to Liberia.

Finally, we again commend Liberia for the progress
made in the country. We wish it continued success in
the important period ahead.
