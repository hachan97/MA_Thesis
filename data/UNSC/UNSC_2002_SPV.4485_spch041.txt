Mr. Kolby: I should like to make just a few brief
remarks.

With the Boundary Commission decision and its
implementation soon before us, I believe that the most
important thing now will be for all of us to look
forward to the important steps ahead. The Ambassador
of the Netherlands referred to some of these steps. I
think that only in this way can we proceed in a
constructive manner.

Secondly, I would draw the Council's attention to
the fact that the two leaders, in their remarks to the
press after our meetings, characterized the mission as
both constructive and timely, and I think these remarks
were repeated by the two countries here today. We
would like to build further on this foundation in the
Council.

Regarding the outstanding issues, the position of
the Council has been clearly expressed on several
occasions, in the presidential statement adopted in
January and reiterated in the report of the mission.
These are well-known requirements, and they should
be adhered to.

Finally, I would like to underline the very strong,
supportive environment confirmed through the mission
to the two countries. The international community will
stand firmly behind the parties in the implementation
of the Algiers Agreements, including the
implementation of the Boundary Commission's
decision. As we have heard today, I think the Council
remains strongly committed to contribute to the
completion of the peace process.
