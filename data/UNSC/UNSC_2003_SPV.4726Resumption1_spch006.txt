Mr. Capelle (Marshall Islands): It is my honour
to address this open meeting of the Security Council. I
would like to express my thanks to you, Mr. President,
for convening this meeting and for once again giving
small delegations such as my own an opportunity to
participate in this crucial debate.

The Republic of the Marshall Islands is a country
of peace-loving people. Both our people and our lands
have suffered from the ongoing effects of weapons of
mass destruction. We have witnessed first-hand the
absolute devastation that can be unleashed by such
weapons. For that reason, we believe that the
disarmament of the Iraqi regime is an urgent priority.
We also support the ultimate goals of the current
operation in Iraq, namely, to ensure Iraqi compliance
with its disarmament obligations and to restore the
sovereignty of the country to its people.

The devastation of war is becoming increasingly
evident to all of us as we watch events unfold in Iraq.
The focus now needs to turn to the humanitarian
requirements of the people of Iraq. We therefore urge
the Security Council to do everything in its power to
ensure that humanitarian aid is delivered quickly and
effectively to those who so desperately need it. Our
energies must be focused on alleviating the suffering of
the Iraqi people.

At this difficult and turbulent time our thoughts
are with the coalition forces, and especially with the
young men and women of the Marshall Islands who
serve in the United States armed forces that are
stationed in Iraq. We wish them all a safe and speedy
return. Our thoughts and condolences are also with all
of those who have lost loved ones in this conflict.

We hope and pray for a swift resolution of this
conflict, and look forward to the establishment of a
new and democratic Iraq free of weapons of mass
destruction - free for its people to live in peace.
