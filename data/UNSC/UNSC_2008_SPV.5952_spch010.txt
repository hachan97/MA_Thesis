Mr. Mantovani (Italy): We understand that the
situation on the ground has considerably worsened
since our meeting last night. As indicated a few hours
ago in an official statement, the Italian authorities are
following with deep concern the crisis situation in the
Georgian region of South Ossetia in close coordination
with ours European partners and other allies.

We call on all parties to immediately cease all
acts of violence and to ensure a lasting cessation of
hostilities. We strongly encourage the resumption of
negotiations in order to achieve a political solution to
the issue respecting the sovereignty and territory
integrity of Georgia. We deplore the fact that not only
does the Olympic Truce remain unheeded, but so did
the appeals made yesterday by several actors, including
the Secretary-General and many members of the
Security Council.

Reportedly, the situation has indeed deteriorated,
and the crisis has broadened. We are seriously
concerned at the reports of high numbers of casualties,
including among civilians and peacekeepers. We have
also learned with deep concern about the displacements
of population. We call for full respect for international
humanitarian law by all parties, including in the area of
the protection of civilians. Humanitarian access must
be granted fully and immediately.

We appreciate all the diplomatic efforts being
undertaken at all levels to defuse the crisis, with
particular mention of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the United States and
the European Union, which are sending envoys to the
area. We reiterate our full support for the OSCE
mission to Georgia and condemn the shelling of its
premises. The parties must lend their full cooperation
to the mission.
