The President: I thank Ambassador Fowler for that
Academy Award-winning movie and his excellent report.
I congratulate him on his difficult mission and on laying
the basis for the reports to come in the future, which will
be of such immense importance.

We now have the Vice-Minister of External
Relations of Angola, after which we will hear from the
other members of the Security Council. The first speaker
after the Vice-Minister - I would like to explain in
advance, so members are all ready - will be Ambassador
Lavrov of the Russian Federation, who will speak on

 

behalf of the troika. After that, other countries will speak.
I will forgo our national statement and simply submit it for
public record if we run out of time because of the pressures
today.

I welcome to the Security Council the Vice-Minister
of External Relations of Angola, Mr. Georges Chicoti and
invite him to make his statement.
