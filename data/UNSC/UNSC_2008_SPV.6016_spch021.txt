Mr. De Mistura: I will be very short in thanking
every member of the Council and His Excellency the
Ambassador of Iraq for the words of support and
encouragement for what the United Nations Assistance
Mission for Iraq and the Secretary-General's team are
trying to do in Iraq. What we have been able to achieve
together with the Iraqi Government has been also
because the Security Council expressed tmst in the
Secretary-General and his team in Iraq eight months
ago, and we will need that trust and support in the next
coming months, because there are challenges ahead.

The meeting rose at 12.30 p.m.
