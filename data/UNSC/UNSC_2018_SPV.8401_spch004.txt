Mr. Adom (Cote d'Ivoire) (spoke in French): My
delegation takes note of the decision by the Security
Council to act under Chapter VII of the Charter of the
United Nations to extend the mandate of the United
Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization
Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA)
until 15 December 2018, on the basis ofresolution 2387
(2017). C6te d'Ivoire welcomes this Council decision,
which makes it possible for MINUSCA to continue
its activities in a country where the magnitude of the
security, political and humanitarian challenges requires
the international community's unconditional support.
In our capacity as Chair of the Committee established
pursuant to resolution 2127 (2013) concerning the
Central African Republic, my country calls on all
Council members to act in a spirit of compromise with
a view to constructive participation in the context of
our adoption of the full draft resolution renewing
MINUSCA's mandate. Cote d'Ivoire firmly believes
that consensus on the draft resolution's relevant
provisions will reflect our support to the Government
and the people of the Central African Republic in their
efforts to emerge from crisis with the aim of restoring
lasting peace and stability in our brother country.
