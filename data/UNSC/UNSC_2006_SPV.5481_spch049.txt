Mr. Lovald (Norway): Norway is following the
dramatic situation in and around Gaza with deep
concern. The situation is very serious. All parties must
exercise the utmost restraint to prevent the situation

from getting completely out of control. The abduction
of the Israeli soldier and the killing of the young Israeli
settler are unacceptable acts which we deplore. Such
acts can only further aggravate the already precarious
situation of Palestinian civilians.

We deeply deplore the arrest of lawfully elected
Palestinian politicians. They need to be released
immediately. Norway has repeatedly condemned
Qassam rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel. Israeli
military operations in that densely populated area are
endangering lives and causing suffering to the civilian
population in Gaza. We therefore call on Israel to
withdraw its forces as soon as possible. Norway is also
deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation in
Gaza caused by Israeli attacks on vital infrastructure.
Such collective punishment is unacceptable.

The current operations raise a number of issues of
international law, whether they are police operations or
military operations. According to international law, any
use of violence shall be necessary and proportionate.
Any countermeasures against the civilian population
are unacceptable under international law. Israel must
now help to restore water and energy supplies in Gaza,
desist from any action that might damage vital
infrastructure and show consideration for the
Palestinian civilian population. Palestinian leaders
have to make every effort to release the kidnapped
Israeli soldier and bring to justice those responsible for
the murder of the other Israeli citizen.

Norway urges the parties to show the greatest
possible restraint and allow time for negotiations so
that a peaceful solution to this serious situation can be
found.
