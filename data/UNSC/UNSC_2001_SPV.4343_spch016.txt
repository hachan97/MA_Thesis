Mr. Ward (Jamaica): I would be remiss ifI did
not mention the valuable work that Matthew Taylor of
the United Kingdom Mission provided to the working
group, and I understand that he is leaving. I hope I
have an opportunity to say this to him directly, but I
will ask Ambassador Eldon to convey to him this
sincere appreciation on the part of the Chair of the
working group and all the members of the working
group for the valuable work of Matthew Taylor of the
United Kingdom Mission.
