Judge Mose: Very briefly, I would like to thank
the members of the Security Council for their
favourable and positive comments on the work of the
Tribunal. We very much appreciate the observations
made. We also take note with appreciation of the
statements made by virtually all members of the
Council regarding the need for all States to cooperate
with the Tribunal, in particular in relation to indictees
at large. The uniform attitude of the Council in that
area will no doubt send a strong signal to the right
circles.

Capacity-building was mentioned by some
speakers. Let me stress that that is a priority area for
the Tribunal and that we will certainly continue and
accelerate our work in that area. We look forward to
the fact that our information centre in Kigali will soon
be expanded, in the sense that there may soon be
similar centres in all regions of Rwanda.

Legacy issues were mentioned by several
delegations. There, too, I think there is a need for
further reflection - not only between the Tribunals,
but also between the Tribunals and Member States, on
how to carry those important issues further forward.
Documents have been circulated, and we need, on the
basis of those documents, to go into the matter in
greater depth in order to make further progress.

In short, the Prosecutor and I will simply take
with us the kind remarks by members of the Council,
and they will certainly serve as an inspiration in our
work over the next six months.
