The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Australia, Indonesia, Japan, Portugal
and Timor-Leste, in which they request to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In accordance with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Guterres
(Timor-Leste) took a seat at the Council table;
Mr. Dauth (Australia), Mr. Hidayat (Indonesia),
Mr. Haraguchi (Japan) and Mr. Santa Clara
Gomes (Portugal) took the seats reserved for
them at the side of the Council Chamber.

The President (spoke in French): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno, Under-
Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Guehenno to take a seat at the
Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. Members of
the Council have before them document S/2003/243,
which contains the special report of the Secretary-
General on the United Nations Mission of Support in
East Timor.

I shall now give the floor to Mr. Jean-Marie
Guehenno, Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping
Operations.
