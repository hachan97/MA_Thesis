The President: There are no more names on the list
of speakers.

I shall now make an additional statement in my
capacity as the representative of Pakistan.

A reference was made earlier today with regard to
the United Nations Military Observer Group in India
and Pakistan (UNMOGIP). No bilateral agreement
between India and Pakistan has overtaken or affected
the role or legality of UNMOGIP. The United Nations
Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan
continues to monitor the ceasefire in accordance with
the resolutions of the Security Council. Its mandate is
therefore fully valid, relevant and operative.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

I give the floor to the representative of India to
make a further statement.
