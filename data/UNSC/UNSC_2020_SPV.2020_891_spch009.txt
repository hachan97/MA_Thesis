First, I would like to thank Ms. Lyons for her briefing. The Niger recognizes the good work of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) in promoting peace, governance and development for the benefit of all Afghans. We are well aware of the importance of the coordination among all United Nations entities and other humanitarian actors in maximizing the effectiveness of Ms. Lyons' actions, especially in these times of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. I would also like to express my appreciation to Mr. Mohseni for his presence and his briefing today. He can be proud of his leadership in the promotion of a free press and of women journalists. As we have reiterated on many occasions, peace in Afghanistan can come about only through a negotiated political solution. In the spirit of seeking peace and stability as a priority, we welcome the latest measures taken by the Afghan Government, including the release of 4,600 prisoners. We hope that all remaining obstacles will be overcome and the way for intra-Afghan dialogue finally opened. Similarly, my delegation would like to stress the need for a reduction in violence, which would contribute positively to peacebuilding and reconciliation in the country. As in any good, negotiated solution, the protection of the constitutional rights of Afghan women throughout the peace process and the preservation of the gains of the past two decades, including human and minority rights as enshrined in the Afghan Constitution, must be protected and strengthened. Inclosing, I would like to stress the importance of the international community's support for the Afghan people, including in development, the humanitarian sector and in the fight against terrorism and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We encourage Afghanistan's friends and donor countries to continue their much-needed support at a crucial moment in the country's history.
