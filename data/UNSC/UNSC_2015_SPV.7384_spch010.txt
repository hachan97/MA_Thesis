Mr. Laro (Nigeria): Nigeria would like to thank the
Russian delegation for the effort it has put into drafting
resolution 2202 (2015), which the Council has just
adopted. We were pleased to see it receive the support
of all Council members. Nigeria believes it is important
for the Council to send a timely and unequivocal
message in support of the efforts of the leaders of
Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany to find a lasting
political solution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine.

We urge all the parties to implement a comprehensive
ceasefire in line with the Minsk agreements. That is a
necessary first step in the search for peace. We stress
that there can be no military solution to the conflict
in eastern Ukraine. The parties should pursue a
political solution through dialogue. It is important
that the separatists' concerns be addressed within
the framework of a political settlement that does not
compromise the independence, unity, sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Ukraine.
