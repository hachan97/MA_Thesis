Mr. Fall (Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs) (spoke in French): The draft annual
report of the Security Council for the period 16 June
2000 to 15 June 2001, to be submitted to the General
Assembly in pursuance of Article 24, paragraph 3, and
Article 15, paragraph 1, of the United Nations Charter,
has been prepared by the Secretariat in line with the
revised format agreed upon by the Security Council in
1974 and further revised in 1985, 1993, 1994, 1995,
1997 and 1998.

The format of the draft report before the Council
provides a guide to the activities of the Council in a
concise manner. It should be noted that, in addition to
the extensive coverage provided in part VI on the work
of the subsidiary organs of the Council, the annual
reports of the sanctions Committees are to be found in
appendix XIII of the report, in accordance with the
note by the President of the Security Council of 30
October 1998, document S/1998/1016. Further,
pursuant to the understanding reached at the Council's
consultations of the whole on 30 November 1998,
statements to the press made by the President following
consultations of the whole of the Council have been
annexed to the monthly assessments prepared by the
former Presidents at their discretion.
As the President has pointed out, the draft report
was circulated by the Officer-in-Charge of the
Department of Political Affairs on 27 August 2001 to
the current members of the Security Council and to the
members whose terms of office expired on 31
December 2000, for review and comments, if any. A
corrigendum containing changes requested by two
Council members and an addition made by the
Secretariat is also before the Council.
