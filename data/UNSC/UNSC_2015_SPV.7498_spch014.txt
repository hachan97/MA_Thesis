Mr. Gimolieca (Angola): Angola abstained in the
voting on today's draft resolution S/2015/562, introduced
by Malaysia, on the establishment of an international
tribunal for prosecution of those responsible for crimes
connected with the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight
MH-17.

At the outset, let me be clear. We condemn in
the strongest possible terms the downing of Malaysia
Airlines Flight MH- 17 over Donetsk, Ukrain, on 17 July
2014 - a tragic event that resulted in the loss of all 298
passengers and crew members on board. We emphasize
the need and importance of holding accountable those
responsible for those acts in order to establish justice
for the victims and their families, to set an example
that acts like those can be punished, and to protect civil
aviation from such intolerable deeds.

Nevertheless, we are convinced that resolution 2166
(2014) continues to be the applicable legal framework
for international cooperation in the interests of a full,
true, definitive and transparent investigation into the
incident in accordance with international civil aviation
guidelines. As the criminal international investigation
is yet not complete, we are ofthe View that, at this stage,

Member States should be engaged in a comprehensive
process of consultations. The Security Council
resolution 2166 (2014) stipulates that the Secretary-
General should identify possible options for United
Nations support to the investigation and report to the
Council on the relevant developments.

We are therefore convinced that the establishment
of a criminal tribunal is a premature solution and that
the most appropriate mode of action would be to wait
for the results of the investigation. We regret that once
again the Council was not able to reach the required
level of compromise for the consensus needed in a text
acceptable to all members.
