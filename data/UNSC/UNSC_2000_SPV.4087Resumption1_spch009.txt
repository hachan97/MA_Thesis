The President: The representative of the United
Kingdom has asked a series of questions that we cannot
leave hanging in the air. I hope future speakers will address
these questions.

The next speaker is the Ambassador of Tunisia, but
before calling on him, I would like to ask Dr. Piot if he
would respond to one specific point that Ambassador
Greenstock raised, and that is the question of a clearing
house. Does one now exist? Do you have a plan? Could
you give us all just a very precise response to that specific
question?
