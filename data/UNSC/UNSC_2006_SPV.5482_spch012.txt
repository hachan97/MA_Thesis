The President (spoke in French): In my capacity
as head of the Security Council mission to the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, I would like once
again to thank the Congolese authorities for the warm
welcome that they gave us. I would also like to thank
10

the United Nations Organization Mission in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo and Bill Swing for
the excellent work the United Nations is doing in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.

I would like to conclude by repeating the words
of Ambassador Ileka of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, who said that his country has a new rendezvous
with history. The international community, in particular
the Council, is mobilized and ready to help the
Democratic Republic of the Congo to succeed.

I believe that I am expressing the view of all of
the members of the Council in saying that we are
determined to remain partners with the Congolese
people after the elections in order to help them with the
process of the recovery of the country.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at I] am.
