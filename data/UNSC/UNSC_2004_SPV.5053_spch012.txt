Mr. Sardenberg (Brazil): Brazil participated in
the consensus on the adoption of resolution 1566
(2004), in view of our firm commitment to counter
terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, without
any qualification whatsoever.

In our view, operative paragraph 3 of resolution
1566 (2004) reflects compromise language that
contains a clear political message, but it is not an
attempt to define the concept of terrorism.

I wish to reiterate our view that the current
practice of the Council is one of excessive resort to the
use of Chapter VII. In that regard, the fact that the
entire operative part of the resolution just adopted
remains under that chapter suggests that not enough
emphasis has been given to the possibilities opened up
by international cooperative action. We believe that
such a tendency is both unnecessary and
counterproductive. It is a matter of specific concern
that the appeal to Member States contained in operative
paragraph 5 is made under Chapter VII.

During our negotiations, I noticed that this point
was raised by several other delegations. In our view, no
constraints should be imposed on States' freedom to
negotiate the terms of international conventions.

Brazil supports the establishment of the
intergovernmental working group to consider political
measures regarding individuals, groups or entities
involved in or associated with terrorist activities, as
foreseen in operative paragraph 9. It is our view that
the need to observe the provisions of international law
and due process should be taken into due account by
the working group.
