Mr. Amon-Tanoh (cote d'Ivoire) (spoke in French):
Cote d'Ivoire welcomes the unanimous adoption of
resolution 2463 (2019), which renews the mandate of
the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO).
We congratulate the French penholder for the excellent
work done, which made compromise possible in the
ongoing quest for a result.

As part of the renewal of the MONUSCO mandate,
which takes place in a post-election environment
marked by the need for stabilization in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, as mentioned, resolution
2463 (2019) assigns two priorities to the Mission: the
protection of civilians and support for the stabilization
and strengthening of State institutions, governance and
reform of the security sector. In View of the fragility
of the situation, the Democratic Republic of the Congo
needs the support of the international community, in
particular the United Nations, to ensure the protection
of civilians against all forms of violence and guarantee
peacebuilding and stability in the country.

It is understood that it is not intended for
MONUSCO to remain in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo. That is why resolution 2463 (2019) provides
for an independent strategic review of the Mission
within nine months, in order to develop a phased and
gradual exit strategy, with the agreement of country's
authorities. Cote d'Ivoire reiterates its full support to
MONUSCO personnel and encourages the Mission to
continue its efforts with a view to restoring peace and
stability in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
