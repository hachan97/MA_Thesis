Mr. Oh Joon (Republic of Korea): On the issue of
the Middle East peace process, the Republic of Korea
has supported the two-State solution as the only viable
way to build a lasting peace in the region. We fully
understand and empathize with the aspiration of the
Palestinian people to have an independent State of their
own. We believe that such an aspiration is in accordance
with the right of the Palestinian people, as embodied
in the Charter of the United Nations. To that end, we
believe that direct negotiations between the parties are
indispensable for realizing two democratic States, Israel
and Palestine, living side by side in peace with secure
and recognized borders. In that process, any unilateral
action by either party will be counterproductive and
hinder genuine progress, especially as paragraph 10 of
the draft resolution S/2014/9l6 calls upon both parties
to abstain from any unilateral actions.

That is why the Republic of Korea abstained in
today's voting. Given the deteriorating situation in the
Middle East, we agree with the Secretary-General's
repeated warning that time is not on the side of peace.
We share the view that the longer the present state of
insecurity continues, the further the path to genuine
peace will be. However, that is all the more reason
for each side to exercise restraint and not worsen the
situation by engaging in a unilateral action. Once again,
we urge all parties to respect previous agreements and
return to the negotiating table to work out a viable
agreement with a two-State solution at its core.
