Mr. J agne (Gambia): It is a pity that things have to
be this way. There is, however, no need to cry over spilt
milk. The die is cast. This morning, when we looked at
the options offered by the Secretary-General following the
latest report of the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM), we thought that they constituted a possible
way out of the quandary in which we find ourselves -
not knowing that it was too late already. It is unfortunate
indeed, and very much so, that force had to be used to
deal with the situation.

Where do we go from here? Perhaps when the dust
has settled, we will be in a better position to see more
clearly how best to proceed with normal business. This
would depend, of course, on whether there is any business
left to do. Whatever the outcome, we would like to see
the unity of the Council restored. If it is not, the ability of
the vital organ of the United Nations, which has the
primary responsibility for the maintenance of international
peace and security, will be seriously impaired.

Having said that, we still believe that Iraq should
resume full cooperation with UN SCOM. and the
International Atomic Energy Agency as required under
the relevant Security Council resolutions. In this way, the
Council can proceed as planned with the comprehensive
review. However, we maintain that any comprehensive
review must take into account the question of Kuwaiti
prisoners of war, archives and other properties removed
illegally from Kuwait during the invasion. We are of the
firm view that the interests of small States must be
protected. This is why we insist so much on this point.

 

We are also mindful of the plight of the innocent
people of Iraq. As far as this issue is concerned, we believe
that there is unanimity in the Council to do everything
possible to alleviate their suffering.

The people in the region also need peace. They have
had so many sleepless nights. The time has now come for
them to have some respite.
