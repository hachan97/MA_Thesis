Mr. Choi Young-jin (Republic of Korea): On 5
July, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea fired
one Taepodong-2 and six Send and Nodong missiles
from its eastern coast.
06-43152

Since early May, my Government has been
closely following the activities of North Korea with
regard to its missiles. Pointing out the inevitable
consequences to follow, my Government repeatedly
warned the Democratic People's Republic of Korea not
to conduct any missile launches. Despite our repeated
warnings, however, the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea proceeded with a series of missile launches.

My Government has expressed its profound
regret over that unacceptable act. It undermines peace
and stability in North-East Asia and adversely affects
inter-Korean relations, not to mention deepening
Pyongyang's isolation from the international
community.

In that regard, my Government appreciates the
efforts of the Council members that resulted in the
resolution just adopted unanimously. We fully support
that resolution. We urge North Korea to refrain from
any further provocative actions, to return to the six-
party talks and to comply with international efforts for
non-proliferation.
