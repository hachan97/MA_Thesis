Mr. Dinh (Viet Nam): At the outset, I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his report (S/2020/123) on the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH). I also want to thank the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General, Ms. Helen La Lime, and Ms. Marie Yolene Gilles for their informative briefings. My delegation wishes to make the following points. First, we are concerned about the multifaceted difficulties and instability in Haiti, which have had an adverse impact on the livelihood and enjoyment of human rights of the Haitian people. In the context of the current political impasse, we call on political parties in Haiti to engage in national dialogue towards compromise and find a peaceful way out of the political impasse for the sake of the sustained stability and development of Haiti. We welcome the convergence of views on a number of important issues, as expressed by delegates during the recent political conference, and urge all parties concerned to make further efforts to overcome remaining differences. Secondly, the Government, Parliament and all political parties bear the primary responsibility to serve the people in the country. In this regard, we look forward to bold and necessary measures by the Haitian authorities to address poverty and socioeconomic instability, prevent violence, organized crime and corruption, and ensure security and the rule of law. Thirdly, we commend the work of the United Nations Integrated Office and United Nations country team in Haiti. In this connection, we call on the international community and countries in the region, to continue to support socioeconomic development in Haiti, especially viable projects boosting job creation, women's and youth empowerment, education, capacity- building. We welcome and look forward to deeper cooperation between the United Nations and Haiti through a new partnership, as the Secretary-General stated recently.
