Mr. Hahm (Republic of Korea): During the course of
the past five years, the United Nations Preventive
Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) in the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, the first of its kind in United
Nations history, has helped restore peace and stability to a
region that had once been mired in inter-ethnic turmoil and
the tragedy of war.

In particular, UNPREDEP has done much to
effectively contain the spillover of conflicts from
neighbouring countries, to promote inter-ethnic dialogue
and to improve the overall human rights situation in the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The Korean
delegation very much appreciates and pays high tribute to

all the UNPREDEP personnel, whose diligent efforts
have made this unique preventive operation a success
story thus far and provided the Macedonian people with
a renewed sense of optimism for the future of their
country.
While the headway made in the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia is certainly encouraging and
surrounding circumstances have improved significantly,
we share the concern of the international community at
the lingering uncertainty and volatility in the adjacent
regions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania and Kosovo,
among others. The concurrent lack of progress in
demarcating borders with the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and the domestic inter-ethnic strain within
Macedonia also warrant further attention,

Bearing in mind the foregoing factors, as well as the
position of the host country, the Republic of Korea
supports the extension of the UNPREDEP mandate and
particularly welcomes the political compromise reached
among members of the Security Council to extend the
mandate for a final period of nine months, My delegation
will therefore vote in favour of the draft resolution to this
effect.

Finally, given the need for a continued commitment
on the part of the international community to peace and
stability in the region beyond this nine-month period, we
strongly hope that the Secretary-General, in consultation
with relevant bodies and concerned countries, including
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia itself, can in
due course come up with an appropriate and viable
successor arrangement to UNPREDEP.
