The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
Permanent Representative of Timor-Leste, in which he
requests to be invited to participate in the consideration
of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity
with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of
the Council, to invite that representative to participate
in the consideration of the item, without the right to
vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Santos
(Timor-Leste) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

At this meeting, the Council will hear a briefing
by His Excellency Ambassador Dumisani Kumalo, the
Permanent Representative of South Africa and head of
the Security Council mission to Timor-Leste.

I would like first of all to welcome the return of
the members of the Council and of the Secretariat who
took part in the mission to Timor-Leste.

I now give the floor to His Excellency
Mr. Dumisani Kumalo, head of the Security Council
mission to Timor-Leste.
