Mr. Buallay (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): Thank you,
Mr. President, for giving me the floor once again in this
interesting and thought-provoking discussion of the
important subject of Sierra Leone. My delegation, both in
the informal consultations and in the debate in this
Chamber, made a proposal regarding the establishment of
a centre in Sierra Leone to provide artificial limbs and
rehabilitation for those who have been disabled. My
delegation made that proposal because of the large number
of war victims in that country. There is a need to
rehabilitate and reintegrate into society those who have
been maimed or disabled so that they will not be a burden
on others. We made our proposal knowing that there are
good centres of that type in developed countries that can
help in this regard, whether directly or through the
specialized agencies of the United Nations.

We hoped that the Secretariat would respond to our
proposal, which would contribute to post-conflict peace-
building in Sierra Leone. That task might fall within the
purview of bodies other than the Security Council, at least
indirectly. In our opinion, that is sufficient reason for the
Secretariat to enlighten us as to which competent body we
should address our proposal to. My delegation would be
grateful for a response from Mr. Miyet.
