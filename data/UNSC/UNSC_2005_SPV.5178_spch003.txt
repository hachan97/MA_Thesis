The President: I thank Ambassador Sardenberg
for his statement.

I invite Council members who wish to take the
floor to so indicate to the Secretariat as of now. I would
also like to encourage representatives inscribed on the
speakers list for today's debate to limit their oral
statements to five minutes and to circulate their full
statements in writing.
