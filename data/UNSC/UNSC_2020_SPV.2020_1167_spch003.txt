We share concerns regarding the process and penholding ahead of this resolution's tabling, falling short of the standards of Council practice. Since little time was given for negotiating this text, Germany would like to clarify in particular one point with regard to language on the Peacebuilding Fund. Germany would like to recall that, based on the Secretary-General's report dated 22 August 2006 and entitled "Arrangements for establishing the Peacebuilding Fund" (A/60/984), which the General Assembly took note of in resolution 60/287, the Peacebuilding Fund is an instrument of the Secretary-General and is managed under his authority. While Germany continues to see great merit in providing voluntary support to security sector reform and governance efforts as an element of sustainable peacebuilding efforts, resolution 2553 (2020) does not affect the Secretary-General's prerogative and authority in the management of the Fund.
