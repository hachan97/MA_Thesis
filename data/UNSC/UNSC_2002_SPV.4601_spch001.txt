The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2002/922, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations.

I should also like to draw the attention of the
members of the Council to the following documents:
S/2002/847, letter dated 26 July 2002 from the
President of the International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda (ICTR); S/2002/842, letter dated 26 July 2002
from Rwanda; and a letter dated 8 August 2002 from
the President of the ICTR, which will be issued as a
document of the Security Council under the symbol
S/2002/923.

It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(5/2002/922) before it. Unless I hear any objection, I
shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Bulgaria, Cameroon, China, Colombia, France,
Guinea, Ireland, Mauritius, Mexico, Norway,
Russian Federation, Singapore, Syrian Arab
Republic, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, United States of America

The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1431 (2002).

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Council will remain seized of the matter.

The meeting rose at 11.10 a.m.
