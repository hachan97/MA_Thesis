Mr. Ndiaye (Senegal) (spoke in French): I would
like to thank you, Sir, for taking the initiative to
convene today's debate on the important issue of
nuclear non-proliferation. I also thank Secretary-
General Antonio Guterres, whose briefing enriches our
discussion and allows us to make our efforts clear.

The issue of nuclear non-proliferation is one of
the world's priorities, as illustrated by resolution 1(1),
the first resolution adopted by the General Assembly,
in January 1946. The goal of that resolution was to
eliminate all atomic weapons. Because it is convinced
about the risk that such weapons pose to the survival
of humankind, my country is in favour of the complete
elimination of military nuclear activities, and not their
mere reduction. Complete elimination is the only way
to save the world from the devastation that would ensue
from the use of nuclear weapons. That alone can ensure
the survival of our world and the future of present and
future generations, by allowing them to live without the
fear of atomic bombs being detonated and in a world
freed from the terror of nuclear disaster.

In addition to such clearly identified threats, there
is also the increased risk of proliferation by non-State
actors, because of the rising incidence of terrorism and
new risks emerging from the ill-advised use of rapid
advances in science, technology and international
trade. In the light of such challenges, my country has
firmly denounced the nuclear test carried out by the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea on 6 January
2016 and several ballistic missile launches, which are
all serious violations of the country's international
obligations, pursuant to resolutions 1718 (2006), 1874
(2009), 2087 (2013), 2094 (2013), 2270 (2016), 2321
(2016). Such actions are a clear illustration that the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea is moving
ahead with its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile
programme and is determined to increase its nuclear
power. This not only poses a threat to the people living
on the Korean peninsula and the region; it is also a
serious breach of the non-proliferation regime. Senegal
therefore calls on the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea to respect its international commitments
and obligations.
In 2016, the Security Council unanimously adopted
two resolutions - resolution 2270 (2016), on 2 March
2016, and 2321 (2016), on 30 November 2016 - which
considerably strengthened previous sanctions against
Pyongyang. Nonetheless, it must be pointed out that
such measures, in addition to the unilateral sanctions
imposed by some countries, have been unsuccessful
in encouraging the country to abandon its military
nuclear ambitions. In truth, none of those sanctions
have prevented the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea from continuing to gradually expand its
nuclear capacity and increase its ballistic missiles
arsenal, which is a flagrant violation of the Security
Council's resolutions and its repeated requests. Senegal
has ratified the main instruments underpinning
international non-proliferation and nuclear security
regime. It also respects States' obligations under
resolution 1540 (2004), whose thirteenth anniversary is
being celebrated today.

Similarly, Senegal has submitted its report on the
implementation of the provisions of resolutions 1718
(2006), 1874 (2009), 2094 (2013) and 2270 (2016).
My county is in the process of finalizing its report on
resolution 2321 (2016), with a view to submitting it to
the Chair of the Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1718 (2006).

It is important that we urge the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea to honour its obligations. Once
again, before concluding, I would like to sincerely
thank you, Sir, for your commitment and that of your
country, through dialogue and diplomacy, to seek
political negotiated solutions to the crises that disrupt
the world's operations. My country's President lauds
your efforts and commitment to find an unprecedented
consensus required to put an end to the serious threats
posed by the actions of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea.
