Ms. Amos: I want to take this opportunity to
thank Member States for the contribution they have
made to the overall aid effort in Haiti and for their
focus on the importance of coordination. In that
respect, we in the Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs are strengthening our operation
in Haiti and our focus on the importance of
coordination among the United Nations, its agencies
and national authorities, with particular stress on
national ownership.

Member States have also focused on the
importance of stable institutions and overall security to
facilitate the aid effort and longer-term development. It
is also important to continue paying attention to the
protection of people from sexual violence. All of these
remain important aspects not only of the humanitarian
response but also of the ongoing development efforts.
