The President (spoke in Spanish): The draft
resolution received 12 votes in favour, 2 against and l
abstention. The draft resolution has not been adopted,
owing to the negative vote of one permanent member
of the Council.

I now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements after the voting.
