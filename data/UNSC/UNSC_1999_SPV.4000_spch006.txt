Mr. Petrella (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): The
situation that brings us here to the Security Council at this
early morning hour is one that does not allow us to
remain silent. Allow me therefore to commend you, Mr.
President, for the speed with which you convened the
Council in response to an urgent request by the
Ambassador of the People's Republic of China, and for
the responsibility and patience with which you have been
directing these discussions up to now.

We have listened with great attention to those who
have preceded us in speaking about this tragic episode.
Undoubtedly, what occurred yesterday at the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade must be profoundly regretted. The
loss of the lives of the Chinese diplomats and the physical
damage have moved us and have aroused in us a sense of
fraternal solidarity with our colleagues. We believe that
it would be very useful and necessary to have more
information in order to clarify what took place, and that
it is therefore important to mobilize an exhaustive
investigation.

Moreover, we sincerely hope that the Belgrade
Government will put itself in a position to enter into
serious negotiations on the crisis in Kosovo, thereby
helping the diplomatic initiatives that are being conducted
by friendly countries. I have no doubt that that is the
sense of the last sentence of the statement made by the
Secretary-General yesterday evening.

In conclusion, allow me to extend to the Government
and the people of China our profound sympathy and our
understanding of their legitimate feelings at this time.
