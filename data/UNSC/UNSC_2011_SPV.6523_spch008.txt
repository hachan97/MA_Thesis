Mr. Messone (Gabon) (spoke in French):
Gabon's position on the issue of Western Sahara is well
known. We have always backed dialogue among the
parties and positions mindful of international law and
regional stability. We wish to recall our commitment to
respect for human rights.

My delegation welcomes the adoption of today's
resolution 1979 (2011) on Western Sahara. This
balanced resolution confirms the importance of the
negotiating process and reiterates the Council's
appreciation for the efforts undertaken by Morocco
since 2006. Gabon also welcomes the resolution's
support for the three initiatives proposed by the
Secretary-General in his report (S/2011/249). These
initiatives will promote a deepening of the negotiations
under way under the aegis of the Secretary-General's
Personal Envoy, Mr. Christopher Ross, to whom we
reiterate our support for his efforts to reinvigorate the
negotiating process.

We believe that the resolution also endorses the
Secretary-General's recommendation as to the need for
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees to continue to address the issue of
refugees in the Tindouf camps. We welcome the
recognition of the efforts and measures undertaken by
Morocco to consolidate and strengthen the promotion
and protection of human rights, especially in Western
Sahara. Gabon remains wedded to the main objective
of promoting a definitive solution to this problem and
to creating conditions conducive to stability in the
Maghreb region.
