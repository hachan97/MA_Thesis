Mr. De Riviere (France) (spoke in French): France
welcomes the adoption of resolution 2489 (2019). I
am delighted that the Security Council succeeded in
demonstrating its renewed support for Afghanistan.

I would like to address my condolences to the
Afghan people for the attack on an electoral rally of
President Ghani last night.

I would like to express France's appreciation to
Germany and Indonesia for their efforts to achieve
a balanced text that provides the tools and political
support that the United Nations Assistance Mission
in Afghanistan (UNAMA) needs. We have heard
Afghanistan's request, expressed in this Chamber,
for the maintenance of a strong and stable UNAMA
presence. The mandate we have just adopted is in line
with previous renewals, but also with the adjustments
that were necessary to support Afghanistan at a crucial
moment in its history, less than two weeks before the
presidential election.

The presidential election must be credible and
transparent. Its winner will bear the heavy responsibility
of leading an inter-Afghan peace process in order to
move forward on the road to peace. But Afghanistan
cannot take that path alone. The international
community's commitment must be unfailing, and it
is that commitment that we have expressed today in
renewing UNAMA's mandate for one year.

UNAMA contributes in an essential way to the
pursuit of lasting peace in Afghanistan. We have
just given it the necessary means to act during this
uncertain time that is beginning by recalling what
constitutes the core of its mandate, namely, support
for peace efforts and the preparation of presidential
elections, the coordination of development aid and
humanitarian assistance and the promotion of human
rights, particularly those of women.

The adoption of this resolution shows that the
international community remains united in supporting
Afghanistan on the path to peace, democracy and
development. France will continue to work alongside
its partners in that regard.
