The President: I thank Mr. Yamazaki for his
briefing. The two briefings, by Mr. Turky Saed, from
the Iraqi side, and by Mr. Yamazaki, from the
Secretary-General's side, complement each other and
will inform the Council's work.

In accordance with the understanding reached in
the Council's prior consultations, I now invite Council
members to informal consultations to continue our
discussion on the subject.

The meeting rose at 10.35 am.
