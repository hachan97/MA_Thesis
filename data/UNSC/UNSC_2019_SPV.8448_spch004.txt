Mr. Schulz (Germany): In accordance with
paragraph 24 (e) ofresolution 1970 (2011), of26 February
2011, I have the honour to report to the Security
Council on the work of the Committee established by
the same resolution. The report covers the period from
6 September 2018 to 18 January 2019.

At the outset, since this is my first periodic report
to the Security Council, let me say that I look forward to
working with all the members of the Committee during
this year. I would like to highlight four developments
relating to the work of the Committee.

First, on 11 September and 16 November 2018,
respectively, the Committee listed two individuals, the
seventh and eighth in 2018, as subject to the travel ban
and assets freeze. Mr. Ibrahim Jadhran and Mr. Salah
Badi were included in the sanctions list for engaging in
acts that meet the sanctions designation criteria.

Secondly, from 1 to 2 November 2018, my
predecessor led a Committee visit to Libya - the first
such visit since the inception of the sanctions regime
in 2011. While the approved terms of reference had
indicated Tripoli and Beida as the two destinations to
be visited, the Committee visited only Tripoli, owing to
the closure of Beida airport. The Chair intends to visit

all areas agreed in the terms of reference as soon as
possible, subject to logistical and security arrangements.
Thirdly, on 5 November 2018, the Security Council
adopted resolution 2441 (2018), through which it
extended the mandate of the Panel of Experts to
15 February 2020. Through the same resolution, the
Council extended the time-bound measures aimed at
preventing illicit exports of petroleum from Libya,
further elaborated the sanctions designation criteria
to include, while not limited to, planning, directing or
committing acts of sexual and gender-based violence,
and called on Member States to report to the Committee
on their implementation of the travel ban and assets-
freeze measures. Following the adoption of resolution
2441 (2018), the Secretary-General appointed six
individuals to serve on the Panel on 2 January 2019.

Fourthly, on 4 and 17 December 2018, respectively,
based on recommendations emanating from the Panel's
2018 final report (see S/2018/812), the Committee
adopted two Implementation Assistance Notices,
entitled "Guidance to Member States on the correct
application of the provisions of the resolutions regarding
the payment of management fees on frozen assets" and
"Guidance to Member States on the application of the
provisions ofthe resolutions regarding the asset freeze in
relation to the payment of interest and other earnings on
frozen assets." With regard to a third recommendation,
concerning the issue of subsidiaries of listed entities
as described in the Committee's Implementation
Assistance Notice 1, the Committee agreed to draw the
matter to the attention of the Council, which is what I
am doing.

During the reporting period, the Committee
approved two requests for exemption from the arms
embargo, under paragraph 9 (c) of resolution 1970
(2011), submitted by Tunisia and the Kingdom of the
Netherlands. Consideration of two additional requests,
previously submitted by Malta under paragraph 9 (c) of
resolution 1970 (2011), and recently submitted by Libya
under paragraph 8 ofresolution 2174 (2014), are ongoing.
With respect to the assets freeze, the Committee
received, and did not object to, three exemption
notifications invoking paragraph 19 (a) of resolution
1970 (2011), submitted by the United Kingdom in
relation to the legal expenses of the Libyan Investment
Authority, Ms. Aisha Al-Qadhafi and the Libya Africa
Investment Portfolio, respectively. The Committee also
provided clarification on a letter invoking paragraph 19
(b) of resolution 1970 (2011), submitted by Switzerland
in relation to the Libyan Africa Investment Portfolio.
The Committee further responded to two requests,
from Malta and Spain, respectively, providing guidance
on the assets freeze.
Finally, concerning the sanctions list, in addition
to designating the two individuals I mentioned earlier,
in September the Committee updated the identifying
information of five previously listed individuals.
The Committee also concluded its consideration of
the delisting requests of Ms. Aisha Al-Qadhafi and
Ms. Safia Farkash Al-Barassi, submitted through
the Focal Point for Delisting, established pursuant to
resolution 1730 (2006). Both individuals remain on
the list.
