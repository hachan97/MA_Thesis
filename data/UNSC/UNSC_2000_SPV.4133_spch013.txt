Mr. Chen Xu (China) (spoke in Chinese): I wish at
the outset to thank Mr. Annabi for his comprehensive
briefing. The Chinese delegation is happy to see that the
situation in East Timor is generally stable. We also
appreciate the great efforts made by the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Vieira de
Mello, and his team under very difficult circumstances. The
task of reconstruction in East Timor is a daunting one.
With the help of international financial agencies, the
United Nations Development Programme and donor
countries, reconstruction is now under way in some major
areas, such as infrastructure, education, public health,
agriculture and telecommunications.

We are also happy to see that the National
Consultative Council is now conducting its work fairly
smoothly. We believe that this is a good way to enable
the local population to participate in the decision-making
process. At present there is a serious lack of skilled
personnel and civil servants, especially civil and judicial
personnel. We hope that the United Nations Transitional
Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) will work even
harder in training the local population in this regard.

We believe that only reconciliation and stability in
East Timor will ensure its reconstruction and
independence. In this respect, some problems and
difficulties remain. We hope that the various parties in
East Timor will continue to work in earnest towards their
solution.

We are concerned about the question of refugees
remaining in West Timor. We hope that UNTAET will
continue to seek solutions to this issue through
consultations with the Indonesian Government. We also
welcome the measures taken by the Indonesian
Government to ensure security along the border with East
Timor.

When Mr. Vieira de Mello visited China in mid-
April, we reiterated China's support for UNTAET. We
will continue to provide personnel and financial assistance
to the extent possible.
