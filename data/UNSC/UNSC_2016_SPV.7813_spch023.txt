Mr. Opeloyeru: Mine is just a vote of appreciation.

Let me express, at the close of this very important
meeting, and also on behalf of the new OIC Secretary
General Yusuf Al-Othaimeen, who was just sworn in a
few hours ago by the Council of Foreign Ministers of
the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, our sincere
appreciation and gratitude for the briefers' profound
contribution and constructive and meaningful insights,
suggestions and advisory opinions on the ways and
means of widening and reaching strategic cooperation
between the United Nations and the OIC in all spheres,
especially on the topical issue of combatting terrorism
and violent extremism internationally.

I also wish to thank United Nations Assistant
Secretary-General for Political Affairs Miroslav Jenea
and Mr. Souleymane Bachir Diagne for the input and
insight that they have added to this debate. The various
suggestions put forward at this meeting will certainly
be taken on board as we update the United Nations-
OIC joint inventory of activities and the matrix of our
joint actions for the current biennium, as well as the
actions to be taken by our generous secretariat and the
respective intervention programmes being undertaken
by our member States. Undoubtedly, we remain
committed to consolidating and expanding the excellent
and flourishing relations between the United Nations
and OIC, in the interest of a peaceful and secure world.

Finally, we have also considered the value of the
fruitful exchanges that we have in the Council, and
for that purpose we fervently look forward to another
briefing session on agreed topical issues of mutual
interest on a sustained and regular basis, perhaps
biannually. That will align with the priorities of the
United Nations-OIC Coordination Meeting, held
alternately every two years at the headquarters of both
organizations, so that we can also benefit from the
traditional and collective wisdom that emanates from
this Chamber.

The meeting rose at 12.30p.m.
