The President (spoke in Chinese): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of China.

As are others, we also are grateful to Assistant
Secretary-General Annabi for his briefing. The Chinese
delegation is relieved to learn that the situation in East
Timor remains stable. We also would like to pay a
special tribute to the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General, Mr. Vieira de Mello, and to his staff
for the great deal of work that they have accomplished
under difficult circumstances.

The Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia recently
visited East Timor. We are under the impression that
the United Nations Transitional Administration in East
Timor (UNTAET) has made tangible progress in the
maintenance of law and order, enacting laws,
rebuilding housing and infrastructure, creating
employment and in training and capacity-building. We
support its work in these areas.

The most pressing problem in East Timor at
present is the serious unemployment situation. The
continuation of this problem will have a negative
impact on the security situation there. We hope that
greater efforts can be made by UNTAET in creating
employment opportunities.

The East Timorese people have high expectations
for the United Nations. When these expectations are
not met, it is understandable that people begin to lose
patience. The United Nations cannot remain indifferent
to the frustration and disappointment experienced by
the East Timorese people. It is necessary for UNTAET
to take measures to allow faster participation of more
local people in the transitional work, so that they can
learn how to govern their own country.

I resume my function as President of the Council.
I shall now give the floor to Mr. Annabi to respond to
the questions raised.
