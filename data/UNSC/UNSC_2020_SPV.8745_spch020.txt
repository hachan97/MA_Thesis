Mr. Pecsteen de Buytswerve (Belgium) (spoke in French): 1 should like to thank Martin Griffiths and Ramesh Rajasingham for their briefings. Belgium shares the serious concerns voiced by all delegations that took the floor before me concerning the recent escalation of violence in Yemen. More than ever before, the political process must resume. Any de-escalation of violence will remain fragile if it is not underpinned by a political process. The talks between Saudi Arabia and the Houthi are a good starting point, but at some point the Government of Yemen will need to be involved in the talks, and the process must be led by the United Nations. The next steps in the political process must be taken as quickly as possible, under the auspices of the United Nations. The process must be inclusive and feature the meaningful participation of women and young people. It must also reflect the ethnic, geographical, social and political diversity of the people of Yemen. As we have heard, the operational environment for humanitarian actors in Yemen, in particular in the north of the country, remains very challenging. All restrictions, obstructions and meddling, which violate humanitarian principles, must be ended. We continue in particular to call upon the Houthi to provide access to the FSO Safer oil tanker in order to allow the situation to be assessed and to avert an environmental disaster. Finally, all the parties must uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law and, where applicable, international human rights law. (spoke in English) Here I should like to add my voice to the farewell remarks addressed to our dear Karen. Yes indeed, we will miss her. It has been both a privilege and a pleasure to work with her around this table, and, like my colleagues, I would like to wish you every success in Washington, D.C.
