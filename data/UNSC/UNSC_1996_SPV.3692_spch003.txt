The President: I thank the representative of Burundi
for the kind words he addressed to my predecessor and to
me.

Let me remind speakers that the Council has agreed
on a new practice according to which speakers are
encouraged to forgo the expression of compliments at the
beginning of their statements.

The next speaker is the representative of Ireland. I
invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make
his statement.
