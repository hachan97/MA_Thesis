Mr. Qassem Agha (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): I apologize for prolonging this meeting. I
know that everyone wants to rest, but I should like to
respond to the remarks made by the representatives of
the regimes of Jordan and Turkey.

With regard to the references made to grave
violations against Syrian children in the northern and
southern parts of my country, and to the mobilization
of Qatari, Jordanian and Saudi intelligence forces
along Jordan's borders with Syria, these issues will be
revealed to be true in due course. Whenever we address
a particular issue, we first document it by gathering
evidence in our strategic analysis centres. If the
Jordanian regime is innocent of these accusations, as
the Jordanian Ambassador claims, time will prove it so.

The information concerning children and the
deplorable humanitarian situation in Jordan's refugee
camps, particularly the story concerning the deaths
of two children there, was reported by the media
agencies of Jordan itself. That is also true of the refugee
camps of Turkey, which are rife with maiming, killing
and displacement.

The meeting rose at 6.50 pm.
