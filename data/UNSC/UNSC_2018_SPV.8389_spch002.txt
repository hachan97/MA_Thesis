Mr. Hickey (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom welcomes the Security Council's agreement
to renew the Libya sanctions regime. In particular,
we welcome the fact that the Council has taken an
important step by expanding the designation criteria to
include gender-based violence. This sends a powerful
signal that the international community will not tolerate
such crimes. Sanctions remain an important tool for
the Council in our work to support the Government of
National Accord and to stabilize Libya. However, they
can be only one part of the solution, which requires full
political reconciliation.

We reiterate our support to the Presidency Council
and the Government of National Accord, headed by
Prime Minister Serraj, as the legitimate executive
authorities under the Libyan Political Agreement. The
Council needs to be ready to take swift action against
spoilers who continue to obstruct peace, security and
stability in Libya. We welcome the tireless efforts
of Special Representative of the Secretary-General
Ghassan Salame and the United Nations Support
Mission in Libya to reach an inclusive political
settlement within the framework of the Libyan Political
Agreement, and we look forward to the Special
Representative's briefing to the Council on Wednesday.
