Mr. Ipo (Cote d'Ivoire) (spoke in French): Cote
d'Ivoire welcomes the adoption of resolution 2491 (2019),
renewing for an additional 12 months the authorization
for Member States to inspect vessels on the high seas
coming from Libya in order to combat the proliferation
of migrant smuggling and human trafficking off the
coast of Libya, and the concomitant risk to human life.
We are grateful to the United Kingdom, as penholder,
for its efforts, and we commend the spirit of compromise
that prevailed during the negotiations and resulted in
our unanimous adoption of today's resolution. It comes
at the right time, given the tragedy we are seeing off
the Libyan coast as migrants attempt to flee inhumane
living conditions in detention centres.

My country welcomes the tangible drop in migrant
flows and persons coming from Libya since July 2017,
a trend linked to the sanctions imposed on the people
involved in migrant smuggling, as well as the effective
implementation of resolution 2240 (2015), authorizing
inspections of vessels. It is important to continue to
implement those measures.

While we welcome the adoption of resolution 2491
(2019), my country reiterates its concern about the
lack of naval assets of the European Union's operation
SOPHIA and the resulting consequences for its ability
to carry out its mission. Limiting SOPHIA's role to
aerial surveillance enormously reduces its ability
to monitor vessels off the coast of Libya. We hope
that the discussions aimed at remedying the problem
will have meaningful results for a lasting solution to
the challenges in combating migrant smuggling and
violations of the arms embargo. Lastly, it is crucial that
we work to find a lasting solution to the crisis in Libya
with the full support of the African Union, which has a
comparative advantage with regard to this issue.
