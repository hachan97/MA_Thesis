Indonesia welcomes today's adoption of resolution 2532 (2020), on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We appreciate the efforts of Tunisia and France, as co-penholders, to facilitate the negotiations. We also commend all Council members for their constructive engagement and spirit of compromise in order to ensure that the Council signals its readiness and unity in dealing with the issue. As the Secretary-General has made very clear, the COVID-19 pandemic is a health crisis with far-reaching effects, including with regard to the maintenance of peace and security. The Council's adoption of this resolution is therefore a welcome, albeit long-overdue, commitment. We voted in favour of the resolution because we believe that COVID-19 has a profound effect on security and humanitarian situations, particularly those on the Council's agenda. It is therefore important to send a strong message to all parties to armed conflict to cease hostilities and engage in a humanitarian pause in order to ensure the delivery of, and access to, humanitarian assistance. This resolution is also an important step towards ensuring an accelerated response to the COVID-19 pandemic in countries and situations affected by armed conflicts and humanitarian crises. It calls for United Nations missions on the ground, including peacekeeping and special political missions, to support host countries and continue performing their mandated tasks while ensuring the safety, security and health of their personnel. Indonesia believes that, given the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, a coordinated international response is necessary. The United Nations must rise to the occasion, and we must show that we support the role of all United Nations bodies in that regard. In conclusion, we would like to salute all front-line personnel at the forefront of the battle against COVID-19, including international health and humanitarian relief personnel.
