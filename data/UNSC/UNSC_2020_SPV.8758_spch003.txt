Mr. Matjila (South Africa): South Africa voted in favour of the resolution to extend the mandate of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya for anadditional 12 months (resolution 2542 (2020)). In this regard, we reiterate that there can be no military solution to the Libya conflict. All Libyan parties, community leaders and non-governmental organizations need to commit to a political dialogue. We reiterate the African Union (AU) Contact Group's concern with the political deadlock and reaffirm that all Mission efforts must be aimed at the Libyan-owned and Libyan-led political process with the support of the United Nations and the international community. We welcome the cooperation between the United Nations and the AU in finding a lasting solution to the Libyan crisis. We reiterate the call by the AU Contact Group for strong cooperation with Libya's neighbours. We also welcome the recent intra-Libyan dialogue hosted by the Kingdom of Morocco in Bouznika and the talks in Montreux, Switzerland, which might contribute to moving the various parties closer to a Libyan-owned and Libyan-led process, which will hopefully lead to a peaceful and durable peace in Libya.
