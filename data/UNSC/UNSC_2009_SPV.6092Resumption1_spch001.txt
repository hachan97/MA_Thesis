The President (spoke in Arabic): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Edouard
Aho-Glele, Chairperson of the African Union Peace
and Security Council.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Aho-Glele to take a seat at the
Council table.

I now give the floor to the representative of the
Czech Republic.
