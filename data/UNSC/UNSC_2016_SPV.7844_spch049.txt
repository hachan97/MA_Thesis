Mr. Saikal (Afghanistan): I just want to make
two points.

First, it is a sad day for diplomacy, as evidenced
by the assassination of Ambassador Andrey Karlov, the
Ambassador of the Russian Federation to Turkey. On
this occasion, let me extend the deepest condolences
on behalf of myself, my Government and the people of
Afghanistan to the Government and the people of the
Russian Federation, and in particular to the family of
Ambassador Karlov, Our thoughts and prayers are with
his family and with the Government and the people of
the Russian Federation. The Russian Federation is a
close neighbour to Afghanistan and we have deep ties.

Secondly, let me pay tribute to the work of
Ambassador Gerard van Bohemen of New Zealand, who
has so ably chaired the Committee established pursuant
to resolution 1267 (1999) concerning Al-Qaida and the
Taliban and associated individuals and entities over the
past two years. He has worked with us very closely. I
take this opportunity to welcome the new Chair of the
Committee, Ambassador Kairat Abdrakhmanov, a very
close friend and the Ambassador of a near neighbour.
I wish him all the best and commit myself to working
closely with him to make sure that the sanctions regime
will be working properly.

The meeting rose at 1.40 pm.
