Mr. Fichtl: I think that is a question which we all
have to ask ourselves: if all of us, as partners, missed
opportunities in Sierra Leone. With hindsight, I think
there were missed opportunities. Are we going to
engage in peace-building in other cases? I might not be
the right person to answer that, as we are talking about
mandate issues, in which we have to coordinate very
closely with the United Nations and with other
partners. Our focus is on development issues, and I
think the question there is whether the development
assistance is targeted in such a way that it contributes
to diminishing the risk of conflict. If a conflict has
arisen, I believe the challenge is not to crowd out the
development partners, but rather to bring them in as
early as possible.

In that context, I should like to make an
observation: I would be a bit careful about expanding
the mandate of peacekeeping operations, for example,
to include rehabilitation and development efforts, but
would rather focus them on their priority mandate and,
on the other hand, try to engage the development
partners as strongly and as early as possible.
