Mr. Van Bohemen (New Zealand): The situation
in Aleppo is devastating, as Special Envoy Staffan de
Mistura made very clear to us yesterday. He warned us
that we are facing a situation not dissimilar to those in
Rwanda and Srebrenica, atrocities the Council signally
failed to prevent. We must learn our lessons; we must
stop the destruction of the entire city of eastern Aleppo.

Terrorism is a scourge to the world, but it is not
acceptable that Russia and Syria use counter-terrorism
as a pretext for a large-scale bombing campaign for
which civilians are paying the greatest price. Whatever
the sins of the hundreds or thousand plus terrorists
in eastern Aleppo, that cannot justify the prolonged
bombardment of 275,000 civilians.

We had hoped that the Council would have been
able to come together on a text that all parties could
accept and that could stand a chance of contributing
to practical and constructive action on the ground.
The failure of today's draft resolution, contained in
document S/2016/846, contributes to the polarized
dynamic on Syria among the major Powers and
undermines the credibility of the Security Council.

Given the recent breakdown of the cessation of
hostilities and the curtailing of diplomatic efforts
by the United States and Russia, it is vital to use all
multilateral channels, particularly the Council, to move
the parties away from the killing and back towards
the negotiating table and, in the meantime, to spare
the Syrian people and allow them the humanitarian
assistance they so desperately need.

The Council has a special responsibility. We will
continue to talk with other Council members to explore
what action might be possible in the coming days.
