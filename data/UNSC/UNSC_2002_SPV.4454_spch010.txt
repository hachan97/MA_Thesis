The President: Before giving the floor to the
next speaker, I wish to inform members of the Council
that I have just received a letter from the Secretary-
General informing me of his intention to appoint
Mr. Michael Steiner of Germany as his Special
Representative and Head of the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo. Arrangements are
being made to circulate this letter to the Council
members, together with a draft reply to the Secretary-
General.
