Mr. Cardi (Italy): Italy voted in favour of draft
resolution S/2017/1060, as it reaffirms the well-
established principles and messages that are already
enshrined in several resolutions on the issue of
Jerusalem. The text is consistent with Italy's position
on the matter. As we said at the emergency Security
Council meeting on 8 December (see S/PV.8128), we
believe that the status of Jerusalem as the future capital
of two States needs to be negotiated between Israel and
Palestine, within the framework of a peace process that
will eventually lead to the establishment of two States
living side by side in peace and security, taking into
account the legitimate concerns and aspirations of
both parties.

We also supported the draft resolution because it
opens up a political horizon rooted in the two-State
solution and in the intensification of international and
regional efforts for a comprehensive, just and lasting
peace in the Middle East. In that regard, we continue to
see a crucial role to be played by the United States. We
look forward to hearing the views of the United States
Administration on possible proposals for an Israeli-
Palestinian settlement, while building on the extensive
contacts and intense dialogue developed with all parties
over the past year.

At the same time, we reiterate our deep concern
about the increased tension over the past weeks, and
we reaffirm our firm condemnation of the latest rocket
attack against Israel. An escalation of violence would
be negative for all parties and must be prevented. We
call on all actors in Palestine and in the Middle East to
show responsibility and to exercise restraint. The only
way forward is through negotiations and the rejection
of violence.
