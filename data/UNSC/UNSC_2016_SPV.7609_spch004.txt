Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We are pleased, Sir, to see you presiding
over the Security Council today. We also welcome the
participation in today's meeting of Foreign Minister
Maria Angela Holguin Cuellar.

We note the major significance of the agreements
signed in Havana on 23 September 2015 by Colombia's
President, Juan Manuel Santos Calderon, and the
leader of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de
Colombia (FARC) rebel group, Timoleon Jimenez,
on the timetable for a final peace agreement, as well
as the joint communique of 19 January agreed on by
both sides, which requests international support for the
peace process, including the establishment of a United
Nations mission, which is what we have done in today's
unanimous resolution 2261 (2016).

We believe that the countries of the Community
of Latin American and Caribbean States will respond
positively to the parties' request that they provide the
mission with unarmed observers. We commend these
important agreements and the diligent and determined
efforts of the representatives of the Government of
Colombia and of the FARC, as well as the active
contributions made to the negotiating process by the
guarantor countries - Cuba and Norway - and the
observer countries, Venezuela and Chile. We take
special note of Cuba's role in the process of working out
mutually acceptable solutions to the complex problems
facing the participants.

In Moscow we have followed the progress of the
negotiations attentively and with interest, and have
consistently supported bringing to a speedy conclusion
the peace process aimed at ending Colombia's half-
century of internal armed conflict. We are sure that
the agreements that have been reached, along with the
resolution adopted today, will be important milestones
on the country's road to peace and will enable it to
achieve a final settlement and implement it effectively.
