Mr. Kvelashvili (Georgia): I thank you,
Mr. President, for allowing me to take the floor
for a second time this afternoon. I am making this
statement in response to the statement just made by the
representative of the Russian Federation.

The day is coming to an end and it really does not
give me any pleasure to engage in a discussion that
drags us far away from the topic of today's debate.
Unfortunately, instead of contributing to a meaningful
discussion, Russia yet again tried to put forward a
misleading interpretation of the facts that on numerous
occasions have been reflected in relevant documents
adopted by various international and regional
organizations, including the Security Council. I only
offered the experience of my country as a case study
to provide lessons learned so that the international
community can draw appropriate lessons for its future
work from the difficulties and tragedies we have
endured. We believe that is what we should be debating
and reflecting upon.
