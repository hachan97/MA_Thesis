Mr. Van Oosterom (Netherlands): We voted in
favour of resolution 2414 (2018). The fact that it could
not count on the unanimous support of the Council
should not distract us from what is truly important,
namely, the relaunching of the political process. This
is something that I believe we all support, because it is
in the interest of the people, the parties and the wider
region that this conflict be resolved.

Our common ambition therefore must be to arrive at
ajust, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution
that will provide for the self-determination of the people
of Western Sahara in the context of arrangements
consistent with the purposes and principles of the
Charter of the United Nations.

In this regard, we reiterate our full support for the
efforts of the Personal Envoy, the former President
of Germany, Horst Kohler. We call on the parties to
continue to engage with the Personal Envoy in good
faith, and we emphasize the need to resume negotiations
without preconditions.

We recognize the importance of the work of the
United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara in maintaining stability on the ground and in
creating the conditions necessary for political progress
to take place, and we commend the work of Special
Representative of the Secretary-General Colin Stewart.

We also express our full support for the Mission
and for the women and men serving under very
challenging conditions.
