Mr. Zhang Yesui (China) (spoke in Chinese):
Thank you very much, Mr. President, for your
heartwarming remarks. I am greatly honoured to be
appointed as Permanent Representative of China to the
United Nations. This provides me with an opportunity
to work together with all my colleagues here. I
understand that, in working in this Chamber, we are
undertaking the task of maintaining international peace
and security with the trust of all the Member States of
the United Nations. Only by making concerted efforts
and sincerely cooperating can we achieve the tasks
before us.

I know that all my colleagues here had very good
cooperative relations with my predecessor, Ambassador
Wang Guangya. I am confident that members will
continue to be very generous in providing full support
to me and to the Chinese Mission to the United
Nations. That will be especially important next month,
when China will assume the presidency of the Security
Council. I hope to have very good cooperation with my
colleagues here and expect to enjoy full support and
cooperation from the Council and the Secretariat.
