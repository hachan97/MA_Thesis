Ms. Murmokaite (Lithuania): Let me thank the
Nigerian presidency for convening this open meeting,
which does not cease to surprise us, judging by some
of the statements we have heard. I might refer to some
of the comments by our colleague from the Russian
Federation. I would also like to thank Under Secretary-
General Jeffrey Feltman for his briefing.

As so many of us have said here, the international
community had placed high hopes on international
mediation and monitoring efforts and on the 17 April
Geneva statement on Ukraine. But, as we know today,
the Geneva statement is just another document to be
signed and discarded by Russia, adding to the growing
list of breaches of Russia's international commitments,
such as the Helsinki Final Act, the 1991 Almaty
Declaration, the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, the
Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between Russia
and Ukraine of l997 and the Charter of the United
Nations itself.

Despite growing provocations, the Ukrainian
authorities have taken a number of concrete steps
to follow up on the Geneva statement. Barricades
in Maidan Square are being dismantled. I recall my
French colleague referring a number of times to the
Internet and Google. Users of those will see that there
is a significant difference in terms of what is happening
on the streets of Kyiv. As I said, barricades are being
dismantled. The Kiyv city administration building has
re-opened, as has the main thoroughfare of the city,
Khreschatik.

Important proposals regarding the status of the
Russian language, amnesty, greater rights for the
regions, as well as limitations on the President's power,
have been put forward by the transitional Governmet.
Indeed, as Ambassador Churkin referred to earlier
today, constitutional reform was being discussed by the
Parliament in a public session accessible to all. There
has been a major debate on what was being proposed.
But, again, a major debate that includes criticism
is a sign of democracy. Unanimous decisions and
acceptance of whatever is put on the table is something
that abelongs to regimes, not democratic Governments.
We therefore welcome the discussion. It is necessary
and it is something Kyiv has to do, and should be doing
actively while involving all the regions and populations,
because it affects the lives of the entire population of
Ukraine.

Other issues discussedtoday include decentralization,
constitutional reform, checks and balances, the powers
of the President in the future, a stronger role for and the
reinforcement of the independence of the judiciary, and
so forth. Preparations are taking place for the national
elections to be held on 25 May.

In a stark contrast to those efforts, armed
separatists, aidead and abetted by Russia, are
continuing their assault on Ukraine, adding violence
to force and lawlessness to impunity. As many noted
earlier, yesterday and today saw more violent attacks
in the city of Luhansk and elsewhere - in Mykolaiv
and in Konstiantynivka - where men armed with clubs
and metal bars smashed windows and doors. A pro-
unity rally was attacked by men in military fatigues,
leading to over a dozen injuries among pro-Ukrainian
protesters. A few days ago, a Ukrainian helicopter
was downed by a rocket-propelled grenade, hardly a
weapon so-called peaceful protesters - as labelled by
the Russian side - can buy at the local corner market.
That certainly does not sound like the implementation
of Geneva agreement by the separatists and their state
sponsors?

Displays of brutal force, beatings, disappearances,
torture, killings and hostage-taking have become a daily
reality in eastern Ukraine under militant separatist
rule. While quick to condemn and brand Ukrainian
authorities for alleged crimes, Russia has yet to issue
a single condemnation of the violence carried out by
armed separatists. The legitimate right of Ukraine, to
which our Australian colleague has referred, to defend
its territory and its State has been exercised with
incredible restraint and caution, although portrayed by
the Russian propaganda machinery as a bloodbath and
a valid cause for intervention.

From the speaker before me, we heard references to
military punitive operations and acts. If what Ukraine
is carrying out in the eastern part of its country is
a military punitive action, it is probably the most
invisible, impossible military action on Earth. Nothing
has happened in that sense. To exaggerate to such an
extent is going a long way in terms of exaggeration.
On the other hand, in a threatening tone, Russia
recently ordered Ukraine to withdraw Ukrainian troops
stationed on Ukraine's own soil, or else - so much for
respect for Ukraine's international sovereignty.

We firmly reject all of Russia's attempts to validate
its intentions and threats to use armed forces or to
send so-called Russian peacekeepers into Ukraine.
As a permanent member of the Security Council,
Russia should know better than to exploit the name of
peacekeeping to cover up its aggressive expansionist
aims.

Now I would like to turn to human rights and the
media. The Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe (OSCE) Representative on the Freedom of
the Media, Mr. Dunja Mijatovic', is sounding increasing
alarm regarding the treatment of journalists and the
deterioration of media freedom in eastern Ukraine.
In areas under the control of pro-Russian militants,
journalists are attacked, detained, harassed and
their equipment taken or smashed. There is probably
something to hide if there is such a distaste and dislike
of free media in that part of Ukraine. We reiterate our
call to end impunity for attacks against journalists. We
also call for a thorough investigation of kidnappings,
torture and killings, committed by whomever, and to
insist that the perpetrators of all such acts be brought
to justice.

We hope that the next report of the United Nations
human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine, to be
issued in mid-May, will address the growing cases
of human rights violations, violent deaths, causes for
torture, abductions and activist disappearances in
eastern Ukraine. We also hope the report will look
into the human rights situation in occupied Crimea. As
has been reported, the Crimean Tatar leader Mustafa
Dzhemilev has been barred from returning home to
Crimea. A group of camouflage-clad men stormed the
Tatar Assembly offices and tore down the Ukrainian
flag there. The director and editor of Crimean Tatar
programmes on Crimean State television have been
forced out by local authorities because they had spoken
against increasing censorship.

A new level of banditry by the separatists in
eastern Ukraine was reached on 25 April, when they
kidnapped a group of OSCE representatives. Notably,
when asked to release the hostages, the separatists
were quoted as saying that they needed to speak to
the competent authorities in the Russian Federation.
My delegation strongly condemns the kidnapping of
unarmed OSCE military verification mission observers
and Ukrainian security personnel. Such acts, as well
as the public parading of the hostages, speak loudly
to the true character and intentions of the separatists,
who seek to disrupt international observation so that
they can continue attacking Ukraine out of sight of the
international community.

The parties with influence on the militant
separatists, first and foremost Russia, must take all
necessary steps to bring about the immediate release of
all hostages, without preconditions. The international
monitoring and mediation efforts of the United
Nations, OSCE and other regional bodies must be fully
supported, guaranteed safety and security, and allowed
full freedom of access on all of Ukraine's territory.

As Ukraine prepares for the 25 May nation-wide
elections, those opposed to Ukraine's independence,
sovereignty and territorial integrity are at it again. To
quote the self-proclaimed people's mayor of Sloviansk,
Vyacheslav Ponomarev, "We will take all necessary
measures so that elections do not take place in the
south-east". When asked what they would be ready to
do, he said: "We will take somebody hostage and hang
them up by the balls. It is real, you understand?"

The intent here could not be more clear - it is to
prevent Ukraine's return to normality. We all understand
that there are legitimate complaints in south-eastern
Ukraine, borne out of decades of mismanagement
and corruption and misrule, including the rule of the
previous President, Yanukovych, who fled the country
in disgrace. It is time for the current Government to
start seriously addressing issues of socioeconomic
development because a lot of that discontent is based
on the socioeconomic concerns of the population.
Once those issues are addressed, the level of so-called
separatism, I am sure, will diminish. That should not
happen, according to some, because it would go against
the scenario.

My Government condemns the actions of armed
separatists and their external sponsors, aimed at further
undermining and threatening the territorial integrity,
sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. The onus is
now on Russia to stop interfering in Ukraine's internal
affairs and fomenting unrest in Ukraine, and to abandon
its threats of the use of force. Ukraine is doing its part
to implement the Geneva agreement on Ukraine. It is
time for Russia to live up to its own commitments and
to reclaim respect for the Charter of the United Nations
and international law.
