Mr. Hasmy (Malaysia): My delegation also supports
the draft resolution on an extension of phase VI of the oil-
for-food programme for a period of two weeks. It is our
hope, indeed our expectation, that we will be able to make
a breakthrough on the larger issue of Iraq following the
intense and intensive consultations among some members
of the Council. In this regard, while we support the draft
resolution before us, we see no linkage, in terms of the
time-frame, between this exercise and the decision on the
omnibus draft resolution, which should be brought to the
Council for full discussion by all member States of the
Council for an eventual decision that ought to be taken on
the basis of unanimity among all members of the Council.
Only a consensus resolution would provide a basis for final
resolution of the problem, and we encourage the permanent
members to intensify their negotiations with a view to
bringing the issue back to the Council.
