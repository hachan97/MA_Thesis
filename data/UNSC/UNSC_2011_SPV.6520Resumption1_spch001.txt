The President (spoke in Spanish): I would like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran, in
which he requests to be invited to participate in this
meeting. Unless I hear any objection, I invite that
representative to participate in this meeting.

I wish to remind all speakers to limit their
statements to no more than four minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.

I now give the floor to the representative of Saudi
Arabia.
