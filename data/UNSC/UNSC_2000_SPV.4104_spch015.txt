Mr. Kasse (Mali) (spoke in French): Mali will vote
in favour of the draft resolution before the Security
Council concerning the deployment of the second phase
of the United Nations Organization Mission in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC). The draft
resolution expresses the commitment of the United
Nations and the Organization of African Unity to peace
and security in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Mali welcomes the decision to deploy the second
phase of MONUC. The deployment will consolidate the
Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement and serve to prepare the
third phase of MONUC. We hope that the latter
deployment will be larger and more appropriate to the
nature of the terrain and have a more robust and broadly
expanded mandate. The task before us is herculean. With
this draft resolution, our Organization will certainly make
its contribution to that effort. Mali encourages all the
parties to the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement to honour their
commitments and to cooperate closely with MONUC in
the implementation of the draft resolution.

The international community is listening to us. The
civilian populations of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo and the entire region are watching and awaiting us.
