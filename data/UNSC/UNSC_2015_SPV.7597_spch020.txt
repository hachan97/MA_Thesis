Mr. Gimolieca (Angola): I will be very brief. At
the outset, we would like to thank Ambassador Roman
Oyarzun Marchesi for his briefing, which contained
relevant information.

Like other delegations, we are concerned about
the possibility that non-State actors may manufacture,
acquire, possess, develop, transport, transfer or
use weapons of mass destruction and their means
of delivery, in particular for terrorist purposes. We
therefore agree with the idea contained in the briefing
that the world should prevent a surprise terrorist attack,
especially one using weapons of mass destruction.

As a member of the Security Council, Angola
reiterates its willingness to work with the Committee
towards the implementation of resolution 1540 (2004).
