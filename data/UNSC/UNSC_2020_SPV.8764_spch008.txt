Mr. Allen (United Kingdom): You, Mr. President, asked for a briefer under rule 39. A number of us have objected. I think that it is for you, Sir, either to withdraw your proposal to invite that briefer or to put your proposal for that briefer to the vote. I would not presume to tell you what language you should use.
