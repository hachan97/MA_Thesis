The President (spoke in French): May I remind
speakers to kindly limit their statements to no more
than four minutes in order to enable the Council to
conduct its work in a timely fashion. Delegations with
lengthy statements are asked to circulate written texts
and to deliver an abridged version when speaking in the
Council Chamber. Speakers are also asked to deliver
their statements at a reasonable pace so as to ensure
accurate interpretation. Given the high number of
speakers, our debate will continue through the lunch
hour.

I now call on Mr. Raymond Tshibanda
N'Tungamulongo, Minister for Foreign Affairs,
International Cooperation and Francophonie of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.
