Mr. Tarrisse da Fontoura (Brazil): My
delegation would like to welcome His Excellency
Mr. Didace Kiganahe, Minister of Justice of Burundi,
and to thank him for taking the time to come to New
York to state his Government's views on the
recommendations of the Kalomoh report (8/2005/ 158).
I also wish to express our appreciation for the briefing
by Mr. Ralph Zacklin, Assistant Secretary-General for
Legal Affairs.

Brazil believes that there is a very broad
consensus, including among Council members,
regarding the need to fight impunity in Burundi,
particularly because the Burundians themselves
understand that the quest for truth and justice is an
essential part of their peace and reconciliation process.
The consensus covers also the timing for action: we
should move forward in a smooth and prompt way. In
that context, we expect that the authorities in Burundi,
members of the current Transitional Government and
those who will be elected in the near future will
cooperate fully with the international community, and
in particular with the Secretary-General and his Special
Representative. At the same time, we hope that the
Council and the international community at large can
act in a timely manner, providing the guidance and
assistance required by the Burundians and also
upholding their commitment regarding the
implementation of the recommendations of the
Kalomoh report, including their financial aspects.

To sum up, I would encourage the Transitional
Government to maintain its commitment to the
transitional process in Burundi and would convey to all
parties concerned that peace and development can be
promoted by putting an end to impunity for crimes
committed in that country.
