The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank
Mr. Ramtane Lamamra, Commissioner for Peace and
Security of the African Union, for his briefing.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers
to limit their statements to no more than five minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing and to
deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.

I now give the floor to Her Excellency
Ms. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, Minister for Foreign
Affairs of South Africa.
