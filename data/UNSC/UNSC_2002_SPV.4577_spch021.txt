The President: I thank you very much,
Ambassador Aguilar Zinser, for reflecting on learning
points related to sanctions issues.

We are now going to move on to a number of
speakers all of whom have been allocated five
minutes - of which I am gently reminding our
speakers before they start. I would like to welcome
very warmly the President of the Economic and Social
Council. The fact that he is addressing us today is a
very good example of the kind of coordination that we
have been talking about, and I give him the floor.
