Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
is deeply concerned about the current situation in
Ukraine. We condemn the recent extreme and violent
acts in that country. We have urged all sides in Ukraine
to peacefully resolve their internal differences within
a legal framework and conscientiously to protect the
legitimate rights and interests of all peoples in Ukraine
so as to restore normalcy to the country as soon as
possible.

China consistently stands for the principles of
non-interference in the internal affairs of any country
and of respect for Ukraine's independence, sovereignty
and territorial integrity.

There are reasons why the events in Ukraine have
progressed to where they are today. China will follow
closely the developments on the ground and calls on all
sides to find a political solution through dialogue and
negotiations on the basis of respect for international
law, the principles of international relations and the
maintenance of regional peace and stability.
