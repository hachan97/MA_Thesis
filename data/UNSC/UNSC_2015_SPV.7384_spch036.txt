Mr. Sergeyev (Ukraine): I am sorry, Mr. President,
but what we have heard from our colleague is
unacceptable. Our leaders met in Minsk and they
made very clear statements. They supported very clear
provisions, and we cannot agree with the interpretation
of the Minsk agreements that has been heard from the
Russian side. I am so sorry, but we are not here to launch
a third round of Minsk negotiations and reinterpret
what our leaders agreed upon.
