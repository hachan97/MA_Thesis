The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as the representative of Indonesia.

We note that the request from the Russian delegation
was addressed to the Council. In accordance with rule
2 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure, "[t]he
President shall call a meeting of the Security Council at
the request of any member of the Security Council". The
President has done so in previous cases, as requested by
various members of the Council.

At the same time, we strongly believe that the
discussion in the Council can be efficient and effective
only if all Council members have had enough time to
consider all developments in the field. Moreover, the
discussion can be effective and productive only if all
members of the Council are united in the decision to
proceed with the discussion.

Based on those considerations, we abstained in the
voting on the provisional agenda of this meeting.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

There are no more names inscribed on the list
of speakers.

The meeting rose at 3.50 pm.
