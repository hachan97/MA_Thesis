The President (spoke in French): There are no
more names inscribed on the list of speakers.

Before adjourning the meeting, as this is the
last scheduled meeting of the Council for the month
of October, I would like to express the sincere
appreciation of the delegation of France to the members
of the Council, especially my colleagues the Permanent
Representatives and their respective staff, and to the
secretariat of the Council for all the support they have
given to us. Indeed, it has been a busy month, and one in
which we have been able to reach consensus on several
important issues within our purview.

We could not have done it alone or without the
hard work, support and positive contributions of every
delegation and the representatives of the Secretariat,
as well as all relevant conference service officers,
interpreters and translators. As we end our presidency,
I know I speak on behalf of the Council in wishing the
delegation of Italy good luck in the month of November.

The meeting rose at 6.20 pm.
