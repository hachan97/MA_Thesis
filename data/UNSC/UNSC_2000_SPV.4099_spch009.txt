The President (spoke in Spanish): Before proceeding
to the vote on the draft resolution, I must point out,
especially to the delegation of Sierra Leone, that I had
intended to speak in my national capacity, but in view of
the lateness of the hour, I will convey those words to the
Council in writing.

I now put to the vote the draft resolution contained in
document S/2000/34.

A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, China, France,
Jamaica, Malaysia, Mali, Namibia, Netherlands,
Russian Federation, Tunisia, Ukraine, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America

The President (spoke in Spanish): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1289 (2000).

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of

its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 1.40 pm.
