The President: I would indeed ask Mr. Annabi to
convey to Ambassador Morjane our very best wishes
for a speedy recovery. The Council has already sent
him a get-well message, and we are looking forward to
his quick recovery and to his being able to join us so
that we can interact with him.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council will remain seized of the matter.

The meeting rose at 4.40 p.m.
