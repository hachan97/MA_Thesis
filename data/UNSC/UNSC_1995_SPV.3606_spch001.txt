The President (interpretation from Russian): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on the agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General on the situation in Tajikistan,
document S/ 1995/ 1024. Members of the Council also have
before them document S/ 1995/ 1032, which contains the text
of a draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations.

It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Argentina, Botswana, China, Czech Republic,
France, Germany, Honduras, Indonesia, Italy,
Nigeria, Oman, Russian Federation, Rwanda, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America

The President (interpretation from Russian): There
were 15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 1030 (1995).

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

I should like to announce that consultations of the
Security Council will take place today at 3 pm. I wish to
thank all members of the Council for their patience and
all members of the Secretariat staff, including the
interpreters, for the time they have given us.

The meeting rose at 1.20 pm.
