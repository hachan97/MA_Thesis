Mr. Mbabazi (Uganda): I wish, belatedly, to pass
on our condolences to the bereaved families of the six
workers of the International Committee of the Red
Cross who died in eastern Congo and to inform this
Council that the Uganda People's Defence Forces have
undertaken to help in the effort to investigate and trace
those who are responsible for committing this crime.

I would also like to inform this Council that, two
days ago, on 1 May, at the border of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and Uganda, at about 6 pm.
local time, a truck full of local people was coming
from the market on the other side and was attacked,
presumably by the Interahamwe. The local Muslim
leader and his wife were killed, as were two
businessmen, while three others were wounded. This is
very close to the place where, in 1999 - in March, I
believe - eight tourists and a Ugandan game park
warden were killed by the same forces. I felt that I
should give this Council that information so that it may
be informed about the situation in the border area.

Finally, I would simply want to say that I will not
respond to the statement made by the gentleman from
Sudan, for fear that people may not be able to tell the
difference between us.
