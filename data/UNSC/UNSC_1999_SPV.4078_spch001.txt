The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of
Sierra Leone in which he requests to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's
agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose,
with the consent of the Council, to invite that representative
to participate in the discussion without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Kamara (Sierra Leone) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: In accordance with the understanding
reached in the Council's prior consultations, and in the
absence of objection, I shall take it that the Security
Council agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Bernard Miyet,
Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
I invite Mr. Miyet to take a seat at the Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the first
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), document
S/l999/l223.

I now give the floor to the Under-Secretary-General
for Peacekeeping Operations, Mr. Bernard Miyet.
