Mr. Miranda (Angola) (spoke in French): I
would like to thank you once again, Mr. President, for
giving me the floor. I have asked to take the floor to
make a brief statement, namely, to thank all the
members of the Council and those who have spoken
here. I would also like to express the gratitude of my
Government for the quality of the debate and in
particular for the reference repeated by all speakers to
the need to increasingly isolate Mr. Savimbi in order to
prevent him from continuing to wage war against his
own people. At any rate, what we have seen here is a
demonstration of solidarity. We hope that future
debates will be even more enriching. Above all, the
Council should contemplate appropriate measures -
so-called secondary measures - against countries or
entities that continue to violate the sanctions imposed
against UNITA.

Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to
shed some light on the statement just made by the
representative of Rwanda with regard to what he
referred to as a consultation between the Governments
of Angola and Rwanda at the time of the transit of their
troops through Angolan territory. This does not
correspond to the truth. During the westward retreat of
Rwandan troops from Congolese territory i which
came after, shall we say, the pursuit carried out by our
authorities on Congolese territory some three years
ago - those troops were in fact in the north of our
country, in territory under UNITA control. That transit
was carried out with UNITA coordination. There was
never any contact between Rwanda and Angola with
regard to the transit of Rwandan troops through the
territory of Angola.

I very much apologize for having once again
imposed on the members of the Council, but it was
necessary to shed some light on this matter.
