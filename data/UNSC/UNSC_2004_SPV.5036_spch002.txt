Mr. Danforth (United States of America): It is
the policy of the United States Government to ensure
that members of the armed services of the United
States of America participating in United Nations
peace operations are protected from criminal
prosecution or other assertion of jurisdiction by the
International Criminal Court. Normally, the United
States would seek express provisions providing such
protection for personnel from States not party to the
Rome Statute that contribute to any mission established
or authorized by the United Nations. In this instance,
the United States maintains sufficient bilateral
protections with the Government of Liberia to facilitate
continued United States participation in the United
Nations Mission in Liberia absent such express
provisions in the mandate extension.
