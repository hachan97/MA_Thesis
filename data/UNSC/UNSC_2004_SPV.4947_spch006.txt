Mr. Adechi (Benin) (spoke in French): Benin
voted in favour of the draft resolution in order to assure
the Cypriot parties that the United Nations is prepared
fully to assume its due responsibilities under the
settlement plan, should the parties adopt it. My
delegation is prepared to participate in negotiations
with a view to the establishment in due course of a
United Nations operation in support of the relevant
provisions of the settlement plan.

Our vote was also intended to indicate our
support for the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General
to find a solution to a problem that is of concern to the
international community. We believe, however, that the
decision to be taken on the entry into force of the
settlement plan - and thus on the reunification of the
island - belongs solely to the Cypriot community. We
hope that it will affirm its views in full independence
and make the choice it feels to be the right one.
