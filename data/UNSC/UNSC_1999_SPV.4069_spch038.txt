Mr. Radisic (Bosnia and Herzegovina) (spoke in Serbian; interpretation provided by the delegation): If we
compare the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina today
with the one that prevailed four years ago, we can see
that a lot has been done. But with respect to what we
want, what the Dayton Peace Agreement realistically
offers us and what we can do to shape the destiny of
Bosnia and Herzegovina, we are now at the beginning of
a great endeavour with lofty but realistic goals. We are
deeply aware of the challenges and difficulties facing not
only the Members of the Presidency but also all of the
other structures in Bosnia and Herzegovina, at all levels.

Your support means a lot to us, and I am convinced
that the first report prepared by the joint commission of
the entities and international representatives, as provided
for in the New York Declaration, will show clearly the
progress that has been made in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
