Mr. Meek (United Kingdom): In response to the
point made by our Russian colleague, the focus on
Ukraine reflected the serious nature of the situation
on the ground there, precipitated by Russia's actions
and support for the separatists involved in the conflict.
Our calls throughout have been clear. We have called
on all sides to observe the ceasefire and implement in
full the arrangement set out in the Minsk agreements
of September last year and 12 February just past.
Where we see flagrant and one-sided breaches of those
arrangments, we are duty-bound to draw them to the
attention of our colleagues on the Council at briefings
such as these.

As my Permanent Representative said, only
40 minutes after the ceasefire came into effect
separatists backed by Russia launched a final, all-out
assault to secure the town of Debaltseve, something
they had clearly been aiming for in the days just before
the ceasefire came into effect.

The provisions that will facilitate a resolution of
the conflict in eastern Ukraine are clearly laid out in
the Minsk agreements. We call again on all parties,
including Russia, to play their part in implementing
those agreements fully, verifiably and transparently,
and in supporting efforts to de-escalate tensions and
bring the violence to an end.
