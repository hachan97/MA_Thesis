Mr. Bourisly (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): Kuwait
voted in favour of resolution 2494 (2019), which
extends the mandate of the United Nations Mission for
the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) until
31 October 2020, because we believe in the Mission's
positive role. We would like to have seen it adopted
unanimously. However, we thank the delegation of the
United States, as the penholder, for its work and are
pleased that the Mission's mandate has been extended
for a year, something that we have repeatedly called for.
Now the new mandate has enough time to enable progress
to be made on the political process. The State of Kuwait
supports the relevant Security Council resolutions and
the efforts of the Secretary-General with a view to
reaching a solution that is acceptable to all parties. We
also stress the importance of MINURSO's role and of
ensuring that it can fully implement its mandate.

We want to express our thanks and appreciation
to Mr. Horst Kohler, the previous Personal Envoy of
the Secretary-General, for his good offices, which
have helped to move the political process forward
and to create momentum that has given us renewed
hope that a realistic and practical political solution
based on consensus can be achieved. We hope that his
successor will follow the same path. We look forward
to a resumption of the round-table meetings with the
participation of all parties, without preconditions and in
good faith, while ensuring that the frequency of meetings
is maintained and that trust and a convergence of views
are promoted. We emphasize that Kuwait is eager to
see enhanced security, stability and prosperity in the
Arab Maghreb. We want to reiterate Kuwait's position
in support of the Moroccan initiative for autonomy for
Western Sahara, which represents a constructive choice
aimed at reaching a solution acceptable to all parties,
and we once again affirm the importance of respecting
Morocco's sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity.
