Mr. Bamba (Cote d'lvoire) (spoke in French): It a
pleasure to see you, Mr. President, again presiding over
this meeting.
My delegation takes note of the adoption of
resolution 2101 (2013) pursuant to which the Security
Council renews the sanctions measures regarding C6te
d'Ivoire for the period of a year until 30 April 2014. It
also extends the mandate of the Group of Experts tasked
with reviewing the implementation of the sanctions
regime on Cote d'Ivoire until 30 April 2014.

I would like to point out that the resolution comes
at a time marked by considerable progress achieved by
Government of Cote d'Ivoire at all levels, in particular
with regard to stabilization, the security situation,
political dialogue, national reconciliation and economic
recovery. That undeniable situation, which was
affirmed by the recent technical assessment mission
that visited C6te d'Ivoire, is, fortunately, mentioned in
the resolution that has just been adopted.

As resolution 2101 (2013) underscores, my
delegation agrees that there are still significant that
require that the efforts under way be continued. In that
connection, my delegation would like to reaffirm the
complete readiness of the Government of Cote d'Ivoire
to fully cooperate with the United Nations, including
the Group of Experts of the Sanctions Committee, to
implement the measures contained in this resolution, as
well as in previous relevant resolutions.

In conclusion, my delegation hopes that, as
mentioned in the resolution, the contribution of such
measures to strengthening stability in cote d'Ivoire
will make it possible to envisage in the near future a
possible additional modification or a partial or compete
lifting of the sanctions regime on Cote d'Ivoire.
