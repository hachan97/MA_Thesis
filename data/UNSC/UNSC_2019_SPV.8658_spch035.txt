Mr. Heusgen (Germany): I do not want to prolong
the meeting - but briefly. During my intervention, I
took up what the High Representative had said earlier
with regard to the atmosphere in the region concerning
the denial of genocide and the glorification of war
criminals. I also asked how much the neighbours could
really contribute to the fight against genocide denial
and the glorification of war criminals. I did not hear
any anything about that in their responses. My question
to the representatives of Serbia and Croatia concerns
what they think can be done from their perspective. Can
they make a contribution to the points that I mentioned?
I would also like to say, concerning the representative
of Serbia, that the Serbian President, Mr. Vucie, made
the gesture of going to Srebrenica. With the influence
that he has, would he be ready to publicly ask for the
Karadzie dormitory in Pale to be renamed, for instance?
