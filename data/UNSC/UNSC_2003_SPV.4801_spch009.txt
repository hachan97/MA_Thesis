Mr. Mufioz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): We have
this morning adopted a resolution on the question of
Western Sahara based on consensus - rather than
imposition - regarding what we hope will be a real
path towards a definitive resolution of the conflict in
Western Sahara. We now have a clear and pragmatic
resolution that leaves enough political room to reach a
definitive solution on the basis of the Baker plan and
the agreement of the parties. We are pleased with that
important step, which does the Security Council credit.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank
the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy. We hope
that the parties will now do their part. In the end, it is
the parties themselves who hold in their hands a chance
to reach a definitive solution that brings about peace
and stability and that responds to the aspirations of the
peoples.
