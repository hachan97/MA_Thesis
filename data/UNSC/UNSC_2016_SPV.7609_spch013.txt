Mr. Mahmoud (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I
would like to congratulate you, Sir, and to thank
you and your delegation for your efforts this month,
culminating in the adoption of the historic resolution
2261 (2016), which will consolidate peace in Colombia
on a solid foundation and with the strong support of
the international community. In that respect, I welcome
Ms. Maria Angela Holguin Cuellar and to thank her
both for attending this historic meeting and for the
important steps being taken by Colombia.

On behalf of the Egyptian Government, I
congratulate the Government and the people of
Colombia on taking this historic step to put an end
to years of tension between the Government and the
Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, which
has claimed thousands of victims. We hope that a final
agreement will be reached in March, and wish Colombia
every success in that regard.

Like all other members of the Security Council,
Egypt sponsored and favour voted in of resolution
2261 (2016). We are convinced of the importance of
the political mission to be established pursuant to the
resolution, which would be in charge of observing the
implementation of the Final Agreement.

In conclusion, I would like to express my thanks
and appreciation to all those who mediated and thanks
to whom we have reached this historic moment, in
particular Cuba, Norway, Chile, Venezuela and all
other stakeholders. We also like thank the delegation of
the United Kingdom for all its efforts to facilitate this
important resolution.
