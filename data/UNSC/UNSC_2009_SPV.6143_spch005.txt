Mr. La Yifan (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
Security Council was unable to adopt a draft resolution
on a technical rollover of the United Nations Observer
Mission in Georgia, to the deep regret of the Chinese
delegation. In fact, the Council was only six hours
09-37028
away from the deadline. We should have made further
efforts. This is not the result we had hoped for.

Over the past two weeks, the Group of Friends
undertook painstaking consultations on the extension
of the United Nations mission and achieved some
degree of agreement. The Chinese delegation
consistently expected the Group of Friends to reach an
agreement to avoid a forced vote. However and
unfortunately, the consultations were locked in an
impasse. We were unable to reach a consensus on a
technical rollover.

Under those circumstances, the Chinese
delegation abstained in the voting on the draft
resolution. We urge the Group of Friends to assess the
situation, show maximum flexibility and a constructive
attitude, and conduct further consultations in order to
arrive at a compromise plan as soon as possible.

China has always maintained that all States
should abide by the United Nations Charter and the
norms of international law. Our position on the
principle of national sovereignty and territorial
integrity has been consistent and clear. We have always
maintained that safeguarding peace and stability in the
South Caucasus and beyond is in the interests of all
sides. We hope that the parties concerned will remain
calm, engage in dialogue in good faith, adhere to
peaceful means to solve their disputes and make joint
efforts to advance the well-being of the countries and
peoples of the region.
