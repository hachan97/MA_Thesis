Mr. Henze (Germany): Allow me first to
congratulate you, Sir, on your reassumption of the
presidency of the Security Council. I am sure that the
work of the Council will greatly benefit from your
experience.

Germany fully subscribes to the statement made by
the Presidency of the European Union. My Government
welcomes the reactivation of the International
Commission of Inquiry on illegal arms flows to Rwanda.
We support its work as a means to curb the continuing
violence in Rwanda, which is seriously affecting the
stability of this country and of the Great Lakes region as
a whole.

The illegal flow of small arms and light weapons is
a serious obstacle to the lasting resolution of conflicts.
The topic is of particular concern to my Government. We
have been active in the General Assembly in addressing

 

this difficult issue, especially in the context of the General
Assembly resolution "Consolidation of peace through
practical disarmament measures", initiated by Germany.

Germany was actively involved in the work of the
Commission of Inquiry in the past. A German expert was
a member of the Commission from October 1995 to April
1996.

It gives me great pleasure to announce that my
Government has decided to continue to support the
Commission by granting $50,000 for the continuation of its
work.
