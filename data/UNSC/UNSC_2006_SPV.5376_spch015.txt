Mr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): I wish
at the outset to thank Mr. Mark Malloch Brown for his
briefing.

Undoubtedly, the continued increase in the size
and complexity of peacekeeping operations leads to an
increase in their costs. That requires effective,
transparent and practical controls. Specific mandates
and proper planning are needed for peacekeeping
operations, to prepare for rapid deployment and to
ensure the accountability of all those who should bear
responsibility, particularly in the area of procurement.

The State of Qatar is deeply concerned with the
allegations of mismanagement and fraud in the
Secretariat. It believes that the practices of the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations should be
reviewed in order to determine whether there have
been cases of fraud or mismanagement in peacekeeping
operations, particularly in procurement. In spite of our
rejection of these dishonourable acts of impropriety,
we believe that those who will be held accountable will
receive due process. We look forward to the report to
be submitted to the General Assembly on this issue,
which we hope will include comprehensive proposals
to improve work in the field and to achieve greater
transparency. As for sexual exploitation, we fully agree
with Mr. Malloch Brown that there should be
absolutely no acceptance of such behaviour.
