Mr. Christian (Ghana): We, too, acknowledge
the presence of the Secretary-General and thank him
for his statement. We wish to thank all those who
worked hard for the adoption of resolution 1769

(2007), which paves the way for the implementation of
the African Union/United Nations hybrid operation in
Darfur. This is another step in the Council's efforts to
deal effectively with the conflict in Darfur. Our
ultimate goal should be to put an end to the suffering
afflicting the Victims of this conflict and to ensure that
peace prevails in Darfur.

With the adoption of this resolution, we are
confident that the international community will honour
its commitments towards the implementation of the
hybrid operation. We also call on the Government of
the Sudan and other parties to abide by the terms of the
resolution, in the interest of peace and security in
Darfur.

The adoption of this resolution is the culmination
of the tireless efforts of the African Union and the
United Nations to cooperate in resolving the conflict in
Darfur, and the momentum generated must not be lost
in bringing peace to Darfur. It is also incumbent on the
African Union and the United Nations to cooperate
further in the resolution of other conflicts on the
African continent.

To conclude, Ghana remains committed to the
promotion of peace and security on the African
continent and will therefore continue to play its part
toward the attainment of the objectives of resolution
1769 (2007).
