Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
At the outset, I should like to thank you, Mr. President,
for organizing today's public meeting. We are deeply
shocked by another Israeli assassination by means of
the targeted removal of a Hamas leader, Mr. Al-Rantisi,
in the Gaza Strip. We are deeply concerned about the
prospects of tension between Israel and Palestine,
which may worsen as a result. China strongly
condemns this violation of international law, and we
call upon Israel to immediately cease such
assassination operations.

China is always of the view that the Middle East
issue is complex. The only way to peace in the Middle
East lies in a comprehensive settlement, to be reached
through negotiations on the basis of Security Council
resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 1397 (2002) and
1515 (2003). Violence for violence will not help to
resolve the issue; on the contrary, it will only lead to
more violence and conflict. Under the current
circumstances, the international community should
intensify its efforts and promptly take practical,
effective measures to bring Israel and Palestine back to
the peace talks at an early date.
