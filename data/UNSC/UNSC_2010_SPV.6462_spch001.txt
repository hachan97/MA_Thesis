The President: Members of the Council have
before them document 8/2010/650, which contains the
text of a draft resolution submitted by Austria, Japan
and the United States of America.

I wish to draw the attention of members to
document 8/2010/607, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the United Nations Disengagement
Observer Force for the period from 1 July to
31 December 2010.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

A vote was taken by Show of hands.
2
In favour:
Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
France, Gabon, Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria,
Russian Federation, Turkey, Uganda, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America

The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1965 (2010).

In connection with the resolution just adopted on
the renewal of the mandate of the United Nations
Disengagement Observer Force, I have been authorized
to make the following complementary statement on
behalf of the Security Council:

"As is known, the report of the Secretary-
General on the United Nations Disengagement
Observer Force (S/2010/607) states in
paragraph 13 that "the situation in the Middle
East is tense and is likely to remain so, unless and
until a comprehensive settlement covering all
aspects of the Middle East problem can be
reached". That statement of the Secretary-General
reflects the View of the Security Council."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2010/30.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at I] am.
