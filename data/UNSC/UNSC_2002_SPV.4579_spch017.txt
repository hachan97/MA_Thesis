The President: Delegations might just like to
have an idea of my intentions on timing. I will get
through as many speeches as possible over the next 40
minutes or so. I will then give Ambassador Brahimi, if
he agrees, the last 10 minutes or so of the morning. We
will then close by 1.15 pm. I intend to resume this
debate at 3 pm.
