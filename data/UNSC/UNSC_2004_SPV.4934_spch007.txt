Mr. Motoc (Romania) (spoke in French):
Romania abstained in the voting on the draft resolution
under consideration. Unlike the texts, submitted in the
past in other multilateral forums, that Romania was
able to support, the draft before us does not ensure that
the general context in which the death of Sheikh Yassin
took place is taken into account in a similar manner.
Nevertheless, we appreciated the efforts of the text's
negotiators to reconcile the different points of View
expressed.

Aside from the document's procedural
difficulties, it should have been very clear on substance
and should have taken into account my delegation's
position on the problem just considered by the Council.
Indeed, Romania believes that extrajudicial killings are
unacceptable and contrary to international law.
Romania emphasizes once again that any terrorist act is
unacceptable and must be condemned.
The implementation of the road map must resume
without further delay. That settlement plan has been
accepted by the parties. It is the only one that provides

an appropriate framework to achieve - through
negotiation and with the support of the international
community, represented by the Quartet - a just and

lasting solution based on the relevant Security Council
resolutions and on the vision of two States living
together in peace and security within safe and
internationally recognized borders.
