Mr. Okamura (Japan): Japan welcomes the
unanimous adoption of resolution 2288 (2016). We
would like to express our appreciation to the Permanent
Mission of the United States for leading the process
towards its adoption. I would also like to thank the
Permanent Representative of Ukraine, Chair of the
sanctions committee, and the Panel of Experts for their
dedicated work.

After a 13-year sanctions regime, Liberia has
overcome not only the threat of conflict but also the
Ebola crisis that disrupted the country's peacebuilding
process and took a devastating toll on the people of
Liberia. Japan commends Liberia for its endurance in
the face of such difficult challenges.

The issue that remains for Liberia is to build
resilient national institutions from which all
Liberians - young and old, men and women - can
benefit. As yet, certain important security laws, such as
the firearms and ammunition control act, have not been
enacted. We certainly hope that they will be enacted
expeditiously as the first step on the longer journey
of institution-building. Such legislation will help to
strengthen the capacities of the security sector and
build trust between the people and the authorities.

Japan is confident that Liberia's leadership will
accelerate the necessary legislative processes with
both determination and ownership. We trust that, with
the support of the international community, including
through the Peacebuilding Commission, Liberia will
serve as a model for overcoming fragility and building
sound and resilient institutions.
