Mr. Danon (Israel): All of us, or maybe all of us,
around this table know what it takes to be a leader.
Leaders assume responsibility. Leaders speak out.
Leaders educate. For the sake of the next generation,
this is the lesson the Palestinians must learn. On the
day Palestinian leaders, like Mr. Mansour, publicly
condemn terror against Israelis i publicly - on the
day they end their campaign of hate and violence, on the
day respect for all - all - human beings is taught in
Palestinian schools, on that day they will find a partner
ready to work with them for the promise of peace. The
State of Israel and the people of Israel continue to hope
that that day will come soon.
