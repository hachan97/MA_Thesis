Mr. Gimolieca (Angola): We thank Ambassador
Roman Oyarzun Marchesi for his presentation of the
90-day report of the Committee established pursuant
to resolution 1737 (2006). We commend his excellent
work as Chair of the Committee.

We are pleased that on 18 October - adoption
day of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
(JCPOA) - the participants began the necessary
arrangements, including legal and administrative
provisions for the implementation of their commitments
under the JCPOA. This is a positive step that we hope
will lead to a long-lasting solution to the Iranian nuclear
issue.

It is crucial that during the transitional period,
the Government of Iran seek to implement all specific
actions stipulated in resolution 2231 (2015), by which the
Security Council endorsed the JCPOA, so as to expedite
the easing of the sanctions against Iran by reaching
implementation day, putting an end to all sanctions
imposed on Iran. In that regard, we strongly encourage
the Government of Iran to remain fully committed to
the measures imposed by relevant Security Council
resolutions until implementation day, and avoid such
actions as the alleged launch of Emad ballistic missiles

reported to the Committee on 21 October.

On the other hand, we welcome the report of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), ending
the 12-year investigation into allegations that Iran was
developing a nuclear weapons programme, thereby
closing the issue ofa possible military dimension ofthe
Iran nuclear programme, which is a key Step towards
the lifting of international sanctions.

In conclusion, we would like to express our
recognition of Iran's right to pursue a nuclear programme
exclusively for peaceful purposes, and encourage the
Government to continue its cooperation with the IAEA
in implementing the related measures stipulated in the
JCPOA and in accordance with resolution 2231 (2015).
