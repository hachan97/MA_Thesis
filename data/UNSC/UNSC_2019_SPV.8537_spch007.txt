Mr. Matjila (South Africa): I want to apologize
because I forgot to congratulate you, Mr. President, on
what a marvellous job you have done, including filling
my wardrobe with extra batik shirts. Sir, you and your
team, as my colleagues from the United Kingdom and
Equatorial Guinea were saying, have done an excellent
job. I know we have all put pressure on you, and pulled
you this way and that, and that is how the Council
works. Anyway, I offer you congratulations on a job
well done - in an Asian way, with Asian flavour
and style.

Kuwait is not very far from Asia. I am sure its
delegation has been watching you carefully, Sir, to see
how Asians manage the files.

My brother, I offer you my congratulations. I was
reminded by my colleagues from several delegations
that I had made a terrible mistake and had better
apologize now. So, again, I offer my congratulations
and thanks.
