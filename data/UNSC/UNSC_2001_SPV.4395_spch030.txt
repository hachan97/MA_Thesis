The President: I thank the representative of
Zimbabwe for his kind words addressed to me.

The hour is late. We have had a very full
discussion. I would hope not to have to resume the
meeting this afternoon. I therefore make an appeal for
brevity to the remaining speakers.

I give the floor to Minister She Okitundu.
