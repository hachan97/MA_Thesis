Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): Resolution 2510 (2020), which we just adopted, is viable. We all want to see it implemented. I must say, it is the first time that I have heard a period of three weeks after a conference described as a rush. Some of us might think it is a bit leisurely given the situation on the ground. However, the important thing is that the resolution gives concrete expression to the commitments that leaders, including President Putin, adopted at Berlin, so that the international community and the United Nations can take action to uphold the arms embargo, assist the parties in arriving at a ceasefire, make preparations to look at options for monitoring it before it is agreed and monitor that ceasefire once agreed. The most important thing, though, is that the players are now in no doubt as to the strong will of the Security Council. We want to see a ceasefire, we want to see the arms embargo upheld and we want to help the United Nations assist the parties in arriving at a Libyan-owned and Libyan- led solution. The United Nations might be front and centre of the international community's efforts, but it is able to call on the support of the African Union, the League of Arab States and the European Union. On a general point, I want to stress again that the Security Council does not act only when parties ask it to act. The whole point of having the Security Council is that it can step into a situation and make its own decisions. That is why it is a sovereign Council. Furthermore, consensus should never mean, and has never meant, the lowest common denominator.
