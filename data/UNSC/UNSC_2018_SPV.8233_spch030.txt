Mrs. Gregoire Van Haaren (Netherlands):
The Kingdom of the Netherlands voted against the
draft resolution proposed by the Russian Federation
(S/2018/355) because the text does not provide for
the urgent action that the Security Council must take
in response to the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
It ignores the very essence of the action that must be
taken by the Council. It should condemn the use of
chemical weapons in Syria, protect its people and hold
accountable those responsible. Today's draft resolution
does none of the above.
