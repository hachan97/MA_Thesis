Mr. Masood Khan (Pakistan): We thank the
United Kingdom for preparing resolution 2114 (2013)
on the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus
(UNFICYP) and for steering its delicate negotiating
process.

Pakistan welcomes the first interaction between the
leaders of the two sides in Cyprus in May this year and
the prospects of the commencement of the negotiating
process later this year. Pakistan supports Cyprus-led
and Cyprus-owned negotiations. We hope that both
parties will direct their efforts towards 3 results-
oriented process leading to a durable settlement. We
support the efforts of the Security Council and the good
offices mission.

As for the resolution just adopted, we had made
a number of suggestions to ensure a fair balance in
the draft. Some suggestions were taken on board, and
we deeply appreciate that. However, a reference to
joint statements, including those of 23 May and July
2008, was deleted. That constrained us to abstain in
the voting on the draft resolution. Our abstention is
without prejudice to our support for the extension of
UNFICYP's mandate and the early commencement of
negotiations.

We support the essential objectives of the resolution.
