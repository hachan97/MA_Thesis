Mr. Wolff (United States of America): I am not in
the habit of taking the floor twice in public meetings
like this, but since some direct questions were posed to
me, I do not want to leave the room with people
wondering what my response might be.

The reference to folly was very clear and it did
not refer to the intention to send humanitarian
assistance, which my Government participates in. My
Government provides humanitarian assistance. I do not
have the exact statistics, but it is my understanding that
this is the first time since 2006 that the Government of
Libya has tried to provide assistance to the Palestinian
people. I may be wrong, but that is the information that
I have, and it raises a question about what the real
motives are.

The reference to folly relates to the point I made
at the beginning, which is that if the intent is to provide
humanitarian assistance, which we support, it is hard to
imagine an approach better designed to fail in that
effort than the one undertaken in this incident. As we
know, these are countries that do not have diplomatic
relations with each other. There is hostility between
them. It would be unreasonable to expect that an
uncoordinated yet premeditated effort to deliver
assistance into areas patrolled in the waters off Gaza,
under agreement with the Palestinian Authority, would
be allowed to go unchallenged in this day and age.
Again, the point I made is that it is remarkable that this
did not escalate, and we should all be grateful for that.
Therein lies the folly - not in the act of trying to
provide humanitarian assistance.
