The Secretary-General: I am pleased to take
part in this important meeting of the Security Council
this morning on the situation concerning Iraq. I
welcome the Council's decision today to renew and
strengthen the mandate of the United Nations
Assistance Mission for Iraq through the unanimous
adoption of resolution 1770 (2007).

The United Nations is deeply committed to
helping the people of Iraq, and I am pleased to have the
opportunity now to enhance, where possible, our
contributions in crucial areas such as national
reconciliation, regional dialogue, humanitarian
assistance and human rights.
A peaceful and prosperous future is for Iraqis
themselves to create, with the international community
lending support to their efforts.

The United Nations looks forward to working in
close partnership with the leaders and people of Iraq to
explore how we can further our assistance under the
terms of this resolution. I take this opportunity to
express my profound appreciation and respect to the
people and Government of Iraq for their courageous
efforts to make their country more stable, democratic
and prosperous.

As we remember our colleagues who died in
Baghdad four years ago, I also take this opportunity to
pay tribute to the brave men and women who continue
to serve the United Nations in Iraq. As we move
forward, their safety and security will remain a
paramount concern.
