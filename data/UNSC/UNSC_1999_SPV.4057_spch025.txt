Mr. Fonseca (Brazil): Today the Security Council
has taken another decisive step in the long and painful
process leading to the self-determination of East Timor.
The Brazilian people have always fully supported the goal
of an independent East Timor, so for us today is a day of
joy and hope.

Brazil is one of the sponsors of the draft resolution
on which we are about to vote. We believe it adequately
reflects the recommendations made by the
Secretary-General with regard to the United Nations
Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET).

We would like to highlight operative paragraph 8 of
the draft resolution, which stresses the need for UNTAET
to consult and cooperate closely with the East Timorese
people. The construction of a new nation is necessarily an
endeavour of all the people. In the case of East Timor,
the process of healing and reconciliation is a necessary
condition for a smooth transition to independence. In that
regard, Brazil thinks regards the role of the National
Council of Timorese Resistance as being of the utmost
importance.

This is the last formal step before the United Nations
fully assumes its responsibilities with regard to East
T imor. Less than a week ago, the Indonesian People's
Consultative Assembly unanimously voted for the
annulment of the measure that had annexed the Territory
of East Timor. We congratulate the Indonesian
Government for that timely decision.

It is not necessary to mention individually all those
who have contributed to the goal of self-determination for
East Timor. My delegation would like to pay tribute to
the courage of the East Timorese people in maintaining
this ideal during difficulties that at times seemed
insurmountable.

Now, it is up to the international community,
through the United Nations, to ensure that the future State

 

of East Timor is built on a solid and lasting democratic
foundation. Brazil is ready to contribute to this endeavour.
