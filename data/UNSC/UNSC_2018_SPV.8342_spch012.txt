Mr. Zhang Dianbin (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China thanks you, Mr. President, for convening today's
meeting. China also thanks Assistant Secretary-
General Keita for her briefing.

China has taken note of the recent violent events
in parts of Haiti, which reflect the existing fragile
security situation to a large degree and the need for
political stability and economic development to be
further consolidated. China hopes that the parties in
Haiti will promptly resolve their differences through
inclusive political dialogue and consultations. The
Haitian Government should continue to increase its
efforts to develop the economy, improve people's
livelihoods and fully implement the Haitian National
Police strategic plan to create favourable conditions
for the thorough improvement of the situation in the
country. The international community and countries of
the region should also pay more attention to the issue
of Haiti and support its consolidation of peace and
stability and its efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development.

China appreciates the recent work of the
United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti
(MINUJUSTH) and Deputy Special Representative
Diallo. We welcome the appointment by Secretary-
General Guterres ost. Meagher La Lime as the Special
Representative for Haiti and Head of the Mission. We
hope that Ms. Meagher La Lime will start to work as
soon as possible after taking over to help the Haitian
Government strengthen its police force and take up
in earnest the responsibility of maintaining national
security and stability. China is willing to work with
other members of the Security Council to contribute to
the early achievement of lasting peace and sustainable
development in Haiti.
