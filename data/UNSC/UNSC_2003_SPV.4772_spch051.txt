Mr. Cheng Jingye (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
too would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on
the occasion of your national day.

China supports the establishment of an
independent, impartial, effective and universal
International Criminal Court (ICC). The Chinese
Government actively participated in the whole process
leading to the establishment of the ICC. We will now
follow closely its operations. We hope that the ICC,
through its performance, will contribute to the
universality of the Rome Statute.

My delegation views today's debate as very
useful. We understand the concerns registered by many
countries at today's meeting. We attach importance to
the views expressed by the Secretary-General. We hope
that in the year following the renewal of resolution
1422 (2002) the parties concerned will carefully study
the relevant questions with a view to finding proper
solutions.
