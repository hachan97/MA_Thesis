Sir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): We,
too, warmly welcome Minister Kerim's presence. I
think that he is finding that the Council is pretty
unanimous in what it is saying to him in support of the
proposals he has put forward and on the situation his
country finds itself in. We certainly condemn the recent
violence that ethnic Albanian extremists have
perpetrated in northern Macedonia, including the tragic
killing of the three soldiers at the weekend.

We very much welcome the dialogue that has now
sprung up between the Macedonian Government and
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the
Kosovo Force (KFOR) on practical steps to address the
immediate situation and to provide a basis for
intensified, longer-term cooperation. I entirely echo the
commendation of my colleagues around this table for
the prudent action taken so far by the Macedonian
Government. The Foreign Minister's visit to NATO on
Friday will be an important occasion for
operationalizing the proposals for action that he has
presented today. Resolution 1244 (1999) gives KFOR a
broad mandate to act and the operational decisions are
for it to make. We welcome the measures that have
already been agreed - for instance, tougher KFOR
control of the boundary and closer liaison between
KFOR and the Macedonian armed forces. These should
soon translate into more effective combined response
on the ground.

We in the Council will continue to monitor the
situation closely from here, in parallel with the
operational action taken by our colleagues in the North
Atlantic Council. There is strong United Kingdom
support for the presidential statement that we are
adopting today, which should send a clear message to
the extremists that the violence will not be tolerated.
