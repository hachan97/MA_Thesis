The President: I thank Major General Iqbal Asi for
his briefing.

I should like to remind colleagues that this is an
informal meeting, and its main value is the interactive
questions and answers with the Force Commanders.
So I would encourage Council members to keep their
statements brief and to focus on questions for the three
Force Commanders and Mr. Ladsous so that there will
be time for them to respond to those at the end of the
meeting.
I also remind colleagues of the three topics under
discussion: the use of more technologically advanced
military capabilities to fulfil mandates, in-mission
assessments of pre-deployment training, and
inter-mission cooperation.

I shall now give the floor to members of the
Security Council.
