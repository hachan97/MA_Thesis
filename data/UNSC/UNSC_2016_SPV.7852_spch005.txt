Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I understand that this is the final statement
of my colleague from New Zealand in the Security
Council, and I do not want to spoil his swan song.
However just for protocol, just for the record, we do
not agree with a number of the arguments he put forth.
What is particularly unacceptable is the conflation he
made between the veto and his comment that someone
is pursuing military goals without thinking about
humanitarian consequences. If he is hinting at Russia,
that is not the case.

We have just heard about a very complex operation
in Aleppo to evacuate civilians, so I want to assure
the representative of New Zealand that humanitarian
consequences are of extreme concern to us when it
comes to any planning in Syria.

Another even more important problem that the
representative of New Zealand did not mention is the
fact that terror organizations are used to achieve foreign
policy objectives. That is the real problem that, again
and again, the Security Council needs to be address.
