The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now
briefly speak in my capacity as representative of Spain.

I wish to thank Mr. Guehenno and Mr.
Ramcharan for their statements. I also wish to express
revulsion at the acts that have occurred and to ask a
question with respect to the national human rights
institutions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
in particular the National Observatory for Human
Rights and the National Truth and Reconciliation
Commission.

How will those two institutions cooperate with
the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the
United Nations Organization Mission in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo? What are the
financing prospects for these national institutions?

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.
I call on the representative of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.
