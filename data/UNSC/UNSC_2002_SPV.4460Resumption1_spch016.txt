Mr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): I should
like, on behalf of the European Union, to commend
you, Mr. President, for your timely initiative in
organizing this meeting at such a historic moment, as
we witness the transformation of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) into the African Union and the
establishment of a new plan for the recovery of Africa.
I also want to welcome His Excellency Mr. Amara
Essy, the Secretary General of the OAU, and to thank
him for his statement. His statement to the Council
represents a further step towards strengthening
cooperation between the OAU and the United Nations.

Africa is a priority for the European Union. Proof
of this, and evidence of the extreme importance of this
meeting, is the presence here today of His Excellency
Mr. Javier Solana, the High Representative of the
European Union for the European Union Common
Foreign and Security Policy, to whom I have the
honour to yield the floor.
