Mr. Terzic (Bosnia and Herzegovina) (spoke in Bosnian; interpretation provided by the delegation):
Thank you, Mr. President, for giving me the floor
again.

The Permanent Representative of the United
Kingdom asked about the international community's
exit strategy in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As far as we
are concerned, the exit strategy is clear. First, a time
frame and deadlines have been provided for Bosnia and
Herzegovina's membership in the European Union and
NATO. It is to join the European Union by 2009. We
would like the Council to support us and give us
encouragement in that endeavour.

Secondly, I would like the Council to start
promoting Bosnia and Herzegovina as a success story
of the international community because that is really
what it is.

Thirdly, the Council should support the High
Representative in his intention to transfer his
competencies to local governments in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.

Fourthly, the Council should support my
Government in structural and economic reforms and in
the fight against organized crime.

Together, let us create in Bosnia and Herzegovina
a positive environment for the implementation of those
measures. The High Representative and I wish to
dramatically change the role of the Office of the High
Representative in decision-making in Bosnia and
Herzegovina through the elections in 2006. I would
like the Council to support us in that.

Very briefly, with respect to the de-certification
of police officers, it is truly a priority to uphold the
legal instruments of the United Nations. Bosnia and
Herzegovina accepts its international obligations. Yet,
like any other country, it is committed to international
legal instruments, including the European Convention
on Human Rights, which forms part of our
Constitution. Therefore, the issue is rather complex.
For our part, we will try to meet our obligations
towards international law. At the same time, we hope to
maintain a procedure that addresses all aspects.
