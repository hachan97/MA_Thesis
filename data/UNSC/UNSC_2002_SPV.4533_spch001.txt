discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
accordance with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the discussion without the right to vote,
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the

of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation ofthe President, Mr. S'ahovic'

under rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure to

for Peacekeeping Operations.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Gue'henno to take a seat at the
Council table.

meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.
