Mr. Pleuger (Germany): Like other delegations,
mine would like to welcome you, Sir, in the presidency
of the Security Council and to assure you of its support
this month.

I would also like to thank Ambassador Jones
Parry for the very effective and elegant way in which
he did his job as President of the Council last month.

As the German Chancellor said after a meeting
with President Mubarak, the action against Syria is not
acceptable. The German Government feels that a
violation of the sovereignty of a neighbouring State
does not facilitate peace and stability in the region and
that such action makes the Middle East conflict even
more complicated. We, like other delegations, also
condemn the suicide bombing that occurred in Haifa
and that killed 19 people and injured many more. Our
condolences go to the bereaved families of the victims.
These acts of terrorism have to be stopped and whoever
can exercise influence to that effect should do so.

We are very concerned about the deteriorating
situation in the Middle East. We feel that we have to
break the vicious circle of violence and counter-
violence. De-escalation, we feel, is possible only by a
return to implementing the road map as proposed by
the Quartet. There is no alternative to the road map for
finding a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
and for creating peace and stability in the Middle East.
