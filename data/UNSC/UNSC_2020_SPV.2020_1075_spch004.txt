Estonia welcomes the adoption of resolution 2548 (2020), renewing the mandate of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) for another year. We would like to take this opportunity to reiterate Estonia's full support to MINURSO and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General. Estonia supports the efforts of the Secretary-General to find a just, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution to the Western Sahara conflict, based on the relevant Security Council resolutions. It is important not to lose the political momentum that was achieved in the round table meetings in 2018 and 2019. In this connection, we hope that a new personal envoy of the Secretary-General will be appointed as soon as possible and that further talks between the parties can be pursued in a spirit of compromise. Moreover, in the light of the latest report by the Secretary-General (S/2020/938), it is important to stress and call for the parties to continue their cooperation with Special Representative of the Secretary-General Stewart and MINURSO.
