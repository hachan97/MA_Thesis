Mr. Chen Xu (China) (spoke in Chinese): First of
all, we would like to thank Under-Secretary-General
Guehenno for his very extensive briefing.

We welcome the successful holding of elections
in Bosnia and Herzegovina and appreciate the large
amount of work done by the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the parties
concerned, with joint efforts by the three sides in
Bosnia. They were the third elections since the signing
ofthe Dayton Peace Agreements, and they represent an
important step in the peace process in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. We hope that the elections will help the
early realization of self-reliance and self-sustainability
in Bosnia and Herzegovina, so as to enhance peace and
stability in the Balkan region.

Only through tolerance and reconciliation among
the Muslims, Croats and Serbs, and the restoration of
confidence and joint development efforts, will good-
neighbourly relations and peace be guaranteed for the
Bosnian people. We sincerely hope that the leaders of
the three groups will proceed on the basis of the
fundamental interests of their people and safeguard the
hard-won peace, leading to the achievement of
economic independence and prosperity at an early date.
