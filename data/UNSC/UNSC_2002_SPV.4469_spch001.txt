The President (spoke in Spanish): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, Special
Representative of the Secretary-General for
Afghanistan.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Brahimi to take a seat at the Council
table.

I welcome the presence of the Secretary-General
and invite him to take the floor.
