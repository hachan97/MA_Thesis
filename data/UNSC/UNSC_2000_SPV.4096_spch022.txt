The President: I know that President Chiluba is going
to have to leave shortly, so I will ask him if he would like
to make any observations on what he has heard so far, just
informally, to give us a sense of how he feels things are
going and where he would hope that we could assist him
beyond his important speech, based on what he has heard,
in taking the Lusaka peace process forward.
