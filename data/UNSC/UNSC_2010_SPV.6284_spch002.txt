Mr. Choi Young-Jin: The political impasse that
started in early January this year in the wake of the
production of the second electoral list by the former
Independent Electoral Commission Chairman,
Mr. Mambe', resulted in a serious weakening of the
electoral momentum.

It is quite regrettable to see the elections delayed
once again. Our disappointment is all the more acute as
2

the elections, which had been in preparation for so
long, appeared to be within our grasp when the
provisional electoral list, which was highly credible
and well-balanced, was established in November.

With the formation of the new Government and
the new Electoral Commission in March, two issues are
likely to dominate Ivorian politics for the immediate
future: elections and reunification within the
framework of the Ouagadougou Political Agreement.

As illustrated by the recent violence in various
parts of the country, which has resulted in 12 deaths
and a score of seriously injured persons, the current
election-reunification dynamics may cause additional
violent demonstrations and casualties.

Under the circumstances, the United Nations
Operation in Cote d'Ivoire (UNOCI) has set three
objectives for the immediate future: first, maintaining
peace and stability; secondly, safeguarding past
achievements, including the provisional electoral list;
and thirdly, establishing the definitive electoral list as
expeditiously as possible.

With UNOCI staff and the international
community in Abidjan, I shall continue working with
the Ouagadougou Political Agreement protagonists
with a view to producing the definitive electoral list as
soon as possible and developing a clearer picture of the
unfolding election-reunification dynamics. This
approach would permit us to report on possible options
for UNOCI and to prepare detailed plans in time for
the Security Council's next consultations on Cote
d'Ivoire.
