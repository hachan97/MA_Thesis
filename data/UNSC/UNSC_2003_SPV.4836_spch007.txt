Mr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): Today's
meeting is taking place due to certain events of grave
concern to us. The situation in the Middle East during
recent weeks has obligated us to call for prudence and
restraint. Any act that will unleash a spiral of violence
must be rejected. In that context, we would like firmly
to condemn yesterday's attack in Haifa, which we
believe was completely odious and reprehensible,
regardless of the date on which it was committed.
However, that cannot cause us to overlook or minimize
the extreme gravity of the attack perpetrated against
Syria today. That attack is clearly a patent violation of
international law. Accordingly, it is something we
believe to be worthy of condemnation. I should also
like to appeal for moderation to be exercised in the
Middle East. The parties should also understand that
reprisals only lead to a dire aggravation of the
situation.
