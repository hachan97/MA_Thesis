The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Bahrain. Unless I hear any objection,
I invite the representative of Bahrain to participate in
this meeting.

I wish to remind all speakers to limit their
statements to no more than four minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Ecuador.
