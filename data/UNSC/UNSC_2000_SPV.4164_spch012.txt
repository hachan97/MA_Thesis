The President (spoke in French): If there is no
objection, the Permanent Representative of Portugal
and Mr. Solana will speak immediately after Mr. Bildt
and before the members ofthe Council.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The Security Council will now consider the item
on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
statement by Mr. Carl Bildt, Special Envoy of the
Secretary-General for the Balkans. I now call on Mr.
Bildt.
