The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the
Secretary-General for his statement.

I think I can say that the sustained applause he has
received is an indication of the degree of sympathy and
affection felt by the members of the Security Council
and the General Assembly, since it breaks with the
tradition of not applauding in the Chamber. I thank the
Secretary-General once again for his statement and his
continued collaboration.

The meeting rose at 11.20 a.m.
