Mr. Kulla (Albania): Allow me first to thank you,
Sir, for your competent guidance of the proceedings of
the Security Council during this month and to
congratulate your predecessor, His Excellency
Ambassador Park of the Republic of Korea, on his
presidency last month.

On behalf of the Albanian Government, I should like
to express my appreciation to the members of the Security
Council for their prompt and effective reaction to the
situation in Albania through resolution 1101 (1997) and
for the attention they have given to the periodic reports of
the Steering Committee. Our thanks go also to the
Secretary-General for his valuable contribution to this
issue.

At the same time, my Government and people are
grateful to the coalition of the willing for the creation of
the Multinational Protection Force headed by Italy. The
Multinational Protection Force, in cooperation with the
Albanian authorities, has been successful in improving the
situation in my country. The Albanian people are in the
process of taking important decisions for the stability and
the future of the country through parliamentary elections.

 

With this in mind, I invite the members of the Council
to vote in favour of the present draft resolution, which
would authorize the Multinational Protection Force to
further help in the normalization of the situation in Albania.
