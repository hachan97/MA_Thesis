The Secretary-General: I want to congratulate
the Security Council on having taken another important
step on the historic journey of nationhood for the
Republic of South Sudan. We are on the eve of
welcoming our 193rd Member State to the United
Nations.

Let me just say very quickly how proud I was to
attend the Independence Day celebration in Juba. It
was an exciting and deeply moving occasion. The
people of South Sudan endured a 21-year civil war.
The toll in lives lost and people displaced can be
counted in the millions. Now they have a country to
call their own, but in many ways the hard work has just
2

begun. Government institutions are weak. There are
tremendous challenges on every front: social services,
health and education. On the day of its birth, South
Sudan ranked at the bottom of almost all human
development indicators.

Like any newborn, South Sudan needs help. Our
responsibilities are enormous, and the role of the
United Nations is vital, but complicated. We have a
mission in Darfur. Our mission in the Sudan must now
be liquidated. Ethiopian peacekeepers have deployed in
Abyei. The situation in Southern Kordofan is deeply
troubling. Resolving these tensions is absolutely vital.
For a viable South, we need a viable North, and Vice
versa. Together, South and North must face their
common future as partners, not rivals. We must
continue to help the new nation to become a nation and
the region to consolidate its gains. This is the ultimate
test of peacebuilding and nation-building. The United
Nations must be at the centre, and the leadership and
direction of the Security Council will be crucial in the
months and years ahead. I thank the Council for its
commitment.
