The Secretary-General has asked many times for more humanitarian access in Syria, not less. He called for a renewal for 12 months of the two crossings in the north-west, Bab Al-Hawa and Bab Al-Salam, and for more cross-line and more cross-border access to the north-east. After nine years of war, hundreds of thousands of civilians in the north-west of Syria had no other choice than to flee the violence earlier this year, further to the north. The offensive caused a massive displacement of people into a shrinking territory. While the Bab Al-Hawa crossing is used to deliver aid to Idlib province, aid coming through the Bab Al-Salam crossing reaches the region north of Aleppo, currently home to over 800,000 internally displaced persons. The Russian proposal, however, aims to stop the mandate for the border- crossing of Bab Al-Salam, limiting humanitarian access to a single border crossing in the north, Bab Al-Hawa. Although the size and capacity of the border crossings are different, they are both equally essential to provide assistance to 2.8 million people in need in north-western Syria. Both areas are separated by conflict lines. Finally, the numbers of those in need did not decrease; on the contrary, demands for food, shelter and health care increased to record levels. Therefore, my country has voted against this text. The co-penholders will further engage in efforts with all parties to come to consensus. This is an important responsibility of the Council. We hope we can find unity, in the interests of the Syrian people in need.
