The President: I thank the Minister for Foreign
Affairs of Burkina Faso for his statement.

I shall now give the floor to those Council
members who wish to make comments or ask questions
in response to the briefings that we have just heard.

On behalf of the Council, I wish to extend a
warm welcome to the Secretary of State for
Cooperation and Francophony of France, Mr. Jean-
Marie Bockel.
