The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Myanmar and Singapore, in which
they request to be invited to participate in the
consideration of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the consideration without the right to
vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President,
Mr. Swe (Myanmar) and Mr. Menon (Singapore)
took the seats reserved for them at the side of the
Council Chamber

The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Ibrahim Gambari,
Special Envoy of the Secretary-General.

It is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in response to a request contained in a letter
dated 3 October 2007 from the Permanent
Representative of the United States of America to the
United Nations addressed to the President of the
Security Council, under the symbol S/2007/590.

I welcome the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban
Ki-moon, and invite him to take the floor.
