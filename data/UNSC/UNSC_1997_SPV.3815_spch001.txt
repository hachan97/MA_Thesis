The President: As this is the first meeting of the
Security Council for the month of September, I should like
to take this opportunity to pay tribute, on behalf of the
Council, to His Excellency Sir John Weston, Permanent
Representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland to the United Nations, for his service as
President of the Security Council for the month of August
1997. I am sure I speak for all members of the Council in
expressing deep appreciation to Ambassador Weston for the
great diplomatic skill with which he conducted the
Council's business last month.

Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.

Consideration of the draft report of the Security
Council to the General Assembly

The President: The Council will now proceed to the
consideration of its annual report to the General Assembly,
the draft of which has been prepared by the Secretariat.
Members of the Council have before them the draft report
of the Security Council to the General Assembly for the
period from 16 June 1996 to 15 June 1997, as circulated by
the Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs on 27
August 1997, and a corrigendum thereto.

I should like to express appreciation to the Secretariat
for the work it has undertaken in preparing this factual
report.

I now call on Assistant Secretary-General Fall to make
an explanatory statement.
