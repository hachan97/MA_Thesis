Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): 1 was not going to speak again either.
However, the response by the representative of the
United States, and by extension whatever constituency
he is representing, has forced me to take the floor again.

For the information of the members of the Security
Council, Russia, unlike the United States, has no
satellites. Venezuela is not a satellite of Russia, and
neither is Cuba. We do not even utilize that kind of
terminology. It does not exist in our foreign policy or
our diplomacy.

It may surprise the representative of the United
States to learn that, when we discuss certain issues at
the Security Council, we never try to force any country
to conduct itself as we would like it to or as would be in
our interest. We always respect the sovereignty of every
country, whether it is a member of the Security Council
or not, and we always respect its opinions and policies.
If its policies or views correspond with our own, we
are happy. If not, we respect that every United Nations
Member is entitled to its own views and positions and
has the sovereign right to have its own foreign policy.

Unfortunately, there are many instances of the
country that the representative of the United States
represents not only using its satellite States to promote
its own interests but in fact forcing them to be in
lockstep with it. To discuss who has and who does not
have satellites is therefore not something I suggest
he do.
