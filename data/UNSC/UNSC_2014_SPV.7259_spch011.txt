The President: I would like to thank Sandra for a
briefing that none of us will forget.

Before we proceed to statements, I would like to
point out that we intend to continue the practice started
last month during the United Kingdom presidency of
using the flashing light on the collar of the speaker's
microphone to signal when five minutes have elapsed.
I strongly encourage both members and non-members
of the Council to conclude their remarks as soon as
possible after that light starts flashing. We will carry
on this open debate right through lunch, as we have
a very large number of speakers, again testifying to
the interest and concern of all States Members of the
United Nations.

I shall now give the floor to the members of the
Security Council.
