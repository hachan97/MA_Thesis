Mrs. ngu (Nigeria): Nigeria voted in favour of
resolution 2241 (2015), renewing the mandate of the
United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS),
because we acknowledge the role ofthe Mission as vital
to stabilizing South Sudan. The tasks of the Mission are
clear: to protect civilians, to monitor and investigate
human rights, to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian
aid and to support the implementation of the ceasefire
and the Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict
in the Republic of South Sudan. Those are without a
doubt essential tasks that, in the current circumstances,
only UNMISS can perform. We welcome the adoption
of the resolution, which sends a message of support to
the brave men and women of UNMISS working in very
challenging circumstances to save lives and contribute
to the peace process in South Sudan.
