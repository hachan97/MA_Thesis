The President: There are no more names inscribed
on the list of speakers.

As this is the last scheduled meeting of the Council
for the month of November, I would like to express the
sincere appreciation of my delegation to the members
of the Council and to the Secretariat for all the support
they have given us. It has been a busy month. We have
been able to rally to consensus on several important
issues on the agenda. We could not have done it without
the hard work, support and positive contributions of
all members, their delegations, representatives of the
Secretariat, conferences services officers, interpreters,
verbatim reporters and security staff.

As we end our presidency, I know I speak on behalf
of the entire Council in wishing the delegation of the
United States good luck in the month of December.

I now invite Council members to informal
consultations to continue our discussion on the United
Nations Investigative Team to Promote Accountability
for Crimes Committed by Da'esh/Islamic State in Iraq
and the Levant.

The meeting rose at 11.40 a.m.
