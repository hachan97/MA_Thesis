The President (spoke in French): I thank the
Prosecutor for her very clear, thorough and indeed
powerful answers.

This regular dialogue with the Prosecutor and,
through her, with the tribunals is extremely useful. I
take it from Ambassador van Walsum's invitation that
we will have the pleasure of welcoming you again in
November, to which I look forward.

There are no further speakers for this meeting.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.
The Security Council will remain seized ofthe matter.

The meeting rose at 2 p.m.
