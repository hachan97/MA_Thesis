Mr. Laro (Nigeria): Nigeria is pleased to see
Guinea-Bissau on the path to recovery. Democracy,
the rule of law and good governance are taking root
in the country. The National Assembly has established
a Peace and Stability Commission to promote national
reconciliation. Security sector reform is on course and
constitutional reform is being pursued. These are all
positive signs that the Government is committed to
change.

Resolution 2203 (2015), which wasjust unanimously
adopted, conveys the Security Council's hopes for a
peaceful, stable, secure and prosperous Guinea-Bissau.
With determined action on the part of the Government,
the support of the people of Guinea-Bissau and the
sustained engagement of the international community,
we are confident that this can be attained in the very
near future.

Nigeria, as penholder, thanks members of the
Council for their constructive engagement and
flexibility, which facilitated the timely adoption of this
important resolution. We urge all stakeholders to work
diligently towards its implementation.
