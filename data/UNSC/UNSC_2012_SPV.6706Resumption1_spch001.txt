The President: Under rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure I invite the
representatives of Bahrain, Benin and the Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela to participate in this meeting.

I wish once again to remind all speakers to limit
their statements to no more than four minutes in order
to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Malaysia.
