Mrs. Nguyen (Viet Nam): At the outset, I would
like like to thank the Ministers, who came from far
away to attend this important meeting.

One year has passed since the tragedy of Malaysia
Airlines Flight MH-17, which caused the loss of the
lives of 298 passengers and crew members, among
whom were a Vietnamese family of three. Viet Nam is
grateful for the effective cooperation in the recovery
and repatriation of the victims as well as the support
for their families. We appreciate all of the efforts made
by the relevant parties to investigate this incident,
including the efforts by the Joint Investigation Team,
and we take note of the preliminary report.

Viet Nam once again reiterates our request for a
continued independent, objective and transparent
investigation, in line with resolution 2166 (2014). We
call upon all relevant parties to fully cooperate in the
investigation. We are of the view that the perpetrators
must be brought to justice through appropriate
mechanisms, in accordance with international law and
the Charter of the United Nations.

Viet Nam stands ready to work closely with all
of the parties concerned in our efforts to adequately
address this incident.
