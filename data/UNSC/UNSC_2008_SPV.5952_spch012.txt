Ms. Qwabe (South Africa): South Africa is
deeply concerned by the developments over the past
few days, which have seen the breakdown of
negotiations and an escalation of violence between
Georgia and South Ossetia. Those developments have a
destabilizing impact on the region and have contributed
to the deterioration of relations between Georgia and
the Russian Federation.

South Africa denounces the use of force and
urges all parties to the conflict to cease hostilities and
commence negotiations without delay. It is necessary
to find a solution to this long-standing dispute in
accordance with the principles of the United Nations
Charter, including the principle of the peaceful
settlement of disputes.
