The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Mwamba
Kapanga (Democratic Republic of the Congo) took a
seat at the side of the Council table.
