Mr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): Although we are still on
the item concerning Mali, because the Ambassador of
the Russian Federation mentioned my country, I would
like to react very briefly.

We took careful note of the statement made by the
Ambassador of the Russian Federation on the intention
to circulate a draft resolution on the possibility of
deploying United Nations peacekeepers in the Donbas.

There is a saying: "Water wears away the stone". I
would like to remind everybody that back in March
2015, the President of Ukraine addressed the President
of the Security Council and the Secretary-General
on the same issue, requesting the Security Council to
consider the possibility of the deployment of a United
Nations peacekeeping operation. In Ukraine, we
consider that such deployment could greatly contribute
to the restoration of peace and security in the east of
Ukraine, which was undermined, as everyone knows,
as a result of Russia's aggression and continued support
of the separatists in Donbas.

Having said that, we consider that the mandate
of such a mission should be carefully crafted, and
our delegation is ready to take an active part in its
consideration as soon as the Security Council delegation
comes back from Ethiopia.

The meeting rose at10.20 a.m.
