Mr. Dumitru (Romania): In joining our
Multinational Force (MNF) partners in sponsoring the
resolution, Romania had in view, first of all, the letter
received by the President of the Security Council from
the Iraqi Government, requesting the extension of the
mandates of the MNF, the International Advisory and
Monitoring Board and the Development Fund for Iraq,
as provided in Security Council resolution 1546
(2004). We believe that the Council ought to rally to
that request and articulate its response with the same
understanding of timing and effectiveness. Extending
those mandates now will allow the Iraqis to focus on
preparing for what is the most important step yet in
their political transition.

We very much welcome the constructive work by
the members of the Council during the negotiations on
the draft resolution, which enabled the unanimous
adoption of the text. The final text is well balanced and
is an appropriate response to the specific requests of
the Iraqi Government.

I wish to conclude by stating, in a nutshell, that
Romania has repeatedly affirmed her support for the
actions of the Iraqi Government to ensure durable
stability, an effective reconstruction process and a
democratic transition process. Romania will remain
engaged in Iraq for as along as our presence and
assistance are needed by the Iraqi people and
Government.
