Mr. Ettalhi (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in Arabic): What we have heard at this meeting from the
representatives of the Russian Federation and of
Georgia clearly demonstrates the deterioration of the
situation and its serious implications for international
peace and security. My country wishes to express its
deepest regret at the outbreak of violence in the region.
We particularly regret the large number of casualties
among civilians and peacekeepers.

We call for an immediate ceasefire and a return to
the pre-conflict situation. We call for peaceful
negotiations and an end to provocation. We express the
hope that the Security Council will stand up and send a
strong message commensurate with the gravity of the
situation that has exploded in the region.
