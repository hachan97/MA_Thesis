Mr. Cappagli (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish):
The Argentine Republic will vote in favour of the draft
resolution submitted for our consideration whereby the
mandate of the United Nations Organization Mission in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) is
extended until 15 December. We believe the extension
is necessary, but we also feel that MONUC's presence,
at least under the current concept of operations, cannot
be indefinite.

As long as reasonable guarantees of freedom of
movement and security for MONUC do not exist and
serious violations of the ceasefire persist, we believe
the second phase of MONUC deployment is not
possible. We call upon all the parties to use this two-
month period to unambiguously reaffirm their
commitment to MONUC and to the Lusaka Agreement.

We are convinced that there is no military
solution to the conflict in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo. In our View, the Lusaka Agreement
represents the basis for a stable solution that respects
the territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo and takes into consideration the legitimate
security interests of all the States in the Great Lakes
region. Therefore, all possible formulas and
alternatives to bring about the real implementation of
the Lusaka Agreement should be explored.

We have said this before, and we wish to repeat it
once more today: the United Nations has a historic role
and responsibility in the Democratic Republic of the

Congo that cannot be circumvented, but the United
Nations cannot replace the parties' political will to
make peace and live in peace.
