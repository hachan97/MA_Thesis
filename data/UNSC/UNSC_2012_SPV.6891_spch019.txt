Mr. Moussa: Having listened to all the comments
made by the members of the Security Council this
afternoon, I would just like to indicate that the
importance of those comments and suggestions on the
early implementation of the Lord's Resistance Army
strategy cannot be overemphasized.

I have also noted with attention all the comments
made this afternoon, be they on regional coordination,
joint planning or the need to strengthen collaboration.
I have taken note as well of the need for further
inter-mission cooperation and inter-region cooperation;
the importance of the protection of civilians; the issue
of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration;
human rights; and continued humanitarian support for
affected populations.

I have further taken note of members' comments
on elections. As much as we welcome what has
happened, we should continue - and my Office should
continue - to support the Governments of the region
to make sure that the issue of governance continues to
remain at the top of their agendas. I also note the issue
of information-sharing and the response to piracy in the
Gulf of Guinea.

I thank the Council for the comments I have heard
about the work being carried out by my colleagues
in the United Nations peacekeeping missions in the
subregion.

I wish to say that I feel honoured and pleased
to have received so many positive comments this
afternoon, and I want to thank all the members of the
Council. I will make sure that I share their comments
and positive remarks on the work of my Office with all
my colleagues, who are called upon on a daily basis to
carry out these assignments.

I want to take this opportunity to wish the members
of the Council in advance a Merry Christmas and a
Happy New Year.
