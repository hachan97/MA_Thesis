Mr. Alotaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): Kuwait
voted in favour of resolution 2440 (2018), extending
the mandate of the United Nations Mission for the
Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) until
30 April 2019. We had hoped for the mandate to be
extended for a full year, in line with the recommendation
of the Secretary-General.

We stress the importance of the role undertaken
by MINURSO and the complete fulfilment of its
mandate. We also express our support for the efforts
of the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy for
Western Sahara, Mr. Horst Kohler, to implement the
Security Council's resolutions with a view to achieving
a just, lasting, practical and realistic political solution
acceptable by both sides. We support the upcoming
negotiations called for by the Personal Envoy, to be
held in Geneva on 5 and 6 December. We welcome
the acceptance by all relevant parties of the invitation
to participate in the round-table meeting without
preconditions and in good faith.

We renew our full support for the Moroccan initiative
pertaining to the autonomy of Western Sahara, which
represents a constructive choice aimed at achieving a
solution acceptable to all parties. We underscore the
need to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity
of Morocco. We also welcome Morocco's credible and
serious measures and initiatives, as well as its positive
interaction with the special procedures of the Human
Rights Council.
