Mr. Dabbashi (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in Arabic): We wish to thank Ambassador Jan Grauls,
Chairman of the Security Council Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1737 (2006) and
representative of Belgium, for his valuable briefing, in
which he reviewed the work accomplished by the
Committee over the past 90 days.

Libya once again reaffirms the importance of
intensifying international efforts to achieve a peaceful
settlement of the dispute over the Iranian nuclear issue,
in accordance with paragraph 15 of Security Council
resolution 1803 (2008), on further enhancing
6

diplomatic efforts to promote resumption of dialogue
and consultations with Iran, with a view to seeking a
comprehensive, long-term and appropriate solution to
this issue that would allow for the development of all-
round relations and fruitful cooperation with Iran based
on mutual respect and international confidence in the
exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear
programme. In this context, we call on all parties to
begin direct negotiations as soon as possible in order to
achieve that goal.

Libya expresses once again its firm belief that all
efforts to address non-proliferation and nuclear
disarmament should be comprehensive and
non-selective and that all countries, without exception,
should subject their nuclear facilities to the
comprehensive safeguards regime of the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We express our regret
that the Security Council has not devoted careful
attention to the Israeli nuclear-weapon issue, despite
the fact that Israel continues to refuse to accede to the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
(NPT) and to subject its nuclear facilities to the IAEA
safeguards regime. That makes it impossible to fulfil
the aspirations of the peoples of the Middle East to
establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone, in accordance
with the resolution on the Middle East adopted at the
1995 Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT and
the relevant General Assembly resolutions.
