Mr. Sadykov (Kazakhstan): As we said yesterday
(see S/PV.8l()5), Kazakhstan attaches great importance
to the continuation of the work of the Organization for
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations
Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM). The possible
ways of improving the structure and the mandate of the
Mechanism are a subject worthy of further discussion
and negotiations. In that regard, the proposed technical
draft resolution has a special provision for the
possibility of a break in the continued operation of the
Mechanism, and is acceptable to my delegation. That is
why we supported draft resolution S/2017/970.

It is regrettable that we were unable to save the
Joint Investigative Mechanism. My delegation calls
on the parties concerned to continue dialogue so as
to find common ground. Should there be a need with
regard to mediation assistance in order to bring the two
sides together and reconcile their divergent positions,
Kazakhstan stands ready to take such an initiative.
Time is of the essence, and we see a great need for all
of us to arrive at a mutually satisfying path leading
towards a unified vision for the future of the JIM.
