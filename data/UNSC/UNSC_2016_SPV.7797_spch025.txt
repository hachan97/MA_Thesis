Mr. O'Brien: Extremely briefly, Ijust wanted to
reiterate that the best humanitarian response is to find
a way forward to peace, and I would certainly urge all
to get behind the plan put forward by the Special Envoy.

I just want to give total assurance to the
representative of the United States that if we have
access, then we can certainly make sure that we go
through an extraordinary level of surge in order to meet
the needs, providing we are given the resources to do
so; I am confident that we will be given the chance.
I call on all parties to respect all provisions for the
protection of civilians, and at the same time I wish to
add my voice to those that have lauded the incredible
bravery of the aid workers who are getting significant
amounts of aid through, even in these very challenging
times of an absolutely vast humanitarian requirement
of 21.2 million people in need.

As was reiterated by the President himself, this is a
catastrophe, and that is why I am calling for us to take
immediate steps to do what we can to get to grips with it.
