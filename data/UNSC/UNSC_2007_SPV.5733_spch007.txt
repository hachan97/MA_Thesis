Mr. Kleib (Indonesia): The unanimous adoption
of resolution 1773 (2007), which extends the mandate
of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL) for 12 months, reflects the continued
commitment of the Security Council and the United
Nations to the realization of a peaceful and stable
Lebanon. After one year of its deployment, UNIFIL not
only has provided the Lebanese with the opportunity to
rebuild and restore the country's daily life, but also has
helped to establish a new strategic military and security
environment in southern Lebanon.

The extension of UNIFIL's mandate and the
mission's continued presence in Lebanon will bring
greater tangible results only when all parties concerned
fulfil their obligations under resolution 1701 (2006),
including the obligation to provide detailed data on the
use of cluster munitions in southern Lebanon. All
parties must also exercise restraint with regard to
actions that could undermine resolution 1701 (2006)
and UNIFIL, including the continued violations of
Lebanon's airspace. Regrettably, the resolution does
not address that matter in an appropriate way. Lebanese
sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected
in their entirety.

The permanent ceasefire, as envisaged by
resolution 1701 (2006), is still far from being a reality.
The role of UNIFIL in monitoring the cessation of
hostilities and in achieving a permanent ceasefire
remains critical. Thus, extending the mandate of
UNIFIL is of paramount importance.

Finally, Indonesia wishes to reaffirm its
commitment to UNIFIL through its unflagging political
support as well as the continued presence of its
contingent in Lebanon and its intended contribution of
additional assets to UNIFIL's Maritime Task Force.
