The President (spoke in French): I shall now make
a statement in my capacity as representative of Gabon.

The Gabonese delegation deeply regrets the events
that occurred at the Embassy of the People's Republic of
China in Belgrade, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It is
extremely important that all measures be taken to ensure
the protection of ministries and diplomatic personnel
accredited to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as well
as their property. We deeply deplore the material damage
and the loss of human life caused by this incident. We
extend our sincere condolences to the Government of the
People's Republic of China and to the bereaved families.
We call on the Belgrade authorities to seize this
opportunity offered them by the Secretary-General of the

 

United Nations through his initiative to facilitate a peaceful
settlement of the crisis in Kosovo.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

In accordance with the decision taken earlier in the
meeting, I now invite Mr. J ovanovie to make a statement.
