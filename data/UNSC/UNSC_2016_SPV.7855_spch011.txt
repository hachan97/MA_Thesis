Mr. Seck (Senegal) (spoke in French): There are no
military solutions to the protracted and complex Syrian
crisis. That is a conclusion the Security Council has
reached repeatedly here in this Chamber, and that is why
the Senegalese delegation, having backed resolution
2236 (2016), submitted by the Russian Federation, is
gratified to see that it enjoyed unanimous support.
The Senegalese delegation reaffirms that a solution
conducive to the resolution of the crisis in the Syrian
Arab Republic will involve a political process, without
exception, and be Syrian-led on the basis of the Geneva
communique (S/2012/522, annex), as underscored
in the various resolutions adopted by the Council, in
particular resolutions 2118 (2013), 2254 (2015) and
2268 (2016).

The Senegalese delegation is gratified by the fact
that this resolution refers to swift and unimpeded
access for humanitarian assistance throughout Syrian
territory. For that reason our delegation would like to
congratulate the delegation of the Russian Federation for
its constructive spirit and the flexibility it consistently
demonstrated throughout the negotiation process of
what has today become resolution 2336 (2016). There
could be no nicer gift for the Syrian people, who have
suffered so long from this conflict.

Before I conclude, I would like to convey to the
Spanish delegation and to Ambassador Oyarzun
Marchesi the warm congratulations of the Senegalese
delegation for a very productive Council presidency
during the month of December. I wish you a happy
new year.
