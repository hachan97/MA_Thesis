The President (spoke in Russian): I want to
apologize to the representative of Ukraine, who was
on the list right after the United Kingdom. But my eye
accidentally jumped to France and I gave the floor to
the representative of France, which I do not regret. I
now give the floor to the representative of Ukraine.
