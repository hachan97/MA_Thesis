Mr. Ibrahim (Malaysia): I thank Ms. Bensouda for
her briefing. We have taken note of the twenty-third
report of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal
Court, on the situation in Darfur, submitted pursuant
resolution 1593 (2005) and the activities of the Office
of the Prosecutor since her last report.

Malaysia remains concerned with the humanitarian
and security situation in Darfur. The ongoing conflicts
have resulted in civilian deaths, including of women
and children, as well as more than 129,000 people
displaced from Jebel Marra since mid-January. Given
the deplorable situation, all parties to the conflict are
reminded of their obligations under international human
rights law and international humanitarian law and
must refrain from all acts of violence against civilians,
including humanitarian and peacekeeping personnel.
It is therefore incumbent upon the Government of
the Sudan to create an enabling environment where
trust and confidence can be built. In this respect, its
compliance with relevant Security Council resolutions
would be the necessary prerequisite towards that end.

The protracted conflict in Darfur clearly indicates
that there is no military solution that will not bring
dire consequences or prolong destruction and human
suffering. It is for this reason that we welcome the
signing of the road map agreement by the Government
of the Sudan in March as a commendable step forward.
The parties that have not yet signed the agreement
should be encouraged to do so urgently and engage
constructively in a dialogue.

We also welcome the resumption of the work of the
joint working group to deliberate on cooperation with
the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation
in Darfur. In the light of the spirit of constructive
engagement by the Government of the Sudan, it is
hoped that this will mark a new phase of collaboration
with the United Nations, the African Union and other
international partners towards peace and security
in the country.
