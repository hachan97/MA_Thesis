The President (spoke in French): I thank Mr.
Nelson Mandela for his comprehensive briefing and for
his kind words addressed to me.

In their prior consultations, the members of the
Council agreed on the text of a presidential statement
supportive of the Facilitator's efforts.

The text of that statement is being made
available, and will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2000/29.

The Security Council has thus concluded its
business for this meeting. Bearing in mind the decision
taken in the Council's prior consultations, I shall
adjourn the meeting now. The Council will continue its
consideration of the item in a private meeting with
former President Mandela immediately following the
adjournment of this meeting.

The meeting rose at 11.15 am.
