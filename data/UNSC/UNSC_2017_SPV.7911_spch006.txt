Mr. Zalyalov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian delegation voted in favour of
resolution 2349 (2017), on the situation in the Lake
Chad basin, owing to the importance of maintaining
consensus in the Security Council and given that
the language of the document was acceptable to the
representatives of the region. However, we believe that
it is necessary to stress that not all of our comments
and arguments were incorporated into the text of
the resolution.

First of all, we believe that is inaccurate to consider
the situation in the Lake Chad basin a conflict. Boko
Haram was included in the Security Council's list
of terrorist organizations. In March 2015, the group
proclaimed its allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq
and the Levant. That means that combating the group
is, above all, a counter-terrorism operation. We regret
that the authors of the draft resolution did not refer to
that well-founded description of the situation.

Moreover, one of the important causes behind the
deterioration of the situation and the rampant terrorism
in the States of the region was not mentioned, namely,

the irresponsible policy of interfering in the internal
affairs of neighbouring States, in particular Libya.
Like others, we have repeatedly asked our United
Kingdom colleagues not to rush the adoption of
the resolution simply because the mandate of their
presidency was ending, but they did not listen to us.
The final document is therefore partially unfinished
and unbalanced. We hope that our comments will be
taken into consideration with regard to future work.
