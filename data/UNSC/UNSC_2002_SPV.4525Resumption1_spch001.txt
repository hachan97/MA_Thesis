The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter dated 3 May 2002
from the Vice-Chairman of the Committee on the
Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian
People, which reads as follows:

"In my capacity as Vice-Chairman of the
Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable
Rights of the Palestinian People, I have the
honour to request that I be invited to participate
in the debate on the situation in the Middle East,
including the Palestinian question, under rule 39
of the provisional rules of procedure of the
Security Council."

On previous occasions, the Security Council has
extended invitations to representatives of other United
Nations bodies in connection with the consideration of
matters on its agenda. In accordance with past practice
in this matter, I propose that the Council extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to the Vice-Chairman of the Committee on
the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian
People.

I invite Mr. Ravan A. G. Farhadi to take the seat
reserved for him at the side of the Council Chamber.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Jordan. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
