Mr. Fonseca (Brazil): Brazil would prefer to be here
today adopting a draft resolution that would allow us to
start phase VII of the oil-for-food programme. We attach
the greatest importance to the maintenance and
improvement of the programme. It will continue to be
essential to the well-being of the Iraqi people so long as
sanctions remain in place.

However, agreement with regard to the draft text
originally presented has not been possible. We regret that.
So, we support this technical draft resolution, which
simply extends the current phase for two weeks. We hope
that those two weeks can be used constructively by the
Security Council members involved in the discussions on
a comprehensive draft resolution. Our expectation is that
the comprehensive draft resolution can be adopted by
consensus. The unity of the 15 Security Council members
with regard to a text that redefines the relationship

 

between the United Nations and Iraq will be a very
important sign for the international community. It will
demonstrate that the United Nations is ready and willing to
address this question through dialogue, diplomacy and
multilateralism.
