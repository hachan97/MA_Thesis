Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I will be brief, but
I want to thank the Turkish representative for again
setting out the Turkish plan. All of us have listened
very carefully to the Astana briefers. We do not want
to detract from the Astana efforts; we support any
move that gets the political process under way. But we
have heard only one plan today for trying to avert the
bloodshed in Idlib and actually make a difference on
the ground. I would urge all Security Council members
to rally around the plan that our Turkish colleague has
set out.

What worries me is that instead we have heard
a narrative that restoring full Syrian control over its
territory is synonymous with fighting terrorists. For
the people of Idlib that is not the equation. The people
of Idlib are going to suffer terribly if this military
assault goes ahead. It is precisely for these situations
that the doctrine of proportionality under international
humanitarian law exists.

I therefore hope that the Council can come together
over the coming days to talk further about how we can
maximize the political process, building on Astana's
efforts but as well having a very serious discussion
about how we can avert an all-out military attack on
the people of Idlib.

The meeting rose at 12.50p.m.
