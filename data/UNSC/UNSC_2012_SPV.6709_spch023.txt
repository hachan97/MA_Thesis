Mr. Tchingonbe Patchanne (Chad) (spoke in French): As this is the first time that my country takes
the floor, I would like to take this opportunity to wish
you a happy new year, Mr. President, as well as to all
our colleagues here. I also wish to commend the efforts
made by the team of experts that carried out an
assessment mission on the impact of the Libyan crisis
on the countries of the Sahel region.

As the Council is aware, thanks to its huge oil
resources, before the crisis Libya was a country that
drew migrant workers of various nationalities. My
12-21580

country, Chad, is one of the countries of the Sahel
region with a large number of its nationals living in
Libya. Today, more than 80 per cent of them have been
able to return to their country thanks to the support of
the International Organization for Migration, which I
would like to thank for its dedication to humanitarian
concerns.

Chad attaches great interest to the conclusions
and recommendations of the mission, and we welcome
the fact that the Secretary-General decided to establish
it. We would also like the Council to devote to the
report all the attention it deserves, so as to prompt the
international community to lend its support to the
countries of the Sahel region in order that they can win
the war against underdevelopment, famine, poverty and
insecurity.

With regard to the circulation of weaponry in the
Sahel region and the threat it poses to its countries, His
Excellency President Idriss Deby Itno sounded the
alarm even before the fall of the Al-Qadhafi regime.
Nevertheless, the situation continues to be one of
concern given the long border separating our two
countries, over which it is difficult to exercise control.

All those challenges that the countries of the
region must face are made worse by the impact of the
Libyan crisis.
