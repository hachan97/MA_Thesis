Mr. Katende (Uganda): Uganda has been part of
the decisions taken by the Intergovernmental Authority
on Development (IGAD) and the African Union
concerning the situation in Somalia and the border
dispute between Djibouti and Eritrea. Uganda remains
committed to those decisions and hopes that the
Security Council will respond positively to the requests
made to it by IGAD and the African Union, including
taking measures against all those countries,
organizations and individuals identified as being
directly or indirectly involved in providing human,
financial or technical support to Al-Shabaab and
Hizbul Islam militias and terrorists in the Horn of
Africa.

We are particularly concerned because of what
has happened to us in the past. We are also concerned,
because we have troops in Somalia and with the
African Union Mission in Somalia. We want those
troops to do their job, accomplish that job and return
home safely.
