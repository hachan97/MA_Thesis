Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We endorse the words of sympathy and
condolence that have been expressed over the deaths
of the Tanzanian peacekeepers in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo. We express our condolences to
all the relatives and friends of the people of Tanzania
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo who died
and wish the injured a speedy recovery.

The Russian delegation voted in favour of resolution
2391 (2017), on the provision of technical and material
support to the Joint Force of the Group of Five for the
Sahel because of the importance of the international
community providing assistance to that regional
alliance. The Joint Force, approved under resolution
2359 (2017), provides an appropriate response to the
challenges in the Sahel region in line with the principle
that African problems requires African soluitions.
We are convinced that that is the only way to achieve
lasting peace in Africa.

We believe that it is important to assist the Joint
Force, since it will not only face counter-terrorism
challenges but also seek to eradicate cross-border
criminal groups that fuel terrorism. We welcome the
rapid deployment of the Joint Force on the ground and
the fact that the first operation has taken place. We
encourage the strengthened cooperation among the
participants in the Joint Force on the future deployment
of troops in line with the agreed planning. We would
once again underscore that only the truly coordinated
efforts of all members of the regional Sahel group,
without exception, can lead to effective results.

In conclusion, we would like to point out that,
in this era of globalization, terrorism has become
global in nature. That threat can be eradicated only by
presenting the broadest possible front, for which Russia
has long been calling. We will continue to provide
concrete assistance to the people of the Sahel through
our bilateral channels.
