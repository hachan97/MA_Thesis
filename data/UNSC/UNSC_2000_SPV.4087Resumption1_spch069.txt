The President: I thank the representative of Senegal
for his special reference to the role of the Security
Council on this issue, which certainly echoes the views of
most of us here and, speaking as the American
representative, our own.

There are no more speakers on my list. I would like
to make some observations about what we have done
today, but, with members' permission, since we have been
here now for nine hours, I would like to reserve those for
the beginning of our Thursday meeting on refugees, when
High Commissioner Ogata will be with us. The
connection between refugees and this issue has been
noted by several speakers today. I believe the Minister of
Health of Namibia made a specific point of it, as did
some others. There is thus a natural connection between
them.

The meeting rose at 6.55 p.m.
