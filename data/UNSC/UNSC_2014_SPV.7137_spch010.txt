Mr. Gasana (Rwanda) (spoke in French): I will not
waste your time, Madam President. I have just a small
rectification to make here. You will understand why,
Madam. I am Rwandan. I would not say it otherwise.

I would like to tell my dear colleague, the
representative of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, that we are not going to celebrate the Rwandan
genocide. I know that ours is not the language ofMoliere
and Voltaire, but what we are going to do on 7 April
is commemorate the genocide perpetrated against the
Tutsi in Rwanda. I wanted to make that rectification.
We are not going to celebrate. That is all.
