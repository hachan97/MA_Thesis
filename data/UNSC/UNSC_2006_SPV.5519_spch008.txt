Mr. Vassilakis (Greece): Greece voted in favour
of resolution 1706 (2006) because it believes that,
given the deteriorating humanitarian and security
situation in Darfur, the Security Council had to
shoulder its responsibilities and act swiftly. As we have
argued on this and on other occasions, when the
Council is faced with a humanitarian crisis it has a
moral duty to act expeditiously to stop human
suffering.

The resolution provides for the immediate
strengthening of the African Union Mission in the
Sudan (AMIS) and the expansion of the mandate of the
United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS) to
cover Darfur. In addition, it contains language that
ensures the effective protection of civilians and
humanitarian workers as well as humanitarian access.
In our view, those components are crucial to the
Council's comprehensive strategy in Darfur.

Notwithstanding the above, the resolution does
not mark the end of the road; rather, it constitutes a
significant step in the right direction and towards a
new beginning. The resolution contains the important
element of the consent of the Government of National
Unity to the deployment of UNMIS to Darfur. It offers
the Government of the Sudan the opportunity to
cooperate with the Council in implementing the
resolution.

In that respect, resolution 1706 (2006) should be
seen as part of the Council's continuous engagement
with the Government of the Sudan to advance
cooperation with it and to persuade it to reconsider its
position. Continuous consultations with other
stakeholders, such as the African Union, the League of
Arab States and the Organization of the Islamic
Conference, is also particularly pertinent in that regard.

In closing, I can assure members that Greece will
be very helpful with regard to the smooth
implementation of this resolution.
