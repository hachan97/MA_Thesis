The President (spoke in French): I shall now make
a statement in my national capacity.

I too wish to thank Ambassador Gary Quinlan,
Chair of the Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1737 (2006), for his briefing. Chad takes
note of the quarterly report just presented by the
Chair on the activities of the Committee from
September to December. We commend the assistance
and guidance provided by the Committee to Member
States and international organizations concerning the
implementation of Security Council measures. We urge
the Committee to pursue its activities and to strengthen
its communications with Member States, in particular
through country visits, so as to encourage them to
submit national implementation reports regarding
Security Council measures.

Regarding negotiations between Iran and the P5+1
in the framework of the Joint Plan of Action, we regret
that the negotiations aimed at resolving the nuclear
issue continued through 24 November without leading
to a decisive agreement. We note, nevertheless, that
the negotiations resumed yesterday, 17 December, in
Geneva, Switzerland, and are scheduled to continue to
30 June 2015. It is our hope that those diplomatic efforts
towards a comprehensive long-term solution will bear
fruit in this round.

In conclusion, given that Ambassador Quinlan has
taken the floor before the Council for the last time in
his capacity as Chair of the 1737 Committee, on behalf
of my delegation I would like to pay a heartfelt tribute
to him and his entire team for their leadership and
commitment at the head of 1737 Committee over the
past two years. I wish every success to his successor,
the Permanent Representative of Spain.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

There are no more names inscribed on the list of
speakers. The Security Council has thus concluded
the present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 4.15 pJ'Vl.
