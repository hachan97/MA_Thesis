Mr. Mahugu (Kenya): Let me first take this
opportunity to thank the sponsors for a much-improved
text. We welcome the changes that they have made
following our informal consultations. As we stated earlier,
we were concerned about the connotation of permanence
of the oil-for-food programme, which was implied in the
earlier draft that we considered. It is our understanding
that this is not an issue and that the provisional and
temporary nature of the oil-for-food programme is neither
in doubt nor being questioned. It has always been and
remains our conviction that the programme will - and,
indeed, must - come to an end as soon as paragraph 22
of resolution 687 (1991) is implemented.

Our other major concern relating to the mechanism
for the approval of contracts for spare parts was not fully
addressed. In our View, the procedure spelt out in the
draft resolution before us remains cumbersome and might
in fact unnecessarily complicate what the Secretary-
General intended to be a straightforward procedure to
address what he considered to be a severe hindrance to
the success of the humanitarian programme.

This notwithstanding, and fully cognizant that there
continues to be a humanitarian crisis in Iraq which must
be addressed urgently, my delegation will join in the
consensus and vote in favour of the draft resolution, in
the hope that today's action of the Council will help
alleviate the humanitarian situation now prevailing in Iraq.
