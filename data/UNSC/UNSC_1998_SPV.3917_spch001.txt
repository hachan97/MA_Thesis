The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.

Members of the Security Council have before them
document 8/1998/760, which contains the text of a letter
dated 7 August 1998 from the Secretary-General addressed
to the President of the Security Council regarding the
nominations which have been received for judges of the
Trial Chambers of the International Tribunal for Rwanda.
In this connection, the members of the Council will note
the information contained in the Secretary-General's
letter.

Members of the Council also have before them the
draft of a letter which I, as President of the Security
Council, would propose to send to the Secretary-General
in reply to the aforementioned letter, informing him of the
decision by the Council to extend the deadline for
nominations of judges of the Tribunal until 14 September
1998.

In the absence of objection, I shall assume that the
Security Council agrees that I should send the letter as
drafted to the Secretary-General.

It is so decided.

The reply will be issued as a document of the
Council under the symbol 8/1998/761.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The Council remains seized of the item.
The meeting rose at 11.45 am.
