The President: I thank the Chairman of the
Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of
the Palestinian People for his kind words addressed to
me.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Kuwait. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
