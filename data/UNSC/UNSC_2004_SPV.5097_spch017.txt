The President (spoke in Arabic): I now will
make a statement on behalf of Algeria.

First, I would like to thank the Chairman of the
1540 Committee, Ambassador Motoc, for the valuable
report. I also would like to thank the 1540 Committee
for its tireless work during recent months.
Considerable progress has actually been made since the
adoption of resolution 1540 (2004) in eliminating the
danger inherent in weapons of mass destruction if they
should fall into the hands of non-State actors and
entities. We believe that the measures adopted in the
resolution will constitute a collective response to that
danger and protection from it. We strongly believe that
the best way to eliminate that peril is the total
elimination of weapons of mass destruction.

There are three subcommittees and guidelines to
facilitate the work of the Committee. They, together
with national reports, comprise the machinery for
implementing resolution 1540 (2004) and show how
very much Member States are determined to comply
with their obligations. My delegation would like to
thank States that have submitted national reports under
operative paragraph 4 of the resolution. The Committee
should be able to ensure that those States that need
assistance can get it. Four experts have been appointed
to assist the Committee in studying the reports of the
Member States, in addition to their other duties. We
expect that two more experts will be appointed soon on
the basis of equitable geographic distribution and in
conformity with the guidelines that govern the
appointment of experts to Committees.

I now resume my function as President of the
Council.

There are no more speakers inscribed on my list.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 11.25 am.
