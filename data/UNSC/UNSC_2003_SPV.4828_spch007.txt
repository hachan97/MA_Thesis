Mr. Mufioz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): My
delegation voted in favour of the draft resolution
because it reflected our views. The Government of
Chile unequivocally condemned the Government of
Israel's announcement with regard to the removal from
the occupied territories of the President of the
Palestinian National Authority. Such an action would
not contribute to the achievement of peace in the
Middle East and would go against the dignity of a
people and its Authority - an Authority that was
legitimately established on the basis of a democratic
process.

We would have preferred a consensus resolution.
The non-approval of the draft resolution did not,
however, prevent our voting in favour of it. But we fear
that this situation will not be helpful to the political
process in the Middle East or to the implementation of
the road map. Nonetheless, we believe that all
necessary efforts must be made to return to peace
negotiations within the framework of international law,
in strict compliance with United Nations resolutions
and with the commitments solemnly undertaken at the
Aqaba Summit for the effective implementation of the
road map of the Madrid Quartet.

This afternoon's developments, however, are not
a cause for optimism. We must now think about the
need for perseverance and patience so that we can
again, perhaps, take up our efforts for peace that the
people of Palestine and Israel deserve.
