Sir Brian Urquhart: I greatly appreciated having
a chance to listen to this very serious, thought-
provoking and, indeed, quite imaginative debate on an
extremely important and really very difficult subject. I
have absolutely nothing to add to the many ideas and
suggestions that have been put forward.

Coming back here after many years, I am
impressed all over again, I must say, by the way the
Security Council is a curious combination of formality
and informality. Of course, the informal side would
inevitably lose its value if it were ever publicized. But
what impresses me is the reality of 15 highly qualified
and dedicated delegations working together day and
night on a wide variety of problems - and most of the
time working as a team. I think that is a very
encouraging sign of the vitality of the Security Council
and also of a great deal more work on the peaceful
settlement of disputes than the public at large has any
idea of. Of course, the formal development of the
means of peaceful settlement of disputes may well be a
great deal slower to come about. I hope very much that
suggestions made in this debate will serve to speed up
that very important process.
