Mr. Ben Mustapha (Tunisia) (spoke in French):
I wish to express my most sincere thanks to you, Mr.
President, for the very kind words you have addressed
to me as my mission in the Security Council is coming
to an end.

I also wish to thank your delegation and all my
colleagues - current members of the Security Council
and those who left the Council last year- for the
cooperation, understanding and the spirit of friendship
that have marked and continue to mark our collective
work for the cause of peace and security in the world. I
have shared with you, my dear colleagues and friends,
some of the most memorable moments in my long
career of diplomatic service to my country, and I think
such moments are also highlights in the careers of all
representatives in this very important body.

Indeed, the Security Council makes history, and
we are part of it. I have had the honour, the privilege
and, of course, the responsibility of representing my
country in this body, and, with you, I have contributed
to the consideration of many important issues and the
search for solutions to the many questions of which the
Council is seized. I wish to repeat to the members of
the Council and the Secretariat my utmost gratitude for
the cooperation and support they gave to me and my
delegation during the Tunisian presidency of the
Council last month.

I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate
you, Mr. President, and your delegation on the
remarkable work you have accomplished this month, a
month of abundant activity. I wish you the greatest
success. The kind words you have addressed to me are
clearly not only for myself, but also for my delegation
and my country, Tunisia. I wish to assure you, Mr.
President and dear colleagues and representatives, of
the Tunisian delegation's continued cooperation in
accomplishing your noble common task. Again, I wish
you the greatest success.
