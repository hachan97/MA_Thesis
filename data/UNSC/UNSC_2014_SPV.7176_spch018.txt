The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as the representative of the Republic of Korea.
My delegation welcomes to the Council High
Representative Valentin Inzko. We appreciate his
briefing.

While we acknowledge recent positive developments
such as the appointment of Constitutional Court
judges, it is disappointing that the lack of agreement
among political actors continues to have a negative
impact on the overall reform process in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. We are also concerned that the ongoing
political gridlock has undermined the country's
progress towards Euro-Atlantic integration and fanned
economic hardship, producing high unemployment.
The protests that started in early February obviously
attest to the frustration of the people. Another worrying
trend is the increased divisive rhetoric challenging the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.
Commitment to the unity of Bosnia and Herzegovina
as one sovereign country is the very foundation of the
Dayton Peace Agreement. We reiterate our full support
for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia
and Herzegovina.

Given the current lack of ownership by political
stakeholders, the plenums that emerged as a platform
for civil society are a welcome development. We hope
that new form of constructive political discourse can
help to enhance accountability in the politics of Bosnia
and Herzegovina. We also call for more dialogue
among all political stakeholders with a view to bringing
about concrete reforms, including the long-overdue
implementation of the Sejdie- Finci ruling. We hope
that the elections in October will provide momentum
with which the country can move forward towards a
more equitable democracy.

Before I conclude, I would like again to express our
full support for the efforts of the High Representative.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
