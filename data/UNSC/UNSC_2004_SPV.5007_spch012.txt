Mr. Van Den Berg (Netherlands): Sir, the
European Union is honoured by your presence here
today presiding over the Security Council's
deliberations today. We also welcome the participation
of the Secretary-General and of Mr. Luis Ernesto
Delbez, who chaired the high-level of the Security
Council on regional organizations last year.

The European Union welcomes the Romanian
initiative to carry this issue forward focusing on
cooperation and stabilization processes.

As the Council is aware, Javier Solana, the High
Representative for the European Union's Common
Foreign and Security Policy, whom it had invited to
participate in this meeting, cannot be here today. He
has therefore designated Mr. Peter Feith, Deputy
Director-General for European Security and Defence
Policy of the Council Secretariat to speak on his behalf.

Heeding your call for brevity, Sir, I would
therefore ask you to give the floor to Mr. Feith.
