Mr. Quinlan (Australia): Australia remains
committed to a future where Israeli and a Palestinian
State exist side by side in peace and security within
internationally recognized borders. As such, our efforts
must be focused on constructively encouraging the
parties to return to direct negotiations towards that goal.
Regrettably, the draft resolution under consideration
today (S/2014/916) will not help this process, and that
is why we voted against it. It lacks balance and seeks
to impose a solution put forward by one party alone.
Final status issues can be resolved only between the
two sides; a process agreed by both sides is the only
way forward to reach an enduring agreement.

The violence experienced in recent months in the
Palestinian territories and Israel underlines the terrible
human costs of the failure of final status negotiations
and how fragile the situation is in the absence of
genuine progress towards establishing a Palestinian
State, an objective in which Australia believes and to
which we are committed. Australia urges all parties to
refrain from provocative actions and leaders from both
sides to show real courage in returning to the difficult
path of peace negotiations.
