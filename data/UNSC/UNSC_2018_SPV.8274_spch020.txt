The President (spoke in Russian): I shall now make
a statement in my capacity as the representative of the
Russian Federation.

The Russian Federation voted against draft
resolution S/2018/520, submitted by the United States,
on the situation in the Palestinian occupied territories,
although we would be ready to agree with some of its
provisions. We certainly recognize Israel's right to
security. Our vote is connected to the fact the document
represents the latest attempt by the United States to
revise the international legal basis for a settlement in
the Middle East. Not only that, it also included elements
that do not correspond to Russia's position. The United

States has repeatedly urged the members ofthe Security
Council to maintain a balanced view when considering
crisis situations in the Middle East. However, it upset
that balance in its own draft resolution.
We are concerned about the fact that the draft
resolution of the United States did not include any
calls for creating conditions conducive to resuming
talks on final status issues, with the aim of finding a
path to a lasting settlement on the basis of a two-State
solution for both Israel and Palestine, which would
exist in security within internationally recognized
borders. Even references to the Arab Peace Initiative
and the Middle East Quartet, which remains the
unique mediation mechanism approved by the Security
Council, were removed.

We encourage the commencement of practical
work aimed at launching direct Palestinian-
Israeli negotiations.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

I give the floor to the Permanent Observer of the
Observer State of Palestine.
