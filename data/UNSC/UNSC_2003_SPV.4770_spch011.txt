Mr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): I am
grateful to Mr. Annabi for his briefing. As Greece,
speaking on behalf of the European Union, will be
making a statement which Spain fully supports, I will
limit myself to a few brief observations.

Events in recent weeks show that there is a long
way to go on the road towards a multi-ethnic Kosovo
based on the principles ofjustice, tolerance and respect
for human rights. We are concerned in particular by the
fact that there continue to be serious acts of violence,
threats and cases of intimidation and discrimination
against members of minority groups.

The return of displaced persons and refugees is of
fundamental importance, and we must all redouble our
efforts to make that possible.
Furthermore, the Provisional Institutions of Self-
Government have yet to prove that they are capable of
functioning normally and of being genuinely
representative and responsible. They must devote
themselves exclusively to the management and
administration of matters under their competency -
matters that affect all the people of Kosovo.

Spain views with great concern the attitude ofthe
Kosovo Albanian leaders, who are publicly promoting,
on an ongoing basis, positions that run counter to
resolution 1244 (1999). All of the communities of
Kosovo must participate actively in the provisional and
municipal institutions. Lack of participation in those
institutions will prevent progress on concrete issues of
public administration and will do nothing to improve
Kosovo's international image. We condemn any
attempt to create mono-ethnic institutions, and we
appeal for the dismantling of the parallel administrative
structures that are still in operation.

Lastly, we emphasize the need to implement the
initiative of the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General to maintain a dialogue on practical
issues between the Belgrade authorities and the Kosovo
Provisional Institutions, in the framework of resolution
1244 (1999).
