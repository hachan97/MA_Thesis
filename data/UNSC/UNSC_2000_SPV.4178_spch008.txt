Sir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): The
representative of France will shortly be making a
statement on behalf of the European Union, which my
delegation naturally endorses, and I would thus just
like to confine myself to two or three very brief points.

First, Madam President, I would like, through
you, to thank Professor Gambari, Under-Secretary-
General and Special Adviser on Africa, for his very
useful introduction to our debate today.

My delegation is concerned at the continuing
appalling human rights situation in Angola and
particularly the humanitarian crisis which is resulting
from the conflict. We welcome the latest initiative by
civil society of a peace conference, which was held in
Angola from 18 to 21 July. As Professor Gambari said
in his introduction, military force is not the way
forward. Reconciliation and peaceful dialogue is the
only way ahead for Angola.

My delegation also welcomes the imminent
appointment of the new head of the United Nations
Office in Angola. We hope that the Office will now be
able to recruit the necessary staff to move quickly
towards full strength and to fulfil its mandate.

Finally, I would like to conclude with a somewhat
cryptic remark, and I hope that the members of the
Council will understand why I cannot be more specific.

The Minister of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs of the British Government,
Mr. Peter Hain, will be making an important statement
to the British House of Commons today on UNITA's
continuing sale of diamonds and on breaches of the
arms embargo. My delegation will ensure that a copy
of the Hansard record of this statement is circulated as
soon as possible to all members of the sanctions
Committee.
