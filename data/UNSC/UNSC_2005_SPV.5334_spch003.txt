The President: On our collective behalf, may I
thank Mr. Mwakawago for his briefing, for a very
positive report on the situation in Sierra Leone. And
may I, on behalf of the Council, at this particular stage
of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone, thank
him and his team for what they have actually been
doing on the ground. In particular - let me be quite
clear - those of us who visited Mr. Mwakawago in
Freetown in June 2004 understand exactly what it was
he was achieving on the ground.

Now, as was agreed in prior consultations, I
propose, under rule 33, that we suspend this meeting.

As I hear no objections, the meeting is
suspended.

The meeting was suspended at 11.30 am. and
resumed at 11.40 am.
