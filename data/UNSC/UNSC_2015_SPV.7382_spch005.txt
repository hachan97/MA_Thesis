Mr. Safronkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation supported the
adoption today of resolution 2201 (2015), which
encourages all parties in Yemen to pursue dialogue,
intensify their efforts to resolve the political crisis,
and strive to implement the arrangements reached in
the context of the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative
and Implementation Mechanism and the outcomes of
the National Dialogue Conference and the Peace and
National Partnership Agreement. The resolution urges
all parties to agree upon and announce publicly dates
for completing the constitutional consultation process,
to hold a referendum on the constitution, and to conduct
elections.

It is clear that the use of unilateral force will be
counterproductive to efforts to advance the political
process and only further exacerbate the crisis. Such
actions must be avoided, as categorically demanded
in the resolution, which gives them due attention.
We support the steps taken by the parties, with the
assistence of the Special Adviser of the Secretary-
General, Mr. Benomar, to find a formula for a long-
term and sustainable settlement in Yemen that would
meet the interests of all the inhabitants of the country. It
is important that the parties honour their commitments
under the agreements reached.
The Russian Federation insists that the leading
political forces in Yemen pursue constructive dialogue
on the internal political agenda and on issues related
to drafting a formula for State governance. That is
particularly relevant in the light of the growing terrorist
threat to the region, the country and the territorial
integrity of Yemen.
