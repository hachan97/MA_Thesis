Mr. Quinlan (Australia): I will be very brief,
knowing how busy the programme is. I would just like
to thank Council members for their contributions this
morning and for the warm welcome they have given
to the Australian chairmanship. At this stage, I would
also like to thank my predecessor and acknowledge his
contribution, Ambassador Nestor Osorio, who is now
President of the Economic and Social Council.

Since this is my first report to the Council, I would
like to emphasize that we are very conscious of the
responsibilities we have as Chair and the need to work
impartially and objectively to secure evidence and to
ensure that we are very professional about that. In that
regard, I would like to recognize the contribution of
the Panel of Experts. They are clearly an indispensable
professional platform for our work. I would also like
to express my appreciation for the very professional
support of the Secretariat.

We need, and we see, an organic working
relationship among the Committee established pursuant
to resolution 1737 (2006), the Panel and the Secretariat.
The Committee is just finalizing a programme of work
for the next little while, which covers its obligations
on compliance, investigations, outreach, dialogue,
assistance and cooperation. I think that we have made
a good start. I would like to thank Committee members
for that. The Committee next meets on 15 March.

Finally, some Council members have raised the
issue of the transparency of the Committee's work
and, like my predecessor, Ambassador Osorio, I would
like to provide forums where the Committee and Panel
members can engage with the broader United Nations
membership. We will work with the Committee
members to make arrangements for a briefing in the
coming months.
