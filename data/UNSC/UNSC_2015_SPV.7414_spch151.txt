Mr. Yaremenko (Ukraine): I would like to reply
to the comments by my Russian colleague, and will do
so in Russian in order to deliver my statement clearly.
(spoke in Russian)

In the information war that has been launched by
the Russian Federation against Ukraine, my country,
has been using the only "weapon" available to it, and
we are using for defensive purposes. We are simply
telling the truth. There is one concept in international
relations that seems to me to be a key one, and that is
trust. It is extremely difficult to build trust, but it is
also extremely easy to destroy it. I would like to recall
to all those here that not so long ago, Russia produced
a documentary film, Crimea, Road to the Motherland,
and the President of Russia, Mr. Putin, explained in
detail the special operation by means of which Russia
was going to annex a part of Ukrainian territory. I am
referring to the autonomous territory of Crimea.

IfI am not mistaken, this is the fourth Russian
version issued by the head of the Russian State about the
events that took place a year ago. I would like to recall
that there were no Russian military forces in Crimea
at the time of the events. The bases housing Ukrainian
forces, Ukrainian administrative buildings, ships of

the Ukrainian fleet and Ukrainian infrastructure were
seized by armed militias.

I believe that after such a permanent change in
the position of the Russian Federation, comments on
its statements are hardly necessary. What I would like
to re-emphasize is that, if what happened a year ago
had not happened, we would not be discussing the
problems of children in specific areas of the Donetsk
and Luhansk regions.
