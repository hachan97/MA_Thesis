The President (spoke in French): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Dmitry Titov,
Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping
Operations.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Titov to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the

At this meeting, the Council will hear a briefing
by Mr. Dmitry Titov, to whom I give the floor.
