Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China supports the draft resolution proposed by the
Arab group, so we cast an affirmative vote. However,
we deeply regret that it was not adopted. China's
position on the Middle East is clear and consistent. We
believe that, as the core body for preserving
international peace and security, the Security Council
should bear responsibility for protecting the safety and
security of civilians in the Gaza Strip. We are
consistently of the View that, to achieve Middle East
peace, negotiation is the only way, rather than the use
of force. We once again urge the parties concerned to
resume dialogue and return to political negotiations.
