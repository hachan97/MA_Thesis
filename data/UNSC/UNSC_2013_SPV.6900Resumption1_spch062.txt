Mr. Mottaghi Nejad (Islamic Republic of Iran): I
know it is late and that we have had a long day debating
important issues related to our joint efforts to combat
terrorism. However, I have asked for the floor to make a
brief reply to two statements made during the course of
this debate, by the representatives of the Israeli regime
and Canada, in the course of which allegations were
made against my country.

With reference to what was said by the representative
of the Zionist regime, it is not really my delegation's
intention to comment on such a rambling statement.
That regime is responsible for so many terrorist acts and
crimes that it would exceed the patience of this meeting
for me even to enumerate them. State terrorism, the
assassination ofIranian nuclear scientists, sabotage and
cyber attacks are just a few examples of that.

With regard to what was said by the representative

of Canada and the allegations raised against the Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps, I should say that, while
my delegation categorically rejects such baseless and
malicious allegations against an important segment of
the Iranian defence forces, it is a pity that Canada, based
on its narrow-minded foreign policy, once again used
this body to show its animosity towards Iran. Raising
such unfounded and baseless allegations against my
country is yet another politically motivated attempt to
deviate from the main issues at hand that we should be
discussing in this body.

Iran is a victim ofterrorism and, surprisingly, some
of the main terrorist elements whose hands covered
in the blood of thousands of innocent Iranian have
been provided asylum in Canada. Not only is Canada
harbouring such elements, but it is also misusing
international organs, including this body, to hide the
true nature of its support for terrorism.

As today's debate in the Chamber has made clear,
the fight against terrorism should be non-selective and
universal in its scope and applicability.
