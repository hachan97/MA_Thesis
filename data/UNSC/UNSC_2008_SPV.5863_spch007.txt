Mr. Bellemare: I thank the representative of the
Russian Federation for his question. The first thing that
I would like to say is that the situation of the
individuals he referred to results from a decision that
was made by the Lebanese judicial authorities
according to Lebanese criminal law. It is not for me to
second-guess their decision. I have continued to
provide the Lebanese judicial authorities with all the
information we have, so that they can make their own
assessment on the continued detention.

I have discussed the matter with the Prosecutor
General of Lebanon; but the Council will understand
that I will not comment publicly on my discussion with
him. The Prosecutor General is the highest judicial
investigative authority in Lebanon, and he is my main
interlocutor. My relationship with him is based on
trust, and that trust is based on the confidentiality of
our discussions. I also understand, from recent media
reports, that the matter may soon be litigated before an
international tribunal, which is yet another reason for
me not to comment further.
