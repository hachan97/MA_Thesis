The President: I am exceedingly grateful to
colleagues for the forbearance with which they are
dealing with the totalitarian regime in the Chair by
respecting the three- minute limit.

In terms of the way ahead, there are now four
speakers inscribed on my list. I have asked Mr. Roed-
Larsen if he would like to reply and pick up any points
in the debate, and he will do that afterwards. Then
there will be the traditional right of reply by the two
ambassadors who kicked off this debate, and, if they
want to take advantage of that, I should like - in
fairness, because the arguments have been well put,
especially by them - to restrict them also to no more
than three minutes in any concluding remarks that they
may wish to make. That will permit the Council to
respect a timetable of 5.30 for informal consultations to
begin.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Tunisia. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
