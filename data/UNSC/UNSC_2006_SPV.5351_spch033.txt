Mr. Hasegawa: In view of the brief time
available, I will respond to just two issues that have
been raised by the members of the Security Council
and other interested countries.

The first is that of pursuing justice and
reconciliation. Ambassador Faaborg-Andersen of
Denmark started the discussion by referring to the need
to pursue that subject, and it was touched upon by the
representatives of France, Greece, Japan, the United
States, Austria on behalf of the European Union,
Portugal and Brazil.

We have indeed taken note of the request made to
the Secretary-General by the President of the Security
Council in his letter of 28 September 2005 to formulate
a report on justice and reconciliation, with particular
emphasis on comments made by the Commission of
Experts, and on the need to produce a practical and
feasible approach, taking into account the views of
Timor-Leste and Indonesia.
Secondly, a number of speakers touched upon the
continued need for assistance in the period after the
United Nations Office in Timor-Leste. The
representatives of Argentina, Greece, Portugal, Brazil,
China, Ghana, Peru and Russia all spoke in favour of
providing continued international assistance, with
emphasis on the transfer of responsibilities, as much as
possible, to a sustainable assistance framework. At the
same time, many speakers referred to the need for
continued United Nations engagement in support of
preparations for the presidential and parliamentary
elections to be held in 2007. I have taken note of those
statements, and in particular of the requests made by
Ambassador Thomson of the United Kingdom for a
clearly defined role for the United Nations special
office and by Ambassador Oshima of Japan for the
modalities of the United Nations assistance to be
provided.
