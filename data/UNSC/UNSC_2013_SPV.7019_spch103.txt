Mr. Falouh (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): I apologize for taking the floor once again. I
simply wanted to respond to what the representative of
the Israeli occupation said.

In fact, the instability and the emergence of wars
in the Middle East region is a direct consequence of
the aggressive policy of Israel. Everyone knows that
Israeli aggression has been documented by numerous
international organizations. Israel has a long tally of
massacres and acts of aggression. That has lasted for
more than 60 years throughout the Arab territories.
Israel's State terrorism has resulted in horrific
massacres in Palestine, the Syrian Golan Heights and
Lebanon.

The representative of the occupation pretends to
have pity for the Syrian situation. However, he overlooks
the fact that the Syrian Golan is still occupied by Israel
and that its inhabitants are subject to assassinations.

Israel would not be able to continue in this
international organization without the protection of
those who sponsor it.
