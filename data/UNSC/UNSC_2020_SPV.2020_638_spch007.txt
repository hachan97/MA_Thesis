The United Kingdom expresses its thanks to the French and Tunisian delegations for their tireless patience over many months in taking forward resolution 2532 (2020). We commend them for their ingenuity and flexibility in proposing the necessary compromises to allow for its adoption today. The United Kingdom strongly supports the central demand in the resolution for a general and immediate cessation of hostilities. As is stressed in the resolution, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had a devastating impact across the world, especially in countries ravaged by armed conflicts or affected by humanitarian crises. We particularly welcome the acknowledgement in the resolution of the critical role that women are playing in COVID-19 response efforts. While we are pleased that Council members have been able to adopt the resolution, the Council's delay in adopting the resolution since the Secretary-General 23 March ceasefire call is deeply disappointing. We must delay no longer. We call on all parties to conflict to act on this resolution, for the sake of their own peoples and so the world can best defeat COVID-19. The Council should now hold such parties to account if they fail to cease hostilities or permit humanitarian access. We look forward to the Secretary-General's updates to the Council and thank him for his leadership on this issue.
