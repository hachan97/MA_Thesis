Mr. Kuzmin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation is opposed to holding
today's meeting, as we immediately informed our
colleagues on Friday, 16 March. We see no justification
for such a meeting, since human rights is not a subject
on the Security Council's agenda. That is what the
Human Rights Council deals with in its work in
Geneva. The mere presence of Mr. Ra'ad Hussein in
New York is not a convincing reason for him to brief
the Security Council.

However, as I understand it, the French delegation,
along with a number of others, has already explained
the real reasons behind today's meeting. They want to
hear about how the Syrian regime, as they refer to it,
is violating the rights of its own people. I note once
again that their subject is that infamous regime, rather
than the extremists whom they openly support and who
have been terrorizing the people of Syria for eight years
now. That only confirms our fears about the deeply
politicized nature of this initiative, which has nothing
to do with concern for the Syrians.

We would also like to ask the Secretariat to explain
the reason for circulating to delegations a note on
human rights in Syria from the Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, despite
the fact that we did not request that information. The
United Nations system is not organized so that any
United Nations body can send the Security Council any
information it feels like. We believe that the Secretariat
blindly obeyed the delegations that decided to hold this
briefing, in violation of the division of labour among
the main organs of our Organization, as enshrined in
the Charter of the United Nations. In the circumstances,
we believe it essential to cancel the meeting and we are
therefore obliged to ask the President to put the issue to
a procedural vote.
