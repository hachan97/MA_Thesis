Mr. Geng Shuang (China) (spoke in Chinese): The situation in Libya has seen positive momentum recently. However, the overall situation remains delicate and fragile. At this critical moment, China, together with others in the international community, supports the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) in pursuing the implementation of its mandate. China thanks the United Kingdom for its efforts as penholder in facilitating the renewal of the UNSMIL mandate. Regrettably, however, issues relating to human rights, gender and ceasefire monitoring, inter alia, were not properly resolved in the resolution, which is why there is still room for improvement. China's proposalto mandate UNSMIL toassist Libya in advancing in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the proposal of other members to offer ceasefire-monitoring arrangements should be agreed on by the parties concerned. Neither of these issues has been duly reflected in the resolution. As a result, China had no choice but to abstain in the voting. We hope that, at the next consultations on the draft resolution on UNSMIL mandate renewal, the opinions of all parties will be heeded more fully and their concerns better accommodated in order to strive to reach consensus. Last but not least, I would like to reiterate that China will continue to play a constructive role in achieving lasting peace and sustainable development in Libya at an early date.
