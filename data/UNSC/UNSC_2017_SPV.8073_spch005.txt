Mr. Llorentty Soliz (Plurinational State ofBolivia) (spoke in Spanish): Bolivia is taking the floor because
of our concern that it is very possible that, today in
the United Nations, the Security Council will send a
completely negative signal to the world.

We agree with the proposal made by the Russian
Federation because we believe that the Security Council
must remain united and unanimous in its fight against
the use of chemical weapons. We deplore the fact that
proposals are presented in the full knowledge that they
will be vetoed and opposed, and deliberately without
providing the time necessary to reach the consensus
and unity that Security Council has demonstrated on so
many occasions.

For that reason, Bolivia expresses its support for
the proposal of the Russian Federation to postpone the
voting on the draft resolution before us.
