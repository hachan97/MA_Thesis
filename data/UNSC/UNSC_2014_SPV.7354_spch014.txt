Mrs. Jakubone (Lithuania): It is with regret that
Lithuania had to abstain in the voting on draft resolution
S/2014/916 before the Council today. Our vote should
not be understood as an abstention on the solution itself.
On the contrary, most elements of the draft resolution
constitute a good basis for further collective work in
establishing parameters for peace negotiations seeking
an agreed and peaceful settlement of Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.

We would like to make it clear that there is no
substitute for direct talks between the parties, and
we call for an immediate resumption of negotiations.
It is through negotiations that a final, just, fair and
agreed settlement of the conflict can be achieved. It is
through negotiations that a realization of the two-State
solution can become a reality in which Israel and an
independent, democratic, contiguous, sovereign and
viable Palestine live side by side in peace, security and
mutual recognition.

Furthermore, a resumption of negotiations is a
matter of urgency. The unsustainable situation in
Gaza, the recent increase of violence in Jerusalem and
the West Bank, and the deteriorating regional context
underline the need for a comprehensive peace, ending
all claims and fulfilling the legitimate aspirations of
both parties, including those of Israelis to security and
those of Palestinians to statehood. People on both sides,
along with the international community, expect their
leaders to show real leadership by taking responsible,
pragmatic and bold action to guarantee their security

and prosperous future. Any unilateral action is
detrimental to a resumption of peace negotiations, and
consequently to a final and peaceful settlement of the
conflict.
