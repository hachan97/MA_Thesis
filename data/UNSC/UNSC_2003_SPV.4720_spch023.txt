Mr. Chambas: I will talk about the national
commissions, and Mr. Sall will address the issues
regarding the technical difficulties, the implementation
and some of the requirements for more effective
implementation.

A major part of the problem, of course, is the lack
of information on or ignorance about this particular
problem that plagues our subregion. The role of
national commissions is, among other things, of course,
to bring greater awareness to the various countries and
their populations and to sensitize our peoples to the
dangers of small arms and mercenaries. As we have
been informed, 13 of our member States now indeed
have national commissions, and the role of these
commissions will be to begin work effectively to, first
of all, ensure that member States incorporate the
Moratorium in their laws. By this, I mean the
Moratorium that they have agreed to - that these laws
from the subregional level and at the various national
levels are incorporated into national laws, that the
various security agencies, armed forces, police and
other security apparatus become an active part of the
implementation of the Moratorium. At the national
level, the laws have to move on to provincial or
regional levels, and down to the local levels. I think the
example of Mali that was cited here, where this kind of
decentralization has taken place, obviously needs to be
encouraged and promoted, so that people should be
sensitized down to the local grass-roots level as to what
it is that needs to be done to curtail the activities of
mercenaries and to reduce the spread - if not totally
eliminate- these weapons which continue to be a
threat to the peace and stability of West Africa.
