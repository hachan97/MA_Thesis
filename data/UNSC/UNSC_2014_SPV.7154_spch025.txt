Mr. Sergeyev (Ukraine): Several issues were
raised by our Russian colleague. I would like to answer
just one.
(spoke in Russian)

First, Mr. Churkin compared the situation in
December and January with the current situation. We
must recall that, at that time, the people were speaking
out against the banditry of the authorities, and now it is
bandits who are against the people. There is a difference
there.

We cannot remain calm about the fact that several
hundred separatists are holding thousands of people
hostage to fear in towns. We see the standoffs on
television in Kharkiv, Luhansk and Dnipropetrovsk.
We cannot look on while small groups of armed people,
headed up, inter alia, by agents from the Russian
Federation, seize State buildings and take weapons
to hand out. Indeed, those are terrorist operations
that have been specially organized and orchestrated.
Mr. Churkin is absolutely right, there is not much time
left at all, there is just about an hour and a half. It is
just as easy for him to call his President and say a few
simple things to him as it is for me to do so, so I will
repeat them here. The statement that Mr. Churkin has
referred very negatively to several times today was
made by the acting President, Mr. Turchynov, and was
addressed to those people who are now creating tension
in those towns, the terrorist groups of separatists. He
stated:

(spoke in English)

"Those not involved in shooting at Ukrainian law
enforcement officers and who will surrender their
weapons and leave State administrative buildings
will be released from prosecution."

(spoke in Russian)

Why do they not call their people and tell them to
come back, sit down around the negotiating table and
decide together how we can establish good neighbourly
relations? That would be the right thing to do. The
Government mentioned the referendum, changes to
the Constitution, the retention of the language law
and the fact that the problems that have cropped up
over the decades and remained unsolved by previous
Governments needed to be addressed at last. That is
something that we need to do, but we are being prevented
from doing so. I would like Mr. Churkin to listen to that
and convey what he can to his Government.

(spoke in English)

I am sincerely thankful to the members of the
Security Council who spoke in favour of a peaceful
resolution of the problems in Ukraine. I am sincerely
thankful for that. I also thank the members of the
Security Council for understanding the critical situation
in Ukraine and for any kind of support they can provide.
