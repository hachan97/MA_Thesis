Mr. Cai Weiming (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
thank Ms. Bensouda for her briefing.

At present, the National Assembly and interim
Government are committedto Libya's political transition
and economic reconstruction, where progress has been
registered. The recent successful election put in place
the new Prime Minister of the interim Government. At
the same time, the political situation remains unstable,
conomic recovery is sluggish, the security situation
remains fragile and violence continues unabated. On
the whole, the situation is increasingly worrisome.

China respects the will and choice of the Libyan

people. We hope that all of the Libyan parties will bear
in mind the interests of the country and its people in
resolving their differences through political dialogue
and address the various challenges of the transition
period, in order to achieve long-term security and
stability. China welcomes the interim Government's
efforts to achieve justice.

On the question of international judicial organs,
China's position remains unchanged. We are of the
view that the international judicial organs should
fully respect the judicial sovereignty of the countries
concerned and abide by the norms of international
relations. In exercising jurisdiction, they must comply
with the principle of complementarity and cannot
replace the role played by national judicial systems. It is
China's hope that the international judicial organs will
act in accordance with the relevant Council resolutions
and facilitate Libya's reconstruction and political
transition.
