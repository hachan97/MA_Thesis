Ms. Sison (United States of America): Today,
the Council came together on an issue of critical
importance. Our adoption today of resolution 2393
(2017) enables the United Nations to continue to provide
vital, lifesaving cross-border assistance to millions of
Syrians who need it to survive. Thanks to its mandate,
more than 1 million Syrians receive assistance from
the United Nations and its partners every month. This
includes clean drinking water, medicine and food. Since
resolution 2165 (2014) was first adopted in 2014, nearly
17,000 trucks delivering aid have rolled into Syria.
Each of those trucks was fully vetted by the dedicated
United Nations monitoring mechanism. It is no
exaggeration to say that this cross-border authorization
for humanitarian assistance has saved lives in Syria. We
reaffirm our commitment to supporting the delivery of
cross-line and cross-border humanitarian assistance to
the Syrian people.

While the unfettered provision of cross-border
assistance is crucial to reducing the suffering in Syria,
it is no substitute for a political solution to the conflict.
The United States remains committed to resolution 2254
(2015) as the sole legitimate blueprint for a political
resolution to this conflict. We call on all the parties
to reaffirm support for the Geneva process as the only
framework for a viable Syrian political process.

The United States was proud to vote in favour of
resolution 2393 (2017) today, and we will continue
our robust support to the people of Syria in the days
to come.
