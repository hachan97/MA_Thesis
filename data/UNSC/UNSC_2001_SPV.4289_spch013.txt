Mr. Cherif (Tunisia) (spoke in French): I would
like to welcome Mr. Kerim, the Minister for Foreign
Affairs of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
His presence among us demonstrates the importance of
the question under consideration today. Indeed, the
violence on the border of Kosovo is threatening the
stability and ethnic balance of the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia. Furthermore, this violence is
in danger of destabilizing the region as a whole and of
compromising the efforts made to date by the
international community.

We strongly condemn the attacks perpetrated
against the army of the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, which have resulted in the death of
soldiers. We believe that such acts of violence must be
brought to an end throughout the entire region,
especially in the border areas. We reaffirm the
territorial integrity and sovereignty of the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the right of its
people to a peaceful life within its borders. In this
regard, we welcome the border demarcation agreement
of 23 February signed in Skopje between the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia and the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia. We urge the Kosovo Force to
make further efforts in order to halt the crisis and to
prevent it from spreading throughout the region
creating new hotbeds of tension.

Furthermore, we believe that it is essential to deal
with the root causes of violence in the region,
especially the economic and social causes, and to take
adequate steps for the restoration of lasting peace in the
region. We are convinced that the settlement of all
disputes through peaceful means and dialogue might
help the parties to embark upon the path of lasting
ethnic reconciliation.
