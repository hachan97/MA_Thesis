The President: I thank the representative of Saudi
Arabia for his gracious remarks about me. I would
also like to take this opportunity to thank all Council
members, and other Members of the United Nations, who
in their speeches today expressed their solidarity with
Pakistan and conveyed their condolences to us in this
moment of national tragedy, when we became victims
of terrorism. We appreciate their vocal expressions of
solidarity with Pakistan.
I now give the floor to the representative of Turkey,
who wishes to make an additional statement.
