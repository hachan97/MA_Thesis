Mr. Espinosa (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish):
With its vote in favour, my delegation contributed to the
adoption of the resolution introduced by three African
States that are members of the Security Council. From the
beginning, we expressed our alarm at and condemnation
of the treacherous assassination attempt against President
Mubarak of Egypt. With this resolution, the Council sends
a clear signal that Sudan must respond to the requests
contained in paragraph 4 of resolution 1044 (1996) and
reaffirmed in resolution 1054 (1996). Like France, we
view these provisions as incentives and not as
punishment. We believe the resolution provides a
reasonable grace period for the adoption of the measures
necessary to meet the requirements of the Council in this
matter.

This is not a resolution of immediate effect. In due
course, when the time limit provided for in operative
paragraph 4 has elapsed, we will have an opportunity to
properly assess the situation and its developments. We
express our hope that this assessment will make it
unnecessary for us to take further measures. To this end,
we will be paying attention to everything that occurs, to
all information the Secretary-General can provide us and
to information from any other relevant source. And if,
regrettably, it turns out that measures have to be adopted,
we will see to it that in their application account is taken
of their possible humanitarian implications inter alia.
Should sanctions have to be implemented, we are
interested in ensuring that they do not bring harm to the
Sudanese people. In the view of my country, to the extent
possible we must avoid creating innocent victims in the
fight against terrorism.
