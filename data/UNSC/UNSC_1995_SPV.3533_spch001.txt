The President (interpretation from French): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them document
S/1995/373, which contains the text of a draft resolution
prepared in the course of the Council's prior consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to document S/1995/372, which contains the
text of a letter dated 8 May 1995 from the Chairman of the
Security Council Committee established pursuant to
resolution 724 (1991) concerning Yugoslavia addressed to
the President of the Security Council.

It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before
it. If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft resolution to
the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Argentina, Botswana, China, Czech Republic,
France, Germany, Honduras, Indonesia, Italy,
Nigeria, Oman, Russian Federation, Rwanda, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America

The President (interpretation from French): There
were 15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been

adopted unanimously as resolution 992 (1995).

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.

The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 3.45 pm.
