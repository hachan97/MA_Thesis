Mr. Duale (Somalia): I thank you, Mr. President,
for having convened this meeting on Somalia and, in
particular, on the assessment report on which we have
just been briefed (see S/2013/239, annex).

I thank the Council for inviting me to address it
today. I also thank the Under-Secretary-General for his
briefing. On behalf of my Government, I also thank the
assessment team that prepared the report. It is one of
the best reports I have ever seen. It is clear, it is factual,
and it prescribes the medicine Somalia needs right now
to get out of the predicament that it is in.

I also thank the African Union Mission in Somalia
(AMISOM) and the Governments of countries that have
saved us from Al-Shabaab, in particular our brothers
and sisters from Africa. AMISOM. has done a goodjob,
and I believe it is now time to ensure that the Somali
National Security Forces are able in due course to take
over the responsibilities of clearing Al-Shabaab out of
all parts of Somalia, thereby providing stability and
security for the country.

I would also take this opportunity to express my
sincere appreciation for our brother, the Minister for
Foreign Affairs of Ethiopia, who is here with us. This
is the first time I have met him, and I am honoured to
do so.

I believe that Somalia has passed through many
stages. We are now at a time when we can see the light
at the end of the tunnel. We hope that the contents of
the report will be realized through the full support
of the Security Council, and the sooner, the better.
Furthermore, I believe that most of the findings and
recommendations on the many issues in the report
are consonant with what our President set forth in
his six-pillar policy as soon as he was elected. The
report therefore is very much in accord with what the
Government of Somalia believes in and wishes to see
realized as soon as possible.

I thank the Security Council and the members of the
Council who asked the Secretary-General to undertake
the assessment.
