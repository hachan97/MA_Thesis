The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank
Mr. Egeland for his very important briefing. Once
again, I wish him every success for the future.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members in prior consultations, I
remind all speakers to limit their statements to no more
than five minutes in order to enable the Council to
carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with
lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate the
texts of their statements in writing and to deliver a
condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.

I shall now give the floor to the members of the
Council.
