Mr. Zhang Dianbin (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China wishes to begin by congratulating Kuwait on its
successful stewardship of the Security Council's work
as rotating President for June. Thanks to the efforts
of Ambassador Alotaibi and everyone in the Kuwaiti
Mission, this month the Council's work has been
orderly and highly efficient, which China appreciates.
On behalf of Ambassador Ma Zhaoxu, I also extend our
sincere greetings to Ambassador Delattre and thank
him for his contributions to the Council's work. I also
wish him every success.

As we speak, the peace process in Mali is
at a critical juncture, facing security, economic,
development and other challenges, and requires the
active assistance of the international community. The
smooth renewal of the mandate of the United Nations
Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission
in Mali (MINUSMA), with the current strength
unchanged, can facilitate the ongoing efforts of the
United Nations and the international community to
continue to help the Malian Government and people
in advancing the implementation of the Agreement
on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali and in bolstering
its security capacities. We are keen that MINUSMA
should fully implement the Council's mandates and
strengthen measures to increase the protection of the
safety and security of its peacekeepers.

As the situation in Mali is closely linked to that
of its neighbours and the Sahel region, we hope that
MINUSMA can continue to support the Joint Force of
the Group of Five for the Sahel in accordance with the
Council's resolutions.
China is ready to join the other Council members
and the international community in contributing to
peace, stability and development in Mali.
