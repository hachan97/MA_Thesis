The President: I thank the Secretary-General for his
important statement and for his kind words addressed to
me and to the Government of Bangladesh. Mr. Secretary-
General, you have talked about the humanitarian dilemma.
The purpose of our debate today, as I have outlined, is to
address this dilemma. I am sure that what you have said
about concrete actions will be heard around the world.
