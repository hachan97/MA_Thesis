The President: Thank you very much for your
very kind words. Again, I hope that the atmosphere that
we have had here today will prevail during the round
table meeting. This has to be translated into pledges,
and pledges have to be translated into disbursement.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded its
business for this meeting.

The Security Council will reconvene immediately
to continue its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 5p.m.
