Mr. Ibrahim (Malaysia): With regard to resolution
2220 (2015), which the Council has just adopted,
Malaysia places high hopes on the Council being
able to reach consensus on this important issue. The
statement that you made before the voting, Madam
President, clearly amplified why this resolution is
needed. However, we also recognize that Council
members will have to redouble their efforts to further
refine an approach that can take the parameters of
this technical issue into consideration. Malaysia was
pleased to participate in our constructive discussions,
and we would like to congratulate Lithuania and you
personally, Madam President, for your leadership in
our collective endeavour.
