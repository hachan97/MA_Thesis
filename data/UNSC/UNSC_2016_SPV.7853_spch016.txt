Mr. Martins (Angola): Angola welcomes the
adoption today of resolution 2334 (2016). I would
like to thank the sponsors - Egypt, Malaysia, New
Zealand, Senegal and Venezuel - for presenting it to
the Council.

For far too long, a source of deep frustration and
despair to the international community as a whole has
been the continued expansion of illegal settlements
by the Israeli authorities, which have perpetuated an
atmosphere of mistrust, hostility and violence among
Israelis and Palestinians. There is no doubt that the
settlements are illegal under international law, and
therefore we find it disappointing that the Israeli
authorities dispute that and believe that their final status
should be determined in talks on Palestinian statehood.

Palestinian statehood will not be possible if
settlements are expanded; then any possibility of a
contiguous Palestinian State would be eliminated.
Therefore, we urge both parties to refrain from any
negative unilateral actions that could hinder the
prospect of the two States living side by side in peace
and harmony.

A Council resolution represents only a positive
contribution to peace and security in the world, which
again is the primary raison d'etre of the Council; that
is, if the resolution can be implemented. I hope that
resolution 2334 (2016), which we just adopted, will
be effectively implemented, particularly by all key
parties. This calls for the unity of the Security Council,
unity by the Palestinians, unity in Israel. Above all,
resolution 2334 (2016) calls for a commitment to
peace, particularly by the two main parties, Israel
and Palestine.

In conclusion, let me say that the resolution is not
an imposition of terms by the United Nations, but rather
a measure to salvage the prospects of the two-State
solution. Therefore, we hope that we will definitely see
this as a step in the right direction, as we have several
times reiterated in the Council.
