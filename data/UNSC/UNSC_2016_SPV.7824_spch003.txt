The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Mr. Ladsous for his briefing.

I wish to remind all speakers to limit their
statements to no more than five minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
To that end, let me take this opportunity to remind
speakers that the presidency will use the flashing lights
on the collars of the microphones to prompt speakers to
bring their remarks to a close. Delegations with lengthy
statements are kindly requested to circulate the texts
in writing and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking in the Chamber.

I now give the floor to Mr. Thoresson.
