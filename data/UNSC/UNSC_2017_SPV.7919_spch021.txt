Mr. Safronkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I take the floor again only to say that I would
like to ask the representatives of the United States and
other countries not to insult my country. They have
absolutely no moral right to do so. We do not behave in
that way ourselves.

I would simply like to say that Ambassador Haley,
who has only just taken up her post here, has a real
chance, both as Permanent Representative of the United
States and as the current President of the Security
Council, to restore the collective work of the Security
Council to a healthy state. But that will not happen if
she claims a national point of view to be an absolute
truth. We would first like to ensure that our work in the
Council is mutually respectful.

The meeting rose at 1.30pm.
