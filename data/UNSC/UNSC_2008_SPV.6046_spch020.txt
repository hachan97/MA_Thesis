Mr. Arias (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): First of
all, Sir, allow me to thank you for having convened this
important meeting on Somalia and the piracy that
affects its coast and international peace and security.
For that reason, Panama supported the resolution
adopted by the Security Council, while remaining
aware of its scope and that the international community
must ensure that it is implemented fully in accordance
with international law.

Somalia is more than an untamed coast. It is a
country whose citizens barely survive amid the most
abject poverty, caused by years of wars, drought and
political uncertainty. There is no doubt that the piracy
that it is currently suffering is a symptom, and not a
cause, of the insecurity of Somalia.

For that reason, the international community must
use all means available to it to achieve peace and
stability in Somalia. Until the United Nations
establishes the most appropriate mechanisms to address
the situation, Panama repeats that it is essential that
this Organization, and not simply a few countries in
particular, support the efforts of the African Union
Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). Currently, AMISOM
is the only hope for bringing peace, stability and
development to the people of Somalia.

Finally, Panama is grateful for the commitment of
a number of States Members of this Organization and
regional organizations to undertake operations along
the Somali coast with a view to combating the acts of
piracy, which are affecting the region and the entire
world.
