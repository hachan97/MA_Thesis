Mr. Arias (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): First of
all, allow me to express my gratitude for the briefings
that were given to us by Under-Secretary-General
Pascoe and Assistant Secretary-General Mulet.

Panama has listened very closely and with great
concern to the views expressed in this Chamber over
the past few days by the Permanent Representative of
the Republic of Georgia and by the Permanent
Representative of the Russian Federation and other
members of the Council.

Regarding this matter, Panama would like to state
that we are concerned by and condemn the decision
taken by the Georgian Government to seek to impose
its authority over South Ossetia through the use of
force. Panama is also concerned by and condemns the
entirely disproportionate, and therefore illegitimate,
use of force by the Russian Federation with the stated
aim of protecting its citizens and peacekeeping forces.

Panama recalls that the right of self-defence
provided for in Article 51 of the Charter has some
basic restrictions, and any abuse of these by the
Russian Federation is a violation of its fiduciary
obligations as a permanent member of the Council.

Panama issues a call for the Council to
immediately express itself in favour of a cessation of
hostilities and a return to the status quo ante. The
Council should also support the diplomatic efforts
undertaken by a number of countries and international
organizations. Panama expresses its respect for the
territorial integrity of the Republic of Georgia, and also
wishes to recognize the right to self-determination of
the people of South Ossetia. Panama is aware of the
conflict between those two principles.
