Sir John Weston (United Kingdom): I shall be very
brief. The United Kingdom regrets that the decision of the
Government of Iraq not to export oil under Security
Council resolution 1111 (1997) until 13 August this year
has resulted in Iraq's being unable to take advantage of

the full quota provided for in the first 90-day period
under Security Council resolution l. I ll (1997). Unless the
Council was prepared to amend the provisions of Security
Council resolution 1111 (1997), this would mean less
revenue for the purchase of humanitarian supplies for the
Iraqi people. Through no fault of their own, the Iraqi
people would be denied the full allowance of
humanitarian supplies.

Let me be quite clear. The United Kingdom is
determined to ensure that the Iraqi people receive the
maximum benefit from Security Council resolution 111]
(1997). That is why the United Kingdom has taken the
initiative in putting forward and co-sponsoring this draft
resolution. It enables Iraq to make up the shortfall in oil.
sales and thus to ensure that the full amount of revenue
is made available for the purchase of humanitarian
supplies for the benefit of the Iraqi people.

'The United Kingdom hopes that from now on the
Government of Iraq will assume its full responsibilities
under resolution 986 (1995), resolution 1111 (1997) and
all other relevant resolutions of the Security Council.
