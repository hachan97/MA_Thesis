Mr. Al-Henzab (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): My
delegation voted in favour of resolution 1773 (2007),
which stresses the importance of the sovereignty and
political independence of Lebanon. Our position
respects the request from the Lebanese Government in
3
this connection. We reaffirm our consistent strong
support for all those working as part of the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), to which
Qatar is also contributing troops. My delegation hopes
that, with the adoption of the resolution, the parties
will respect their responsibilities in accordance with
the resolution in order to reach a permanent ceasefire.
We look forward to the Council shouldering its
responsibility to bring about stability and peace in the
region.
