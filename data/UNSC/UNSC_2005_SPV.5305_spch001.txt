The President (spoke in Russian): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Jean-Marc de La
Sabliere, head of the Security Council mission to
Central Africa and Permanent Representative of
France.

It is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

I should like to welcome the return of the
members of the Council and of the Secretariat who
took part in the mission to Central Africa.

I now give the floor to Mr. Jean-Marc de La
Sabliere, in his capacity as head of the Security
Council mission to Central Africa.
