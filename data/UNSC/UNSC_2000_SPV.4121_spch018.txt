Mr. Prendergast: Maybe I could pick out five points
from this very interesting discussion this morning. First of
all, I detected a very widespread view that there are solid
grounds for hope in Guinea-Bissau, notwithstanding
current economic and other problems. Secondly, there was
also very wide and strong support for the people of
Guinea-Bissau in the ongoing process of democratization
and good governance. Thirdly, I must say I very much
welcome the emphasis that was placed by speakers on the
importance of consolidating the democratic process and
on its essentially civilian nature. It was right to emphasize
that. Fourthly, I noted - and this was not in my own
introductory remarks - comments that correctly
emphasized the dangers that small arms pose to the
region, and therefore the importance of the arms-recovery
programme.

Lastly, let me say how much I welcome the
emphasis on post-conflict peace-building. The figure that
one has heard is that about 60 per cent conflicts slide
back into violence after settlements. This rather
melancholy figure illustrates the importance of not resting
on our oars once there has been a formal peace
agreement. A lot remains to be done, and there are always
Cinderella areas. And one of those, which I think is also
highly relevant to Guinea-Bissau, is the question of
demobilization and, particularly, reintegration into civilian
society. Resources are required for this process; often in
the past this has been placed on a voluntary basis, and it
tends to be something of a Cinderella. So again, I very
much thank those members of the Council who
emphasized that this is an ongoing task and that we need
to place more emphasis on post-conflict peace-building.
