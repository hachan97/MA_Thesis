The President: I thank the representative of
Sierra Leone for his kind words addressed to me.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Liberia. On behalf of
the Council, I extend a warm welcome to him and
invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to
make his statement.
