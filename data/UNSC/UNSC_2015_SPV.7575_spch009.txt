Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
has already expressed its position against discussion in
the Security Council of the human rights situation in
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. China is
always opposed to the Security Council's intervention
in issues that concern a country's human rights. The
Security Council is not the place to address human
rights issues. More important, human rights issues
should not be politicized.

Currently, the situation on the Korean peninsula
remains complicated and delicate. Maintaining peace
and stability on the peninsula, realizing the goal of
de-nuclearization on the peninsula and resolving
relevant issues through dialogue and consultation are in
the common interests of all the relevant parties. China
calls on all such parties to bear in mind the big picture
and to make greater efforts to de-escalate the tension
on the peninsula so as to promote dialogue and mutual
trust, rather than the contrary.

As a permanent member of the Security Council
and the host country of the Six-Party Talks, China has
for many years been actively promoting negotiation
and dialogue for peace and has made unremitting
efforts to maintain peace on the peninsula and achieve
de-nuclearization. We hope that all parties will work
with China to play a positive role in realizing the goals
of de-nuclearization on the peninsula and safeguarding
the common interests of all parties.
