Mr. Omaish (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): Jordan
expresses its deep regret over the criminal incident
that led to the downing of the Malaysia Airline aircraft
over eastern Ukraine yesterday. We also express our
deepest condolence to the Government of Malaysia and
to all the families of the victims who were killed in that
disastrous incident.

Jordan calls for an independent, full and
comprehensive investigation of yesterday's incident,
including the participation of the relevant Ukrainian
authorities and cooperation with other relevant
authorities, including the Malaysian authorities.

The Jordanian Government is gravely concerned
over the deteriorating situation in eastern Ukraine,
which has taken a new and very dangerous turn following
yesterday's events. Previously, Jordan expressed its
great concern for the deteriorating situation in eastern
Ukraine. We hereby reaffirm our call for all influential
parties in Ukraine to act in order to end the deterioration,
to exert pressure on the insurgents to disarm and to
withdraw from the facilities and buildings they are
occupying, and to find a peaceful solution to the crisis
in order to restore stability to eastern Ukraine. We also
call for a guarantee that the displaced people can return
to their homes as soon as possible.

Jordan urges all the parties to the Geneva statement
and the Berlin joint declaration to abide by their
provisions. We call upon all the relevant parties to
facilitate the work of the United Nations human rights
monitoring mission in Ukraine, especially in eastern
Ukraine.

Jordan reaffirms the importance of respecting the
sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine.

In conclusion, we urge the Ukrainian Government
to continue its efforts aimed at promoting the political
participation of all Ukrainians and ensuring the full
implementation of international conventions on human
rights while taking into consideration the concerns of
minorities and non-Ukranian speakers.
