Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): During his inauguration today, President
Zelensky spoke out specifically against attempts to
sow division in Ukrainian society based on language.
The fight against Russian language and culture and
the desire to destroy the all-embracing ties between
these two brother countries became the hallmark of the
outgoing Kyiv regime.

The Maidan authorities built their policies on a
total rejection of everything Russian and of everything
in common with Russia. They rejected our common
origin from a single ancient Russian root with
Kyiv as the mother of Russian cities, accused us of
stealing and usurping Ukrainian history, saying that
Ukrainians and Russians are in fact not brothers but
completely different peoples, that Ukraine lived for
centuries under occupation by Muscovy. They cursed
the Soviet regime, which, let me point out, created
Ukraine's current borders. We heard the deluded
theories of Ukrainian so-called historians about the
origins of the ancient Ukrs, who supposedly originated
45,000 years ago and are more ancient than all the
ancient civilizations - Sumerian, Egyptian, Cretan-
Mycenaean, Indic, Hellenic, Roman and more. When
we heard that we chuckled, assuming we were dealing
with nationalistic scum and borderline personalities.
Today a number of those ideas are official ideology and
historical and philosophical doctrine in Government
and social science institutions in Kyiv.

Some hasty decisions and statements in 2014 by
nationalist members of the Verkhovna Rada provoked
the centrifugal tendencies in Crimea, which led to
the referendum on reunification with Russia. And
the Maidan authorities' unwillingness to engage in
dialogue with the people of Donetsk and Luhansk,
whose appeals for a hearing were met with bullets and
shells, became the prime cause of the current civil war
in Donbas.
