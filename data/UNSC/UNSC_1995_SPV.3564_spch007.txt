Mr. ngowe (Botswana): My delegation is seriously
concerned by the reports that thousands of men and boys
of military age have today not been accounted for in
Bosnia and Herzegovina since the seizure of the enclaves
of Srebrenica by the Bosnian Serb forces. The situation is
further compounded by the fact that the Bosnian Serbs
continue to deny the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red
Cross access to the displaced persons in Srebrenica. It is
in the light of these concerns that my delegation will vote
in favour of the draft resolution before us.

We hope the Bosnian Serbs will heed the contents of
the draft resolution we are about to adopt. They must
understand that they have an obligation under
international law to facilitate the registration of all
persons they hold prisoner and to treat prisoners of war
in accordance with acceptable international standards. We
therefore call upon the Bosnian Serbs to give the
UNHCR, the ICRC and other international humanitarian
agencies immediate access to all the displaced persons
from Srebrenica and Zepa.
