Mr. Tumysh (Kazakhstan): My delegation thanks
President Agius, President Meron and Prosecutor
Brammertz for their updates.

Kazakhstan notes with satisfaction the progress
achieved over the past six months in the work of the
International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and
in the effective implementation of the strategy for the
Tribunal's closure, despite the continued serious issue of
staff attrition. We appreciate the leadership of President
Agius in his efforts to ensure the proper functioning
of the Tribunal under the difficult circumstances. We
hope that the various challenges encountered will not
be a setback in the Tribunal's timely completion of the
trials of the remaining pending cases. In addition, it
is imperative that effective solutions be found for the
existing administrative issues facing the Tribunal.

My delegation closely follows the work of the
International Residual Mechanism for Criminal
Tribunals and hopes that all efforts to assist the victims
of some of the most inhuman of crimes will be carried
out successfully.

We see the value of the significant role played by
the international judicial and quasi-judicial bodies
in preserving our faith in international law and in
inevitably punishing the perpetrators of serious crimes.
Kazakhstan commends the respect for and strict
adherence to the important principles of objectivity,
independence and impartiality that the Tribunal
followed in conducting its work.

Finally, my delegation would like to thank
Ambassador Elbio Rosselli, Chair of the Informal
Working Group on International Tribunals, and the
Permanent Mission of Uruguay for their tireless efforts
and diligent dedication to their duties on behalf of
the Council.
