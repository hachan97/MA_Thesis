Mr. Barros Melet (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): Chile
voted in favour of today's resolution 2220 (2015) in an
expression of my country's ongoing commitment to
disarmament in every form and to the fight against the
illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. We believe
the work of the Security Council can be enriched
through an ongoing dialogue on the impact of illicit
transfers of such weapons on international security and
on the foundation provided by the Arms Trade Treaty of
2013. The resolution we have just adopted marks a step
forward from the previous Security Council resolution
on the subject, resolution 2117 (2013). The text also
contains substantive language on women and peace and
security in line with resolution 1325 (2000) and other
related resolutions, and with article 7, paragraph 4, of
the Arms Trade Treaty, supported by Chile.

We regret the fact that the resolution does not include
a reference to the impact produced by illicit transfers
in arms and ammunition to non-State actors and
unauthorized groups. That issue should be addressed,
given the negative effects of the cross-border actions of
many non-State actors, which have major repercussions
for civilian populations and for international peace and
security.
