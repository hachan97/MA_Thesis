The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as the representative of Japan.

Japan's position on the Middle East peace process
remains clear and steadfast. Japan supports a two-State
solution and believes that the final status of Jerusalem
is part of a range of issues that should be resolved
through negotiations, based on the relevant Security
Council resolutions and previous agreements between
the parties. With that in mind, Japan voted in favour of
draft resolution S/2017/1060.

Japan listened carefully to Ambassador Haley's
statement today. Japan appreciates President Trump's
reaffirmation of his strong commitment to facilitating
a lasting peace agreement and support for a two-State
solution in his recent announcement, and notes well the
importance of the President's clear acknowledgement
that the final status of Jerusalem, including sovereign
boundaries within the city, must be subject to negotiation
between the parties. We welcome that the United States
will continue to play an important role in advancing the
peace process.

We are concerned about the possibility of the
worsening of the environment surrounding the Middle
East peace process or the deterioration ofthe situation of
the wider Middle East region. The continuing unrest on
the ground is worrisome. It is important that the parties
commit to making meaningful progress in the peace
process. Japan appreciates the efforts made by Member
States to bringing parties closer to the negotiation
table. Peace can be achieved only through negotiations
between the parties. Japan, too, will continue to remain
constructively engaged in this issue to promote an
environment conducive to meaningful negotiations
with a view to achieving a two-State solution.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

I now give the floor to the Permanent Observer of
the Observer State of Palestine.
