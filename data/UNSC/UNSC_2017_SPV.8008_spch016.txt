Mr. Seck (Senegal) (spoke in French): Senegal
is not in the habit of delivering a statement following
briefings or consultations. Accordingly, my remarks
will be very brief.

We commend and thank Mr. El-Ghassim Wane,
Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping
Operations, as well as His Excellency President Festus
Mogae. We thank them for their clarifying briefings. I
shall limit my remarks to one question.

Given that we have all reached agreement regarding
our own observations of the situation, what is it that we
are to do as members of the Security Council? We have

all said that there is a need for coordination between
the subregion and the Intergovernmental Authority
on Development, between the region and the African
Union, and at United Nations, particularly the Security
Council. I raise the question because in a few moments
we will meet in informal consultations, when the
Security Council can at last take concrete measures.
