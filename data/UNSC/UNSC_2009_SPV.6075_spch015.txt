The President (spoke in French): I wish to
inform members of the Council that, given scheduling
constraints for the speakers remaining on the list, in
particular the representatives of the Secretariat, whom
we thank for their continued attendance, I intend to
conclude this meeting when the list of speakers is
exhausted, not to suspend and resume it this afternoon.
Therefore, I would respectfully ask my colleagues to
respect the five-minute rule for their statements. I
would be grateful to speakers for distributing their
written statements if they are longer. I would ask
colleagues still on my list of speakers to shorten their
statements as much as possible.
