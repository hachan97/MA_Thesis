Mr. Choi (Republic of Korea): My Government has
maintained a firm and consistent position in emphasizing
the safety of civil aviation. We are convinced that the use
of weapons against unarmed civil aircraft in flight is
unacceptable under any circumstances. Such an act
constitutes a violation of the rules of customary
international law governing international civil aviation, as
now codified in article 3 bis of the Chicago Convention. In
keeping with this view, my delegation joined the Council's
consensus last February in adopting the presidential
statement, which strongly deplored the shooting down of
the two civilian aircraft. At the same time, my delegation
considers it very important for the Security Council to
reaffirm the principle that all States shall take appropriate
measures to prohibit the misuse of civil aircraft.

The draft resolution before us upholds in clear terms
the principles of international law concerning the safety of
civil aviation, to which my Government is fully committed.
The draft resolution rightly condemns the use of weapons
against civil aircraft and reaffirms the obligation of all
States to take measures to prevent the misuse of any civil
aircraft. My delegation, therefore, will vote in favour of
the draft resolution.

In conclusion, my delegation would like to express
our sincere condolences to the families of the victims of
the incident. Indeed, what is most important at this
juncture is to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents
in the future and to secure the safety of civil aviation. To
that end, the principles reaffirmed in the draft resolution
must be fully complied with by all States. It is in this
spirit that my delegation fully endorses paragraph 7 of the
draft resolution, which urges all States which have not yet
done so to ratify as soon as possible the Protocol adding
article 3 bis to the Chicago Convention, and to comply
with all the provisions of the article pending its entry into
force.
