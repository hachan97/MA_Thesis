The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Iraq, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. al-Istrahadi
(Iraq) took a seat at the Council table.

The President (spoke in Spanish): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Ashraf Jehangir
Qazi, Special Representative of the Secretary-General
for Iraq.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Qazi to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2006/ 137, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 30 of
resolution 1546 (2004).

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear
briefings by Mr. Ashraf Jehangir Qazi, Special
Representative of the Secretary-General for Iraq, and
by Mr. John Bolton, representative of the United States
of America, on behalf of the multinational force.
I now give the floor to Mr. Qazi.
