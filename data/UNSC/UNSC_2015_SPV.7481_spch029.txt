Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I should like to make two comments, one
procedural in nature and the other substantive.

The procedural comment is as follows. Today,
several representatives have taken the floor twice, once
in explanation of vote and once on the substantive issue.
We note that, in his first statement, the representative
of France did not say a single word in explanation of his
vote. We believe that such a statement is inappropriate.

On the substance, some delegations - those
of the United States and the United Kingdom in
particular - criticized Russia's position. They distorted
our position, which, I stress, in no way justifies their
comments. I would simply suggest that they should
have listened to our statement more carefully. I do,
however, also have a number of questions in that regard
that I should like to put to the representatives of the
United States and the United Kingdom.

We recently marked the fortieth anniversary of the
end of the war in Viet Nam. Why did we not hold a
Security Council meeting to commemorate that? Why
was no draft resolution presented to condemn the carpet-
bombing of Hanoi, the use of napalm, or the massacre
in My Lai led by Lieutenant Calley, who was pardoned
by the President of the United States? We also recently
marked the tenth anniversary of the illegal invasion
of Iraq by the United States and the United Kingdom,
as a result of which over a million people may have
perished and the entire region remains in crisis to this
very day. Why have the United States and the United
Kingdom not suggested that the Security Council adopt
a resolution on that topic, in which events could be
called by their rightful names?

The problem is that the humanism of these
delegations can be switched on and off depending on
political circumstances, which undermines our trust in
their statements and in their actions.
