Mr. Hardeep Singh Puri (India): I would like to
join other colleagues in thanking Ambassador Nestor
Osorio for presenting the 90-day report of the Security
Council Committee established pursuant to resolution
1737 (2006). We appreciate the work of the Committee
under Ambassador Osorio's stewardship. We also take
note of the Panel of Experts report that is under the
consideration of the 1737 Committee.

As a country that abides by its obligations under
international treaties and has strong credentials on
non-proliferation, India has taken a consistent stand on
the Iran nuclear issue. We support the right of all
States, including Iran, to the peaceful use of nuclear
energy. The exercise of that right should, however, be
consistent with States' international obligations.

We believe that the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) has a central role in the resolution of
technical issues concerning the Iranian nuclear
programme. Iran should cooperate fully with the IAEA
to restore international confidence in the exclusively
peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. We support
the intensification of efforts to address the Iranian
nuclear issue by peaceful means, through dialogue and
negotiation.

We call upon all States to fully implement the
resolutions that the Council has adopted. Every effort
should be made to ensure that the legitimate trade and
economic activities of Iran and other countries do not
suffer while implementing the measures sanctioned by
the relevant resolutions.

Earlier this month the mandate of the Panel of
Experts was extended for another year. We support the
Panel's work to assist the 1737 Committee in a fair and
transparent manner. As with any other panel, we expect
the Panel's work to be in accordance with its mandate.
For our part, we will continue to engage with the other
members of the Committee to enable its work to be
done effectively and efficiently.
