The President (spoke in French): I thank the
Minister of State for External Relations of Cameroon
for his kind words addressed to my country and to
myself.

This was the last speaker in the first round. We
have not noted any questions. Therefore, we will go
straight to the next round. The first speaker on my list
is Mr. Monie Captan, Minister for Foreign Affairs of
Liberia. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table
and to make his statement.
