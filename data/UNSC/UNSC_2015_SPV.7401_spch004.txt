Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China voted in favour of resolution 2209 (2015).
China's position on chemical weapons is clear and
consistent. We resolutely oppose the use of chemical
weapons by anyone in any circumstances, and support
the concerted efforts of all relevant parties to fully
implement the decisions and resolutions adopted by the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
(OPCW) and the Security Council concerning Syrian
chemical weapons. In that process, the authority of the
Chemical Weapons Convention and the OPCW must be
maintained. The Security Council should remain united
and always speak with a unanimous voice, which is
important in achieving success in the Council's relevant
work.

On the basis of this position, China actively
participated in the consultations on resolution 2209
(2015) and vigorously pushed for consensus among
the relevant parties. We hope that the relevant parties
will implement resolution 2209 (2015) in an earnest,
comprehensive and precise manner. Any further actions
taken by the Council on the Syrian chemical weapons
issue should be separately discussed and decided upon
by Council members. We hope that resolution 2209
(2015) will help to fostering further Council consensus
on the Syrian chemical weapons, facilitate the early
completion of the destruction of Syrian chemical
weapons, and provide new impetus for a political
settlement of the Syrian issue.

China will continue to play its active and
constructive role towards a comprehensive, lasting and
appropriate solution of the Syrian issue.
