The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank
the Representative of Pakistan for his kind words addressed
to me.

The next speaker is the Representative of Argentina.
I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make
his statement.

I welcome him to the Council, where he himself sat
not long ago.
