The President (interpretation from Chinese): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report

of the Secretary-General on the situation concerning
Western Sahara, document S/ 1996/343.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/ 1996/382, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to the following other documents: S/ 1996/345,
letter dated 10 May 1996 from the Permanent
Representative of Morocco to the United Nations addressed
to the Secretary-General; S/ 1996/366, letter dated 22 May
1996 from the Permanent Representatives of Namibia and
the United Republic of Tanzania to the United Nations

dated 24 May 1996 from the Charge d'affaires, a.i. of the
Permanent Mission of Ethiopia to the United Nations
addressed to the President of the Security Council.

It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/ 1996/382) before it. If I hear no objection, I shall now
put the draft resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Botswana, Chile, China, Egypt, France, Germany,
Guinea-Bissau, Honduras, Indonesia, Italy, Poland,

The President (interpretation from Chinese): There
were 15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been
