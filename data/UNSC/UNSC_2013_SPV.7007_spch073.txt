Mr. Serry: I will be brief. We have had another
long but, in my view, relatively instructive debate in
which nearly all speakers have registered their strong
support for the important United States-led effort to
relaunch meaningful negotiations and not, as a few
have noted, merely talks about talks. Virtually every
speaker has also stressed the urgency of the situation
and the immediate need for these efforts to provide, at
long last, a credible political horizon for achieving a
two-State solution.

That means that we are heading into yet another
important period, and I want to assure the Council of
the Secretary-General's and my own support for the
important efforts under way. I would stress, in the light
of some statements, that our support includes providing,
as requested, fair, balanced and factual briefings on
what all will agree is a very complex situation in the
Middle East.
