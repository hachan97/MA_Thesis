The President: It is my understanding that the
Council is ready to vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution
to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
I shall first give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the voting.
