Mr. Quarrey (United Kingdom): We join others
in warmly welcoming the Prime Minister of Djibouti
today and also the representatives of Eritrea, the
African Union and the League of Arab States. We
thank Mr. Honwana for his briefing.

Of course, we welcome reports that the situation
is calm at present, but we are also concerned by other
reports of regroupings and reinforcements. The
situation clearly remains fragile in an already very
troubled region. We would reiterate all the concerns
that were set out in the presidential statement of 12
June, including condemnation of the Eritrean military
incursion, deep regret at the loss of life and the need
for maximum restraint.

Like others, we welcome the efforts of the
African Union, the League of Arab States and third
countries to help the parties find a peaceful way
forward. We would urge both parties, and especially
Eritrea, to engage fully with those efforts. We agree
with France that the Council should send a message
today through a statement to the press. We thank the
French delegation for the elements that it circulated
yesterday, which we fully support.
