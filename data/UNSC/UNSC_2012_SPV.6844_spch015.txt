Mr. Osorio (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): Allow
me to first welcome the President of the Special Court
for Sierra Leone, Justice Shireen Avis Fisher, the
Prosectuor, Ms. Brenda Hollis, and the Deputy Minister
for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of
Sierra Leone, Mrs. Ebun Jusu. The briefings that they
have given us today give a clear indication of the
important work and mission that the Special Court for
Sierra Leone has completed.

This is also a good opportunity to reiterate the firm
support of the members of the Security Council for
the Special Court and to express our appreciation and
recognition for all that has been accomplished and for
all ofthe progress that has been made. Of course, among
those results is one that we would consider most visible,
namely, the prosecution and sentencing of Charles
Taylor. That represents a true watershed in the area of
prosecuting individual criminals under international
law. The Special Court has made an extremely important
contribution to developing international criminal
justice. It has also had a positive impact in both Sierra
Leone and Liberia.

In that respect, we believe that the activities aimed
at disseminating and promoting the Court's work have
been essential, as they are the best way to ensure a direct
positive effect on the rule of law and governance in
those countries and the region.

Lastly, I would like to underscore that the Special
Court has also been very active in implementing its
completion strategy. In that connection, we welcome
the signing of an agreement between the United
Nations and the Government of Sierra Leone regarding
the establishment of a Residual Special Court for
Sierra Leone. We call upon States and international
organizations that are in a position to provide financial
support for the implementation of that instrument to
do so. Of course, without that support, the completion
strategy will encounter serious obstacles.
