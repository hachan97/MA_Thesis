Mr. Lucas (Angola): Today, the Security Council
has adopted resolution 2317 (2016), renewing the
mandate of the Monitoring Group on Somalia and
Eritrea. Angola supports the Monitoring Group and
welcomes its tireless efforts to engage with all the
parties and contribute to the improvement of the
security situation in the region and to the compliance
of United Nations Member States with the sanctions
regime imposed on Somalia and Eritrea.

And yet, Angola abstained in the voting today. We
would like to outline the reasons for our vote.

Regarding Somalia, the activities of the Monitoring
Group have contributed significantly to improving the
security situation in the country, as mandated by the
Council. Regarding Eritrea, it should be noted that, for
the third consecutive year, the Monitoring Group has
found no evidence of Eritrean support to the Somali
terrorist group Al-Shabaab. The sanctions regime
has proven to be fruitful, but it must be terminated
when the reasons for its establishment no longer exist.
That should be done through a process in which the
Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea continues
to inform the Security Council on the situation and
support the international community's efforts to bring
stability to the Horn of Africa.

A constructive proposal has been put forward for
the establishment of a road map conducive to changing
the sanctions regime, based on conditions to be agreed
by the Security Council. That proposal would be an
additional encouragement to the Government of Eritrea
to engage further with the international community.
The proposal has not been given due consideration,
which we deeply regret. We take note of the efforts of
the penholder to bring more balance to the text. We
hope that in future, more constructive engagement
among members of the Security Council will achieve
the necessary unity among all its members.
