Mr. Tiirk (Slovenia): Slovenia supports the draft
resolution submitted to the Security Council for action
today. It is a timely and necessary draft resolution. The
situation in the country and in the Great Lakes region as
a whole continues to give rise to concern.

Furthermore, the work of the International
Commission of Inquiry on arms flows, established by
Security Council resolution 1013 (1995), has not yet been
finished. We would like to commend the delegation of the

 

United States for the good work done in preparing the draft.

The reactivation of the International Commission of
Inquiry on illegal arms flows to Rwanda reflects the
willingness of the Government of Rwanda and of the
international community to prevent Violence in that country.
The memories of massacres of civilians, including refugees,
and acts of violence in the Great Lakes region are still
fresh. The recurrence of violence in Rwanda is contributing
to the persistent instability in the Great Lakes region as a
whole. It is necessary that all efforts be made to put an end
to all forms of insurgency and violence.

Recovery from the consequences of genocide,
restoration of stability and security in the country and in the
region, national reconciliation and democratization are
fundamental for economic development and, in particular,
for the creation of a climate conducive to the harmonious
reintegration of the refugees in order to encourage their
return in safety and dignity.

The Commission's recommendations relating to the
illegal flow of arms in the Great Lakes region will provide
essential input for further action by the Security Council.
The appeal to other United Nations bodies, other
organizations and interested parties to collate information in
their possession relating to the Commission's mandate and
to make this information available are therefore necessary.
