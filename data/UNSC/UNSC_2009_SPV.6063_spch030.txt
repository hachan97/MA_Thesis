Mr. Jurica (Croatia): Let me begin by expressing
our appreciation for all efforts to come up with a clear
Council response to the situation in Gaza. We
commend the intense personal engagement of the
ministers, which has made it possible to adopt this
important resolution, which has our full support. The
resolution reflects a number of substantive messages
that have emerged from the thorough diplomatic
engagement in New York and in the region over the
past days.

In view of the ongoing conflict, an immediate,
permanent and effective ceasefire is a necessity - a
ceasefire that will be credible and implemented by all,
one that will eradicate conditions that have led to the
current state of escalation and will end both the
suffering and deprivation in Gaza and the persistent
terrorist threat under which the population of southern
Israel lives. It is important that it does not allow for the
return to the status quo. Only if the conditions on the
ground are suck that they can guarantee a ceasefire that
will be fully respected by both sides, that Israel can be
assured that its population will not be exposed to the
continuing terror of rocket attacks and that weapons
smuggling by Hamas will not be tolerated can we hope
to have a sustainable solution to the crisis. In the
interest of a lasting state of calm, it is imperative that
there be confidence in the mechanisms on the ground.
As intense diplomatic activity in the region continues,
let me reiterate our support for the efforts that Egypt
and others are investing in the process.

Finally, I would like to reiterate Croatia's belief
that political dialogue is the only way to achieve a
lasting peace based on a two-State solution. It is
essential that the Council remain guided by the
objectives reaffirmed by resolution 1850 (2008) in its
efforts to find a solution to this unfolding crisis.
