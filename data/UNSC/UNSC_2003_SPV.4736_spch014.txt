Ms. Menendez (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): I
should like to thank you first of all, Sir, for having
organized this interesting meeting, which we deem to
be very important. I should also like to thank Mr.
Morris for his very interesting briefing, which was
concise but very instructive. Mr. Morris gave us
information that was very graphic and stark. We see the
reality of the problem very clearly.

We have two questions. The first is perhaps
connected to what Ambassador Greenstock just said,
but we wish to ask more specifically: Have we
effectively learned the lessons from success stories and
from less successful stories of the past, in cases where
famine in Africa has been averted and where it has not?
Can the World Food Programme (WFP) tell us what the
Security Council has done, if anything, in those cases,
and what such action might entail in the future?

My second question concerns a concept that Mr.
Morris included in his briefing and which he spoke
about in passing in his first series of answers to our
questions. This is the concept of replenishment. He
said that it is currently very difficult to have a capacity-
building policy when, for example, parents have died
or are ill and cannot pass their knowledge in the
agricultural sphere on to their children. Has WFP,
singly or in cooperation with other agencies,
considered the idea of capacity-replenishment, which
Mr. Morris, I believe, mentioned earlier?
