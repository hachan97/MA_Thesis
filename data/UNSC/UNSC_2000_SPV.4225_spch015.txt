Mr. Toure (Mali) (spoke in French): Like
previous speakers, I would like to thank warmly the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr.
Bernard Kouchner, for his instructive update on the
developments in Kosovo. We congratulate him on the
smooth running of the elections held on 28 October in
Kosovo and on the very high turn-out, which redounds
to the honour of the people of Kosovo and to the
international community through the United Nations
Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).

My delegation pays tribute to Mr. Bernard
Kouchner, the head of UNMIK, to the OSCE and the
entire personnel of UNMIK for their substantive
actions to promote democracy and respect for human
rights in Kosovo, which has made it possible to
produce these good results. We salute the maturity and
sense of responsibility shown by the people of Kosovo
during the municipal elections; this was definitely a
decisive turning point in the democratic process in the
province.

We call upon the political leaders of Kosovo to
accept and respect the verdict of the election and to
work together so that this nascent democracy can be
consolidated, the outcome of which will result in the
holding of general elections.

My delegation salutes the positive changes that
we have seen in Yugoslavia, and we note with
satisfaction that President Kostunica is prepared to
hold negotiations with the Albanian Kosovar
representatives. While we welcome the fact that the
new President has made an important step forward
towards reconciliation between the Serbian and
Albanian communities, we appeal for the release of all
Albanian political detainees still imprisoned in Serbia.

In conclusion, the briefing we have heard this
morning shows that the real challenge resides in the
rapprochement of the communities. Therefore, my
delegation calls upon UNMIK to work further for
peaceful coexistence throughout the entire region of
Kosovo.
