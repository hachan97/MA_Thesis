Mr. Kalomoh (Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs): The draft annual report of the
Security Council for the period 1 August 2004 to 31 July
2005, to be submitted to the General Assembly
pursuant to Article 15, paragraph 1, and Article 24,
paragraph 3, of the United Nations Charter, has been
prepared by the Secretariat in accordance with the
revised format agreed upon by the Security Council in
2002.

The draft report, in the format before the Council,
provides a guide to the activities of the Council in a
concise manner. In that connection, I should like to
note that this is the fourth report prepared in
accordance with the provisions of the note by the
President of the Security Council of 22 May 2002
(S/2002/199), which were aimed at enhancing the
quality of the report and accommodating the views
expressed on the previous format.

Of particular interest is the introduction to the
report, which contains an analytical summary of the
work of the Council for the period covered by the
report.
