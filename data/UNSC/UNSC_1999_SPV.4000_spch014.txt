Sir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): We
share our colleagues' distress and concern over the tragic
incident which caused deaths, injuries and damage in the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade yesterday, and the United
Kingdom expresses its sincere condolences to China, to
the injured and to the families of those killed.

Let me restate the essential points in this matter.
This is a thoroughly unpleasant crisis. More than a
million people have been systematically beaten and burnt
out of their homes in Kosovo, with several thousand of
them killed as a result of President Milosevic's deliberate
decisions, and we have not met at midnight over them.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has
taken urgent and forceful action to reverse that
humanitarian tragedy and to return the displaced to their
homes in safety. But we are not in the business of
selective concern. We must remember that the people of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia generally have
suffered from President Milosevic's policies and are still
doing so. He carries the full responsibility for their
condition.

So it is tragic that representatives of China should
have been caught up by accident in this crisis. NATO has
expressed its regrets, and we await the results of its
investigation. NATO does not target civilians or
embassies. It is a gross distortion to imply that the
Chinese Embassy was deliberately attacked.

We are all agreed that the conflict must conclude as
soon as possible. The key to that is the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia's acceptance of the steps spelt out in the
G-8 statement of 6 May, and that key lies in the hands of
President Milosevic.
