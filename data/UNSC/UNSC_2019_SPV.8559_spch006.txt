Mrs. Gueguen (France) (spoke in French): We
welcome the adoption of resolution 2476 (2019),
which launches the United Nations Integrated Office
in Haiti as of 16 October and establishes its mandate
for the following 12 months. The work of the Office
will focus on providing strategic advice to the Haitian
authorities and the Haitian National Police and
should support the country's priorities with regard to
security, development, respect for human rights and the
entrenchment of the rule of law. Since the country is
still facing many challenges, the situation requires not
only the continuing commitment of every branch of the
Haitian authorities but also strong support from Haiti's
international partners, starting with the United Nations.

Political instability, deteriorating economic
conditions, the very worrying state of the country's
public finances, food insecurity, problems with access
to basic services and high levels of violence continue
to be a source of concern. There is still a great deal
to be done in order to build strong institutions and the
legislative framework that is essential to entrenching
the rule of law and fighting corruption and impunity.
The United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti will
therefore begin its mission in a difficult context, and
sadly we fear that the extremely volatile situation is
likely to deteriorate in the coming weeks and months,
which the work of the new Office will have to fully take
into account.

It is a pity that the resolution adopted today does
not consider the impact of climate change on Haiti's
situation and security. In this difficult context, France
encourages Haiti's political leaders to do everything
possible to create the conditions for sustainable
development in stability and to promote the national
dialogue that the great majority of Haitians aspire to.
France remains more than ever committed to supporting
the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti in its
future work.
