Mr. Shen Guofang (China) (spoke in Chinese): First
of all, I should like to thank Ms. Carla Del Ponte,
Prosecutor of the International Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia and of the International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda, for her briefing today.

We have taken note of the achievements registered by
the two Tribunals over the past year. We attach particular
importance to the way in which the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda interpreted and applied the 1948
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the
Crime of Genocide in its judgment on the Akayesu case.

We are aware that these advances are being made by
the two Tribunals at a time when they are facing
tremendous difficulties and challenges. We have noted
also that there is still room for improvement in their
work, inter alia the disputes between the States and the
Tribunals in the field of cooperation. Both Tribunals were
established by Security Council resolutions; the countries
concerned should therefore cooperate with them, in
accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions,
the Statutes of the Tribunals, and their national laws.

The Tribunals, in requesting cooperation from the
States concerned, should also take into consideration the
public interests and security of those countries. They
should also respect the national laws of those States.
Failing that, the Tribunals will continue to face daunting
tasks in future. We sincerely hope that their work will be
professional, objective, impartial and free from any
political interference.

In conclusion, I should like to reiterate that China
continues to support the work of both Tribunals.
