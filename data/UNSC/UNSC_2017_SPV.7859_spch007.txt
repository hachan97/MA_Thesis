Mr. Lambertini (Italy): I thank Special
Representative of the Secretary-General Jean Arnault
for his strong commitment.

As this is the first time that, as a member, we
participate in the Security Council in a meeting with
the delegation of Colombia, we would like to take
this opportunity to commend the agreement signed in
Colombia and to encourage all stakeholders to contribute
to peace and to strengthen efforts so that peace
dividends will be delivered by the agreed deadlines.
On 15 and 16 December 2016, President Santos
Calderon attended the International Conference on the
Rule of Law and Security in Latin America, organized
in Rome. On that occasion, he met Italy's President
Mattarella, Prime Minister Gentiloni Silveri and he
heard of Italy's strong commitment to assuring the
success of the peace process in Colombia. On that
occasion, three bilateral agreements on judiciary
cooperation were signed. We are two countries that have
a lot of know-how with respect to fighting international
criminal organizations.

I want to point out something very important to
us regarding the recruitment and use of children in
the armed conflict. Italy commends the Government
of Colombia for structurally including the separation
of children in the framework of the Final Peace
Agreement. We believe that such an approach could
establish best practices and serve as a good example
for other countries that face similar challenges. We
also welcome the agreement in May 2016, which laid
out a way forward for the separation for children under
the age of 15 and for a special programme for the
restoration of rights and the reintegration of all children
under the age of 18. We encourage moving forward
with its implementation. Italy is willing to support
the Government of Colombia in that endeavour. We
are ready to cooperate with the Council in the vested
interest of its people. Congratulations to Colombia.
