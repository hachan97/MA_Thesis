Mr. Ould-Abdallah (spoke in French): As it is
late, I will not be long-winded. I would just like to
thank Council members and the African speakers for
the attention they are giving to the problems of the
region and for the support they expressed. My
colleagues and I will be seeking to implement the main
elements in the statements, and we will be
communicating bilaterally with the States concerned
and in the next report of the Secretary-General.
