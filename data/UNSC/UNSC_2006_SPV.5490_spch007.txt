Mr. Mayoral (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): I
shall be brief.

Argentina would like to express its satisfaction at
the Security Council's adoption of resolution 1695
(2006), which condemns the launching of missiles by
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on 5 July.
We believe that the message that the Security Council
has sent today to the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea is a strong one. Argentina hopes that the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea will return to
the negotiating table and the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and that it will
henceforth stop developing its nuclear weapons.
In that context, we would like to thank the
countries of the region that are primarily affected by
the launching of these missiles for their understanding
and cooperation in making it possible for the Security
Council to adopt the resolution. They were able to act
wisely and to give priority to the promotion of
international peace and security over certain domestic
policy concerns.

Finally, on behalf of my delegation, I would also
like to thank the Ambassador of the United Kingdom
for his intervention to achieve agreement. I also wish
to thank you, Mr. President, for your tireless work and
talent in the search for a fair solution acceptable to all.
