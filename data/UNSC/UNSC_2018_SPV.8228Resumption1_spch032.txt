Mr. Skoog (Sweden): We deeply regret that we
have ended up here following a long day of serious
efforts to move forward by some of us - I believe.
We abstained in the voting on the Russian draft
resolution (S/2018/322) a few moments ago because the
attribution and accountability track, which we believe
is important, lacked clarity. We called for consultations
earlier because we felt that, provided there was political
will, an opportunity remained for us to come together
and shoulder our responsibility today.

We put forward a draft resolution (S/2018/321) to
all members that we felt was credible and assertive,
and was intended to support the Fact-finding Mission
of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons. It was also very clear in its determination
to establish an impartial, independent and professional
investigative mechanism, and we had suggested that
the Secretary-General help us recommend the best way
forward in that area and give him 10 days to come back
to the Council. I believe that would have been a much
better way forward than where we are right now.

I am therefore very disappointed that we have not
been able to move forward on this. I thank all those
members of the Security Council that were ready to
engage, and I just hope that we do not consider this
the end with regard to ensuring that the facts will be
established and that there will be true accountability
and no more impunity for the horrendous use of
chemical weapons in Syria and elsewhere.
