The President (spoke in Spanish): I should now
like to give Mr. Morris the opportunity to respond to
the questions raised. That will allow Council members
who wish to pose questions that Mr. Morris has already
answered to skip those questions and focus on the
responses that he will now give us. I call on
Mr. Morris.
