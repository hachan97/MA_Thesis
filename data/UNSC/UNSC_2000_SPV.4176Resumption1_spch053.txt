The President: I thank Ms. Bellamy and Mr.
Otunnu for their participation in our debate today, and
certainly we look forward to continuing to work with
them.

I also wish to thank all of those who have
participated in the Council's open debate. Their
contribution will certainly enrich the Council's
consideration of the item "Children and armed
conflict".

The next meeting of the Security Council to
continue the consideration of the item on its agenda
will be fixed in consultation with the members of the
Council.

The meeting rose at 7.30 p.m.
