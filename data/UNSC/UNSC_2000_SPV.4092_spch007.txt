The President: I thank the President of the Republic
of Mozambique for his very important statement. I also
note his current chairmanship of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC); I think this gives
added weight to some of the points that he has made. I
would also like to thank him for his kind words addressed
to the American presidency.

I now call on Mr. Laurent-Desire Kabila, President
of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
