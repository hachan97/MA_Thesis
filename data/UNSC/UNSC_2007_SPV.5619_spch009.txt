Mr. Mantovani (Italy): Italy voted in favour of
the draft resolution because it profoundly shares the
concerns expressed in the text on the grievances that so
deeply affect the people of Myanmar. Those concerns
are reflected in the European Union's common position
on Myanmar. Italy believes that it is now time to call
for accelerated progress in a number of problematic
areas.

But let me clearly state our View that in the case
of Myanmar, punitive approaches have not yielded
satisfactory results and should not be sought by the
Council. While we remain convinced that a consensual
attitude would have been more effective, Italy strongly
calls for increased dialogue in the future to overcome
misperceptions and to achieve the goal that we all
share, namely the prosperity of Myanmar and of its
people.
