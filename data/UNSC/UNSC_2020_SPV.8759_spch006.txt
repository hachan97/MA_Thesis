Mr. Hunter (United States of America): The United States commends the penholders for the cooperative spirit in which they led this process and specifically both the Ambassadors for their personal commitment and their teams' personal commitment to the future of Afghanistan. We thank them both. The United States remains deeply committed to Afghanistan and to Special Representative of the Secretary-General Lyons' work and leadership at the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). As the Mission sustains support to the people of Afghanistan during this pivotal period in the country's history, and as the parties embark on peace negotiations ona political solutiontoend the conflict, the United States supports the objectives of promoting accountability in Afghanistan and addressing Afghanistan's legacy of large-scale human rights violations and abuses. Of course, we would have serious concerns if, contrary to our understanding, UNAMA were to interpret resolution 2543 (2020) to mandate UNAMA to support the International Criminal Court's (ICC) illegitimate investigation against United States personnel. The United States reiterates that it is not a party to the Rome Statute and has consistently rejected ICC assertions of jurisdiction over United States personnel. We will not tolerate any attempts to subject Americans to the ICC's jurisdiction. The United States remains committed to the promotion of accountability, but the ICC and parties to the Rome Statute must respect the decisions of the United States and other countries and not subject theirpersonnel to the ICC's jurisdiction, consistent with the respect of sovereign prerogatives.
