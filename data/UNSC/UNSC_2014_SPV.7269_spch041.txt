Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I would just like to respond to the statement
made just now by the representative of Lithuania and
then to the representative of the United Kingdom.

I do not really understand why the representative of
Lithuania is raising the question. Why would Russia not
convene the meeting? She blamed us for this incident,
but then when we have questions about the course of the
investigations, she says that this is somehow insulting
to the memory of the victims. That is, indeed, some
kind of extreme cynicism. The best way to pay due
tribute to the memory of the victims is by answering
all the questions by undertaking an investigation in
accordance with resolution 2166 (2014).

With regard to the statement made by our English
colleague, one of his great approaches is not to dispute
what we say in the Council, but to interpretat what I said
or might have said in the press somewhere. However, let
us carefully look at what was said in the Council.

As to my somehow not having spoken truthfully,
take all the records of our meetings and highlight the
areas where I did not speak truthfully and show them
to me. I am talking about transcriptions, because what
my colleague has said about my statements was totally
inaccurate.
