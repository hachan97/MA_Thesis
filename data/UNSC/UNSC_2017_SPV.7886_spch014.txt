Mr. Aboulatta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): My
country's delegation would like to express its most
sincere condolences to the Mission of the Russian
Federation to the United Nations as well to the
Government and the people of Russia for the passing of
Ambassador Vitaly Churkin. In our View, Ambassador
Churkin was an exceptional diplomat when it came
to the United Nations and the Security Council. He
deserved the respect of all the delegations. Thanks to
his professionalism and credibility, his sudden passing
is a great loss not only for Russian diplomacy but
also for the Security Council, the United Nations and
multilateral diplomacy.
