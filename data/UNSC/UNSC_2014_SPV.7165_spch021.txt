Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I certainly do not want to prolong our meeting
here this evening. The simplest of answers would be to
again read the statement I made earlier, which refletcts
our vision and position. However, allow me a very brief
comment.

A great deal has been said here about some sort of
wrong interpretation of our positions and statements in
various forums and situations. Our Ukrainian colleague
even began to depict some fantastic scenario of how he
views the further developments unfolding in Ukraine.
The only scenario that I would want to hear - but
do not - is one that includes genuine efforts by the
authorities in Kyiv to implement the Geneva document.
Mr.Feltman began by saying that there were various
interpretation of that document. The document is so
simple, there is nothing to interpret. There is nothing to
be done but to implement it. Let us do so. Russia helped
to draw it up. But the actions backing it up need to be
taken, first and foremost, by the authorities in Kyiv, if
that is what they are. Unfortunately, their lack of action
is reflected in the statement I made here earlier today.
