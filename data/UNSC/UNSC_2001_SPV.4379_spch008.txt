Mr. Eldon (United Kingdom): I, too, will be
extremely brief. I can afford to do so not least because
the representative of the European Union will be
speaking later in the debate.

I would like to focus on three key points, the first
of which is the streamlining exercise. I do not think it
would be appropriate now for me to go into the details
of the pros and cons one way or the other. Certainly, as
Ambassador Hume said, the future police presence is
going to be one key element of whatever is put
together. But I think that we, the international
community generally and the Steering Board will look
to be presented later in the year with a solution with
which all the various constituent bodies and
organizations are happy; which avoids duplication; and
which meets the long-term vision, so to speak, about
which Mr. Petritsch and Mr. Klein have spoken.

I would just like to take this opportunity to say to
the Office of the High Representative and to the High
Representative himself that we hope that work will be
taken forward quickly against the sort of background
and within the parameters that I have just outlined.

Secondly, on the State Border Service, Mr. Klein
referred to the recent memorandum of understanding
that the United Kingdom signed with the United
Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We
continue to regard the State Border Service as a matter
of high priority, and I was very interested to hear that
75 per cent of the border is now covered. We would be
interested to have Mr. Klein's assessment later on as to
how long it will take to cover 100 per cent of the
border.

Finally, I would just like to support what
Ambassador Hume said about refugee returns and ask
what progress there has been on implementing the
Constitutional Court's decision on constituent peoples.

It will be interesting to hear from Mr. Petritsch whether

the entities' Constitutional Commissions are yet close

to reaching an agreement on this subject.
