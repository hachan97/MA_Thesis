Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We do not want to extend our discussion with
the representative of Ukraine, but it is clear that the
Ukrainian delegation is using any excuse to disseminate
its insinuations and accusations in order to detract from
opinions about Kyiv's intention to not implement the
Minsk agreements and the measures set out therein, in
particular the political portion. We must not forget the
primary fact that the Ukrainian authorities are using
the weapons at their disposal to carry out attacks in
Donbas, which are leading to the deaths of civilians and
the destruction of civilian infrastructure.
