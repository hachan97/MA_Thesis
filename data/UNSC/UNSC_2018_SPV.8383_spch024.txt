Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I will be just as brief as my British colleague.
She asked a very specific question about whether or not
the recent Russian-Turkish Idlib agreement is in effect.
Yes, it is still being implemented, as we said in our
statement. At the same time, I would like to confirm
what the representative of the Syrian Arab Republic
said, which is that we are talking about an area that
is part of sovereign Syria. It goes without saying that
we believe that, ultimately, the legitimate Syrian
authorities will retake control over all of the territory
that makes up the Syrian Arab Republic. There are no
contradictions between those two points.
