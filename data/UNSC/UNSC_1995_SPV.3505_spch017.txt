The President: There are a number of names
remaining on the list of speakers. In View of the lateness
of the hour, and with the concurrence of the members of
the Council, I intend to suspend the meeting now. The
Security Council will continue consideration of the item
on its agenda later this afternoon at 3.30 pm.

The meeting was suspended at 1.30 pm.
