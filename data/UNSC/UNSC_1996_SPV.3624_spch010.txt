Mr. Park (Republic of Korea): I would like to join
you, Mr. President, in welcoming His Excellency
Mr. Kromah, Member of the Collective Presidency of the
Liberian National Transitional Government. I thank him
for the informative statement he made here today. It is
reassuring to hear from him that the Collective Presidency
is committed to achieving a lasting peace.

My Government's views on the situation in Liberia
are already known from my statement in the orientation
debate last week. I will not repeat them here today.
Rather, let me confine myself to stressing a few important
points to which my Government attaches particular
importance.

First, we commend the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) for its central role in
restoring peace and stability in Liberia, and we express
our appreciation to the troop-contributing countries. We
reiterate the importance of close cooperation and
coordination between the United Nations Observer
Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL), ECOWAS and the
Member States concerned for the success of peace-
keeping operations in Liberia. This three-way cooperation,
in our view, sets an example that can be applied in
dealing with other situations in Africa.

Secondly, we call upon all factions in Liberia to
abide by their commitments to the peace process as
envisaged in the Abuja Agreement. While deploring the
recent incident of renewed hostilities, which was a
setback to the peace process, we look forward to smooth
progress in the disarmament and demobilization of
combatants and in their reintegration into civil society.

Thirdly, we reiterate our View that the international
community cannot replace the Liberian people's own
efforts to achieve peace, national reconciliation and
democracy. It is the people and the leaders of Liberia
themselves who are ultimately responsible for rebuilding
a land of peace, liberty and prosperity.

 

In keeping with these remarks, my delegation will vote
in favour of the draft resolution before us.
