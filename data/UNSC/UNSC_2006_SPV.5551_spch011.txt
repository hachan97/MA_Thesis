Mr. Choi (Republic of Korea): Last Monday,
9 October, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
announced that it had conducted a nuclear test.
Pyongyang did so in complete disregard of the repeated
warnings of my Government and the international
community. The action taken by North Korea poses a
grave threat, undermining peace and stability on the
Korean peninsula and beyond.

North Korea also betrayed the hope of the
international community to resolve the North Korean
nuclear issue peacefully through dialogue. North
Korea's conduct constitutes a failure to meet its
obligations under the 19 September 2005 Joint
Statement, on which all parties to the Six-Party Talks
concurred. North Korea's conduct is in outright
defiance of Security Council resolution 1695 (2006),
adopted on 15 July.

Further, the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea's action constitutes an unacceptable breach of
the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the
Korean Peninsula that it signed with my country in
1991. In that context, we have made it clear that North
Korea's acts will never be condoned and that their
impact on inter-Korean relations can only be negative.
My Government appreciates the efforts of the
members of the Security Council to address this grave
common challenge. My Government supports fully the
resolution just adopted unanimously by the Security
Council. We urge North Korea to heed carefully the
united voice of the international community and to
refrain from any action that would further aggravate
the situation on the Korean peninsula. North Korea
should return immediately to the Six-Party Talks
without any preconditions. North Korea should
abandon its nuclear weapons and missile programmes
once and for all.

Working in close cooperation with the
international community, my Government will pursue
its endeavours to achieve those goals.
