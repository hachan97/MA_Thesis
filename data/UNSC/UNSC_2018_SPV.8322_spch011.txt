The President: There are no more names inscribed
on the list of speakers. Before adjourning the meeting,
and as this may be the Council's last meeting in the
month of July, I would like to express the sincere
appreciation of the delegation of Sweden to all those
who have supported us in our presidency during the
past month.

First, I want to thank our colleagues from the Security
Council Affairs Division for their professionalism and
courtesy over the past month, including the Conference
Management Service, officers, interpreters, verbatim
reporters and security staff, who have, as always, done
an outstanding, very generous and supportive job. I
thank all of them. I also want to thank other parts of
the Secretariat that have supported us on substance
updates, and so forth, and as briefers on a regular basis.

Of course, I want to thank all the members of the
Council and their teams for their support, excellent
cooperation and constant good spirits at every level.
I am particularly pleased that we have been able to
come together to speak with one voice on so many
issues this month. I also thank other Member States
for their engagement, support and, in many cases, very
valuable contributions to the open debates that we have
had. I also thank the media and civil society for their
consistent engagement.

Finally, I want to say a huge thank-you to my
fantastic team, many of whom are here today and who
have worked very hard over the past month. As a final
comment, I know that I have the support of all members
in speaking on their behalf when I say good luck to
Ms. Pierce and her team. We feel absolutely at ease
handing the gavel over to her.

The meeting rose at 11.05 a.m.
