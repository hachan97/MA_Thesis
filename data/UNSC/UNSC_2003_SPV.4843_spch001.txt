The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Australia, India, Italy, Japan,
Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Portugal,
Singapore and Timor-Leste, in which they request to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Guterres
(Timor-Leste) took a seat at the Council table; at
the invitation of the President, the representatives
of the other aforementioned countries took the
seats reserved for them at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Kamalesh Sharma, Special
Representative of the Secretary-General for Timor-
Leste and Head of Mission.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Sharma to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2003/944, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the United Nations Mission of
Support in East Timor.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Kamalesh Sharma, Special
Representative of the Secretary-General for Timor-
Leste and Head of Mission.

I welcome Mr. Sharma once again to the Council;
I now give him the floor.
