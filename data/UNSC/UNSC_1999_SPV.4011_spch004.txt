Mr. Andjaba (Namibia): On 24 March this year, in
this very Chamber, my delegation called for a cessation
of hostilities in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and
appealed to the parties concerned to find a political
solution. We have reiterated that call many a time and
today my delegation is pleased that, finally, diplomacy
has prevailed. We thank all those who have made it

 

possible. We sincerely hope that this marks the end of
military action against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

It is regrettable, however, that only after the senseless
killing of innocent civilians, the destruction of property and
the massive displacement of people has a peace plan been
possible. Indeed, the international community must draw
important lessons from the situation in and around Kosovo.

While the end of hostilities in the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia is hopefully in sight, the root historical causes
of this conflict should be addressed fully. Only then can
lasting peace be guaranteed in Kosovo and the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia as a whole.

Namibia does not condone ethnic cleansing and other
human rights abuses committed in the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia. Equally, we oppose any attempt to dismember
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, now or in the future.
The purposes and principles of the Charter of the
United Nations are clear. It is the primary responsibility of
the Security Council to maintain international peace and
security. All States Members of the United Nations have
the obligation to uphold the provisions of the Charter in
that regard.
