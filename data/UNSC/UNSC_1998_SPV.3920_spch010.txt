Mr. Dahlgren (Sweden): International terrorism
constitutes a threat not only to individual lives, but also
to international peace and security. This was true 10 years
ago and is still true today, as we unfortunately have just
recently experienced.

The search for clarity and justice in the cases of Pan
Am flight 103 and UTA flight 772 has never ceased. We
owe this to the victims, some of whom were Swedish
citizens, and to their families. For the future, it is also
crucial that instigators and perpetrators of acts of
terrorism be made to understand that the international
community is fully committed to bringing them to justice
and preventing such cowardly acts from recurring.

In the case of Pan Am flight 103, the refusal of
Libya to surrender for trial the two suspects prompted the
Security Council to impose sanctions on Libya. In the
light of the previous lack of progress on this issue, my
Government warmly welcomes the initiative now taken by
the United Kingdom and the United States, in close
cooperation with the Netherlands, which will open the
way for a trial before a Scottish court in the Netherlands.

The initiative now taken is fully in line with
proposals previously put forward by, inter alia, the Arab
League and the Organization of African Unity, and which
have been accepted by Libya. We were glad to hear that
acceptance repeated tonight. Sweden now urges Libya to
cooperate fully so that the draft resolution we are about

 

to adopt can be implemented without further delay. That
draft resolution means that the sanctions imposed on Libya
will be suspended immediately when the Secretary-General
reports that the two Lockerbie suspects have arrived in the
Netherlands for the purpose of the trial and that the Libyan
Government has satisfied the French judicial authorities in
the UTA case. My Government sincerely hopes that Libya
will promptly seize this opportunity so that justice can
finally be done.
