Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We would like to draw the attention of
our Ukrainian colleagues to the fact that there is a
mechanism to observe the situation in the south-
east of Ukraine - the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission to
Ukraine. Every day, and sometimes even twice a day, it
visits areas that are not controlled by the Government,
and in none of its reports has it written about any mass
movements of weapons or troops.

With regard to the security of the nuclear facilities
in Crimea after it was returned to the Russian
Federation, we informed the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) that all nuclear facilities on
the Crimean peninsula were under reliable control
and were working safely and in compliance with the
provisions of the IAEA.
