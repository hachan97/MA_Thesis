Mr. Urbina (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish):
Costa Rica considers it of the greatest importance that
the Security Council has reached the requisite
unanimity to respond to a major challenge to
international peace and security. We have confirmed
this perception with the unequivocal backing for the
resolution we have just adopted. It seems to my
delegation that the text voted on by the Council makes
measured use of the instruments at the disposal of the
international community to respond to that major
challenge.
We trust that the Council's action today will
reactivate the strengthening of the international
non-proliferation regime and provide a major boost to
the encouraging announcements of new steps in the

field of global disarmament. We think that the
resolution is also an opportunity for the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea to return to the
international mechanisms for dialogue, and we urge it
to do so as soon as possible.
