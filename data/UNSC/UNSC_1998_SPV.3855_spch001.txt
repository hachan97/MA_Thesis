The President (interpretation from French): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 7 of
resolution 1143 (1997), document S/ 1998/90, and the letter
dated 30 January 1998 from the Chairman of the Security
Council Committee established by resolution 661 (1990)
concerning the situation between Iraq and Kuwait addressed
to the President of the Security Council, document
S/ 1998/92.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/l998/l36, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of members of the
Council to document S/ 1998/ 125, which contains the text of
a letter dated 15 February 1998 from the Permanent
Representative of Iraq to the United Nations addressed to
the Secretary-General, transmitting the text of a letter of the
same date from the Deputy Prime Minister and Acting
Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq
addressed to the Secretary-General.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless I hear any
objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
I shall first call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements before the voting.
