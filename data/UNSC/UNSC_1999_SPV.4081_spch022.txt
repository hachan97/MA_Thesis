The President: Thank you very much, Ambassador.
After you so fulsomely praised my speeches and quoted
from them, what else can I do but to fulsomely thank you
and congratulate you on your excellent judgement. May
I apologize also for wrongly pronouncing your name.

I would also like to commend you on your frankness
and say that I very much agree with the points you made
about different agencies sharing intelligence and making
sure that that is available to target and track down those
who are breaking United Nations sanctions illegally. In
the case of Angola, that is especially relevant.
