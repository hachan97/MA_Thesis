Mr. Heusgen (Germany): Germany voted in favour of resolution 2550 (2020) and supports the new mandate of the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei. However, we express our strong reservation about the wording with regard to the humanitarian principles. The humanitarian principles are the fundamental basis for the delivery of humanitarian assistance. Their essential character as core principles has been recognized and reaffirmed by the Security Council in countless resolutions. We do not recognize any interpretation that would suggest that the humanitarian principles are subordinate to the United Nations guiding principles, which are a framework of good practices developed by the General Assembly. Germany does not support that notion and deems it incorrect. The meeting rose at 10.10 a.m.
