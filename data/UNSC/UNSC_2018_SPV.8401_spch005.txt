Mr. Van Oosterom (Netherlands): We would like
to thank France for its leadership in facilitating the
negotiations for the renewal of the mandate of the United
Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization
Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA).
In recent weeks we have had extensive and important
discussions on the situation in the Central African
Republic, including on how to improve MINUSCA's
role in the political process and its mandate to protect
civilians. The Kingdom of the Netherlands fully
supports the draft text that France initially put in blue.
It maintains the Mission's troop ceiling and priority
tasks, as well as its logistical support to the Central
African Republic armed forces. We hope it will be
possible for the Council to adopt that text as a draft
resolution very soon. The people of the Central African
Republic deserve the Council's unanimous support.
