Mr. Saikal (Afghanistan): On behalf of the
Government of Afghanistan and of the people
of Afghanistan, allow me to thank the Security
Council for taking a very firm stand on the course of
democratization in our country. We have made some
significant gains in that field over the past 18 years, and
it is important to strengthen and consolidate those gains
and to make sure that they become sustainable. There is
absolutely no doubt that the people of Afghanistan are
eager to see free, fair and credible parliamentary and
district council elections in October and the presidential
election next year.

Today's statement from the Security Council is
a very clear sign that the international community
has a keen interest in seeing free and fair elections in
Afghanistan. Now, it is the job of us - the Government
of Afghanistan, the relevant ministries and agencies of
our Government, the political parties of Afghanistan,
political leaders, civil society and, most important of
all, the independent electoral bodies of our country - to
put our hands together to pave the way for reasonably
free and fair elections in October and a presidential
election next year. I have no doubt that, in doing so, we
enjoy the full support of the people of Afghanistan and
of the international community, as symbolized by the
statement of the Security Council today.

The meeting rose at 10.15 61.111.
