Mr. Valle (Brazil): Brazil joined the consensus
regarding the adoption of resolution 1638 (2005). Our
vote reflects our firm commitment to the settlement of
all conflicts in Africa. However, we emphasize that the
promotion of the rule of law in a country should be
exercised primarily by national institutions, with
international assistance if so requested. Adherence to
the rule of law should be based on strict observance of
the domestic legal framework and of international law.
