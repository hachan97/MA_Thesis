Mr. Rudolph (Germany): Germany voted in favour of
the resolution, which extends the mandate of UNOMIL
until 30 June. The situation on the ground and the progress

 
in the peace process do not necessarily justify extending
UNOMIL's mandate. In fact, the situation has
deteriorated: there is still no agreement on the
composition of the Council of State, and the cease-fire
has broken down.

Nevertheless, we believe that the Council must give
the scheduled summit meeting of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), to be
held in Abuja under the auspices of the Government of
Nigeria, the chance to achieve the much-needed positive
breakthrough for war-stricken Liberia. In this context, we
would like to reiterate our support for the efforts of
ECOWAS and its Military Monitoring Group in assisting
the peace process in Liberia.

The ECOWAS summit will be of extreme
importance, and we urge all parties concerned to attend it
and to work together, in a spirit of goodwill and
compromise, to find a way out of the tragic impasse that
has characterized the situation in Liberia for so long.

The factions in Liberia must realize that they bear
the responsibility for reaching a lasting settlement to the
crisis in their country. We therefore urge them to respect
the cease-fire and to implement the other provisions of
the Accra Agreement. In the absence of real progress, it
will be increasingly difficult for the international
community to continue to assist Liberia.

The Council will therefore have to examine very
carefully the future of the United Nations presence in
Liberia when the current mandate expires at the end of
June.
