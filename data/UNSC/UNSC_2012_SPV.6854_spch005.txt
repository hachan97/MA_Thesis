Mr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish):
Allow me at the outset to congratulate you, Sir, on
India's assumption of the presidency of the Council. I
wish you every success in your work.

Our delegation voted in favour of resolution
2073 (2012) because we consider it essential for the
Security Council to maintain its unanimous support for
Somalia, a country that has undergone historic changes
in recent months. We should, however, have preferred
a resolution that had addressed all the pertinent facts
affecting the mandate of the African Union Mission in
Somalia (AMISOM), rather than provide a temporary
extension that selectively addresses certain themes and

postpones the consideration of others. We regret, for
instance, the fact that the resolution does not include
the AMISOM. maritime component.
We believe that the Security Council should
continue to lend its firm support to the African Union
Mission in Somalia and are pleased that the United
Nations logistical support package has been extended.
We look forward with interest to the assessment of
United Nations and AMISOM. activities in Somalia,
which is of utmost importance in resolving the variety
ofissues that have arisen.
