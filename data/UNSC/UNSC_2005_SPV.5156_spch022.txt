The President: I thank the representative of
Indonesia for his kind words addressed to me.

I would also like to take this opportunity, on
behalf of the Council, to extend our condolences with
respect to the recent earthquake in Indonesia, which
saddened us all very much. I request the representative
of Indonesia to convey to his Government that
expression of condolence.
