Mrs. Kawar (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): At the
outset, I would like to thank Ms. Fatima Bensouda,
Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC),
for her briefing today and for presenting the twenty-
second report to the Security Council pursuant to
resolution 1593 (2005), of which we take note.

Jordan reiterates the importance of the role played
by the Court in effectively supporting stability and
the maintenance of international peace and security
and upholding the rule of law. The Court is a major
pillar in strengthening criminal justice, prosecuting
the most serious crimes under international law, and
ending impunity for the perpetrators of such crimes,
which is a matter of concern for the entire international
community. Jordan also reiterates the importance of
cooperating with the ICC to implement its mandate and
the relevant Security Council resolutions.

Jordan remains concerned about the report's
references to the prevailing humanitarian situation
in Darfur, the continued violations of human rights
and international humanitarian law, and the repeated
attacks against civilians and humanitarian workers
and peacekeepers. It is also necessary to stress the
importance of adopting a sustainable development plan
that addresses the real needs of the local population in
Darfur, allows them to meet the economic and social
challenges and guarantees the return ofrefugees to their
original territories, because justice and development
must be brought to the region if security and stability
are to be restored.

Finally, it is worth saying that sustainable peace
cannot be achieved without the cooperation and
coordination of all the relevant stakeholders.
