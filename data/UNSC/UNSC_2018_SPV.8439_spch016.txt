The President (spoke in French): Before adj ourning
the meeting, as this is the last scheduled meeting of
the Council for the month of December, I would like
to express the sincere appreciation of the delegation of
Cote d'Ivoire to the members of the Council, especially
the Permanent Representatives and their respective
staff, and to the Secretariat for all the support they have
given us.

As we conclude a busy month, we can congratulate
ourselves on having reached consensus on several
important issues within our purview. We could not
have done it alone or without the hard work, support
and positive contributions of every delegation and
the representatives of the Secretariat, as well as of
all relevant conference service officers, interpreters,
translators, Verbatim Reporters and security staff.

Throughout its entire presidency, my country has
stayed true to its philosophy of dialogue and peace. It
has worked hard in consistently seeking the consensus
of all Member States in order to maintain the unity and
effectiveness of the Council. We pray that this unity
and effectiveness will endure.

As we end our presidency, I know that I speak
on behalf of the Council in wishing the delegation of
the Dominican Republic good luck in its presidency
for the month of January. On behalf of the Council, I
should like to express my sincere appreciation to the
five outgoing members, namely, the Plurinational State
of Bolivia, Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands and
Sweden. I commend the work they have done and the
contributions they have made during their terms on the
Security Council.

The meeting rose at 2.05 pm.
