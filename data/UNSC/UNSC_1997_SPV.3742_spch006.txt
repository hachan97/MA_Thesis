Mr. Gomersall (United Kingdom): On behalf of Her
Majesty's Government, I wish to express our regret on
learning of the recent death of Mr. Deng Xiaoping. He
played a historic role in the development of modern China,
most recently through the economic reform programme and
China's greater opening to the outside world. With his
visionary concept of "one country, two systems", he made
a major contribution to the conclusion by the United
Kingdom and China of the Joint Declaration on Hong Kong
in 1984.

We offer our condolences to Mr. Deng's family and
to the people of China.
