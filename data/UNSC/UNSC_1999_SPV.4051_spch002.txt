Mr. Farhadi (Afghanistan): The Government of the
Islamic State of Afghanistan supports the draft resolution of
the Security Council to be adopted today. We are of the
view that the set of measures contained in the draft
resolution is an adequate signal to the Taliban and to their
Pakistani mentors: it indicates that the international
community is extremely concerned about the adventurist
policy of Pakistan and the Taliban, which is a major threat
to international peace and security.

Despite the mild and limited nature of the draft
resolution to be adopted today, the political message which
it contains is strong. Foreign supporters of the Taliban
should take the necessary measures to dissociate
themselves from the "Talibanization" of the region. The
draft resolution directly affects the financial resources of
the Taliban, which come mainly from the proceeds of
drug trafficking: it does not have any effect on the
Afghan nation itself.

The clause on humanitarian exceptions assures the
delivery of humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people,
because subparagraph (f) of paragraph 6 permits
consideration of requests for exemptions. We expect the
Security Council to use every mechanism at its disposal
for a meticulous and strict application of the sanctions by
all Member States and international agencies. This may
bring peace in Afghanistan.

The Islamic State of Afghanistan considers adoption
of today's draft resolution to be a means to persuade the
Taliban and their Pakistani mentors to abandon their
erroneous policies, which are harmful to the national
interests of Afghanistan and to peace and security in this
region of the world. And, when I say "this region of the
world", I include Pakistan as a part of that region.

The Taliban must be convinced that the current crisis
does not have a military solution. Afghan soil should not
be used as a safe haven for terrorists.
