The President: I will now make a statement in
my capacity as the representative of the United States.

The United States supports the Somalia
reconciliation process led by the Government of Kenya
under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority
on Development (IGAD). This reconciliation process is
central to the re-establishment of stability and effective
governance in Somalia. It is the Somali transitional
officials who are ultimately responsible for
establishing governance inside Somalia and in whose
hands the prospects for future stability and peace rest.

We urge the Transitional Federal President, Prime
Minister and Assembly to focus on the immediate task
at hand: the establishment of an effective Government,
operating inside Somalia. The ability of the
Transitional Federal Government to relocate to
Somalia will depend largely on an ongoing process of
reconciliation and on Somali officials' ability to reach
out to a wide range of individuals inside Somalia. The
transparent and inclusive selection of Government
officials and the development of a strategy and
timetable outlining the functional priorities of the
Transitional Federal Government are critical elements
of this task. After this strategy is presented, the
international community will be better able to
determine how best to support these efforts.

After 13 years, the possibility of re-establishing a
Government in Somalia may finally be on the horizon.
It will require sustained commitment, honesty and
good will from all Somalis. We urge all Somali
participants to focus on the needs of the Somali people,
while respecting the peace, governance and security
that exist in areas not currently participating in the
Somali National Reconciliation Conference.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

I now give the floor to His Excellency
Mr. Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, President of the Somali
Transitional Federal Government, to respond to
questions raised by Council members.
