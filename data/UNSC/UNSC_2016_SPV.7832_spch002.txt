Mr. Safronkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We supported the adoption of resolution 2323
(2016), but we must recall that, during the discussions
on its elaboration, we strongly favoured extending
the mandate of the United Nations Support Mission
in Libya for six months. We believe that to be the
optimal time frame in the light of the weak political
dynamics in terms of the country's development, the
insufficient effectiveness of the work of the United
Nations Mission and the unclear prospects for its return
to the country. Sadly, that opinion was not heeded due
to the desire of certain Security Council members to
paint an unjustifiably optimistic picture of the situation
in Libya.
