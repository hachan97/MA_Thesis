Mr. Cardi (Italy): Italy believes that the work of the
International Commission of Inquiry established pursuant to
Security Council resolution 1013 (1995) has helped shed
light on a disturbing and threatening phenomenon: the flow
of arms in the Great Lakes region in violation of the arms
embargo imposed by the Security Council.

In this respect, the International Commission has been
instrumental in giving the Security Council a clearer and
more accurate picture of the actual flow of arms in the
region. In our View, this phenomenon represents one of the
most dangerous aspects of the overall instability in the area.

Italy is in favour of the Commission's continuing its
activities, on the basis set out in paragraph 91 (c) of the
report of the Secretary-General. In our opinion, it is clear
that the very existence of the Commission and its
presence in the region are a dissuasive factor in relation
to the arms flow.

The more visible the Commission's presence and the
more effective its investigations, the harder it will be to
disregard or violate the Security Council's resolutions.

In line with the European Union position, Italy
continues to believe that a comprehensive regional
conference on peace, security and development would
allow the international community and the countries of
the region to address the main causes of instability in the
Great Lakes area.

Italy feels that the draft resolution that the Council
is about to vote on addresses our concerns over the need
to adopt effective measures to prevent destabilizing
activities in the Great Lakes region, and will therefore
vote in favour of its adoption.
