The President: I should note, for the benefit of
colleagues and those who intend to speak, that I have
been asked about our intention regarding the conduct
of the rest of the meeting, given the growing lateness
of the hour. I intend to finish the meeting this morning,
so we will continue straight through, and I ask those
who are speaking to take a look at their presentations to
see if there is a way in which they could be made more

pithy.
