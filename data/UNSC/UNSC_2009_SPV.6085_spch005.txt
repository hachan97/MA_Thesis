The President: I thank President Ramos-Horta
for an inspiring statement. The Council thanks him for
his notice that the United Nations has upheld such a
high standing and is very grateful for that.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers
to limit their statement to no more than five minutes in
order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations that will take the floor with
a lengthy statement are kindly requested to circulate
the text in writing and to deliver a condensed version
when speaking in the Chamber.
