The President: The Security Council will now

begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

After consultations among Council members, I

have been authorized to make the following statement
on their behalf:

"The Security Council expresses grave concern
about reports of migrants being sold into slavery
in Libya. The Security Council condemns such
actions as heinous abuses of human rights which
may also amount to crimes against humanity. The
Security Council calls upon all relevant authorities
to investigate such activities without delay to
bring the perpetrators to justice and hold those
responsible to account.

"The Security Council welcomes in this regard
the statement by the Presidency Council of the
Government of National Accord (GNA) of Libya
denouncing trafficking in persons, including for
the purpose of slavery, inside or outside Libya, and
notes that the GNA has launched an investigation
into the reported incidents and committed to hold
those responsible for these actions to account.
The Council also welcomes the statements by
the African Union calling for an immediate end
to these practices and welcomes the Secretary-
General's request for the relevant United Nations
actors to actively pursue this matter.

"The Security Council reaffirms its support
for the United Nations action plan for Libya,
reiterates its call for all Libyans to work together
in a spirit of compromise in the inclusive political
process facilitated by Special Representative
of the Secretary-General Ghassan Salame', and
emphasizes that a stable Libya is the only way to
help improve the living conditions of all people in
Libya, including migrants.

"The Security Council reiterates concern at the
smuggling of migrants and trafficking in persons,
including through Libya, and welcomes the work
of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya
(UNSMIL) in coordinating and supporting the

provision of humanitarian assistance for refugees
and migrants through the United Nations country
team, particularly the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the
International Organization for Migration (IOM).

"The Security Council further underlines the
need for coordination of efforts to tackle the root
causes of large movements of people, including
forced displacement, unmanaged migration and
trafficking in persons, in a comprehensive and
holistic manner, to prevent exploitation of refugees
and migrants by smugglers and human traffickers,
as well as for implementation of the 2030 Agenda.

"The Security Council underlines the
importance of a comprehensive response for all
migrants in Libya and strengthened international
cooperation with the Libyan authorities.

"The Security Council emphasizes that all
migrants should be treated with humanity and
dignity and that their rights should be fully
respected, and urges the Libyan authorities and
all Member States in this regard to comply with
their obligations under international law, including
international human rights law and international
refugee law, as applicable.

"The Security Council stresses the need
to transfer detainees to State authorities and
encourages the Libyan authorities to reinforce their
cooperation with international organizations and
United Nations agencies and to ensure humanitarian
access to detention centres.

"The Security Council recalls its resolution
1970 (2011) and notes that individuals and entities
planning, directing, or committing acts that
violate applicable international human rights law
or international humanitarian law, or acts that
constitute human rights abuses in Libya, may be
subject to designation by the Sanctions committee
established by resolution 1970 (2011).

"The Security Council also reiterates concern
at the implications for regional stability posed by
transnational organized crime and illicit activities,
such as trafficking in persons and the smugg1ing of
migrants, and calls upon Member States to step up
their efforts to investigate, disrupt and dismantle
networks engaging in trafficking in persons in
areas affected by armed conflict and to take all
appropriate measures to collect, preserve and
store evidence of human trafficking to help hold
those responsible accountable, and assist victims
of human trafficking, and in this regard calls on
the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime,
within its existing mandates, to provide technical
assistance to Member States on their request.

"The Security Council further recalls its
resolutions 2331 (2016) and 2388 (2017), on
trafficking of persons in conflict situations, which
recognize that the various forms of exploitation can
include slavery and practices similar to slavery. The
Security Council also reiterates its call to Member
States to consider, as a matter of priority, ratifying
or acceding to, and for States Parties to effectively
implement, the United Nations Convention
against Transnational Organized Crime and its
supplementary Protocols, in particular the Protocol
to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in
Persons Especially Women and Children, and the
Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by
Land, Sea and Air.

"The Security Council calls on all Member
States to implement effectively the United Nations
Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking
in Persons and for the United Nations to step up
its efforts including through the Inter-Agency
Coordination Group Against Trafficking in Persons.

"The Security Council encourages cooperation
between the European Union, the African Union
and the United Nations to protect the lives of
migrants and refugees along migration routes, and
in particular inside Libya.

"The Security Council further reiterates
the need to place prevention and protection of
Victims of trafficking, including for the purpose
of slavery, at the centre of the national and
international response, including through the
strengthening of identification, registration, gender
and age-sensitive assistance, and services for the
physical, psychological and social recovery care
of those who are victims of trafficking, as well as
to strengthen Member States' and United Nations
assessment, where appropriate, of those who are
vulnerable to trafficking in persons, and further
encourages Member States, especially transit and
destination States, to develop and use early warning
and early screening frameworks.

"The Security Council welcomes ongoing
efforts by Members States and regional
organizations to assist Libya, on request, in
building capacity, including to secure its borders
and to prevent, investigate and prosecute acts of
smuggling of migrants and trafficking in persons
through its territory and in its territorial seas, and
calls on Member States and regional organizations
to continue to do so, in partnership with the
Presidency Council of the Government of National
Accord of Libya and in support of the United
Nations country team, in particular UNHCR and
IOM, while reaffirming its strong commitment to
the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity
and national unity of Libya."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2017/24.

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements.
