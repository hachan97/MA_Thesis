The President: I thank Mr. Takasu for his
statement.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to ask all speakers to
limit their statements to no more than five minutes in
order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate their texts in writing and
to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.
