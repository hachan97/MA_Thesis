The President: As this is the last scheduled meeting
of the Council for the month of March, I would like
to express the sincere appreciation of the delegation
of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to the members of
the Council, especially the Permanent Representatives
and their respective staff, and to the secretariat of the
Council for all the support they have given us.

Indeed, it has been a busy month and one in which
we have rallied to consensus on several important
issues within our purview. We could not have done it
alone or without the hard work, support and positive
contributions of every delegation and the representatives
of the Secretariat, as well as all relevant conference
service officers, interpreters 4 who have done a
tremendous job - and security staff. We are very
grateful for all their tireless support, professionalism
and flexibility. They are always there for us and we
can always count on all of them, including the media
services. It is really tremendous how many people are
here to help the presidency do a good job. I offer them
all a very heartfelt thank you.

As we end our presidency, I know I speak on behalf
of the Council in wishing the delegation of Peru good
luck in the month of April.

The meeting rose at 6.20 pm.
