The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the
Secretary-General for his statement, the information he
has provided and his kind words addressed to
Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, which I am sure we all share.

At this meeting the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, Special
Representative of the Secretary-General for
Afghanistan. As this is the last time Mr. Brahimi will
deliver a briefing in that capacity, I wish to take this
opportunity on behalf of all the members of the
Council to pay a well deserved tribute to him for his
outstanding contributions to the cause of peace and the
promotion of democracy in Afghanistan. With his
persistence, patience, determination and integrity,
Mr. Brahimi has been able to carry out successfully a
number of United Nations missions, ranging from the
former Zaire to Afghanistan. With respect to that latter
mission, the members of the Security Council have all
been witness to the appreciation and gratefulness of the
people of Afghanistan and their authorities for
Mr. Brahimi's enormous contribution during his time in
Afghanistan. All members of the Council wish him the
greatest success in the endeavours he undertakes in
future.

I now give the floor to Mr. Brahimi, Special
Representative of the Secretary-General for
Afghanistan.
