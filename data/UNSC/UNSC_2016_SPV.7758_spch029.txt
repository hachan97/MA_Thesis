The President: I wish to remind all speakers to
limit their statement to no more than four minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements
are kindly requested to circulate their texts in writing
and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in
the Chamber.

I would also like to appeal to speakers to deliver
their statements at a reasonable speed in order that
interpretation may be provided accurately.

I wish to inform all concerned that, given the long
list of speakers, we will be carrying on the open debate
right through the lunch hour.

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Miroslav
Lajcak, Minister for Foreign and European Affairs
of Slovakia.
