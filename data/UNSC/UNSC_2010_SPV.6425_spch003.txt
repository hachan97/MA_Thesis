The President: I thank the Secretary-General for
his statement.

I am now hoping to give the floor to Mr. Thabo
Mbeki, Chairperson of the African Union High-Level
Implementation Panel for Sudan. We cannot see him on
the screen since there has been a power failure in
Johannesburg, but I believe he can hear us and that we
may be able to hear him.
