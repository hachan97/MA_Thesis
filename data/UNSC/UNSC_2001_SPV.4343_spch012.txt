Mr. Levitte: (France) (spoke in French) Given
the hour, I too will be very brief. Bravo, Mr. President,
bravo to you, bravo to your entire delegation. You
made us work a lot during the month of June, but above
all, you made us work effectively, and that is due to
your talent. Just one example for today was the
resolution on the Western Sahara, which is the very
delicate balancing point which we were able all
together to find, thanks to you and thanks to your last
proposal this morning, which allowed us to meet here,
as David Cooney said, at an important time.

It has very often been said that the Security
Council is slow or indeed even lags behind events. I
think that from that point of view we are making
progress; thanks to you we even sometimes manage to
get ahead of our timetable, for we have recommended a
second term of office for our favourite Secretary-
General six months ahead of the official timetable.

I agree with David Cooney when he suggests new
meetings - not necessarily at Pocantico but certainly
of the brainstorming-type a not just to prepare for the
coming event, but also to ensure regular follow up for
those issues that deserve that. I am referring to
Burundi, which was also referred to by Christine Lee. I
am also thinking of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo and several other items which merit having the
Council return to them at least once a month and taking
all the time necessary for real deliberations with the
Secretary-General, the Secretariat and all those who
can assist us in properly defining the stages, the
necessary initiatives and the steps to be taken.

I think that every time we consider the timetable
of the coming month, we should all reserve a few hours
for one or two issues in order to think together about
appropriate initiatives.
