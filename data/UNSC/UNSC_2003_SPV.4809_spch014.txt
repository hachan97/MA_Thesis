Mr. Cheng Jingye (China) (spoke in Chinese):
The Chinese delegation welcomes the presence of
Deputy Prime Minister Covic of the Republic of Serbia
to brief the Security Council on the situation in
Kosovo. I listened attentively to his statement.

The Chinese delegation was deeply shocked by
the shooting incident that occurred in the Pec region on
13 August, resulting in the deaths of two Serb children
and the serious injury of four others. We strongly
condemn this violence and urge that efforts be made
immediately to investigate the incident and to bring the
perpetrators to justice.

Recently, the Kosovo region has been troubled by
rampant terrorist activities and a series of violent
incidents. We are deeply concerned by these
developments in the situation. The tragedy of 13
August demonstrates yet again that, although it has
been four years since the Security Council adopted
resolution 1244 (1999), achieving peace, stability and
multi-ethnic peaceful coexistence in Kosovo remains a
long and arduous task.

We urge the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the
Provisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo
to take effective measures to strengthen the
establishment of the rule of law in Kosovo, to improve
the security situation there and thereby to prevent such
violence from reoccurring.

Resolution 1244 (1999) established the
foundations for resolving the issue of Kosovo. In order
to guarantee the legitimate rights and interests of all
ethnic groups in Kosovo and to promote the ultimate
settlement of the issue of Kosovo, it is necessary that
the Government of Serbia and Montenegro and the
Provisional Institutions of Kosovo undertake political
dialogue as soon as possible. To that end, the
international community should provide active support.
