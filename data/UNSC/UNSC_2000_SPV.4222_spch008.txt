Miss Moglia (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): I
should like to express my thanks to the Under-
Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations,
Mr. Guehenno, for the very detailed information he has
given us.

The fact that elections were held in Bosnia and
Herzegovina on 11 November is, in our opinion, a
valuable tool that can be used in strengthening
democracy. We are pleased that the elections were
carried out in an orderly manner, respecting secret
balloting and without any violence. However, there
were incidents during the electoral campaign, including
speeches and declarations encouraging hatred, as well
as a referendum having no legal basis whatsoever,
clearly indicating that the Council and the international
community as whole must follow very carefully
developments in Bosnia and Herzegovina to ensure that
the Dayton Accords are fully implemented.
