The President (interpretation from Arabic): I thank
the representative of Sweden for his most insightful
statement, which reflected his full knowledge of the
situation in Sierra Leone. He spoke of the civil war in that
country and of its implications in terms of the problems
faced by the people of Sierra Leone, especially children -
a matter which makes it particularly urgent that we tackle
the security situation there, along with the problem of
refugees and displaced persons, by putting in place an
effective humanitarian assistance programme and
endeavouring to find a peaceful resolution of the situation.
I thank him also for highlighting the linkage between the
situations in Sierra Leone and in Liberia.
