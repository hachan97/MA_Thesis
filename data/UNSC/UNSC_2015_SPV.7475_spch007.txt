Mr. Mendez Graterol (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The delegation of the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela voted in favour of
resolution 2228 (2015), as we believe that the African
Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur
(UNAMID), in coordination with the Government of
the Sudan, plays an important role in the strategy aimed
at achieving peace and stability in Darfur, including the
protection of civilians, in accordance with the mandate
of that mission.

We welcome the role of UNAMID in promoting
peace and stability in Darfur within the framework of
the search for sustainable and peaceful solutions to the
conflict, with the full participation of the parties and
the support of regional and subregional partners. In that
vein, we express our full support for the implementation
of the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur, which
provides a framework that could serve as a basis for
negotiations between the parties to the conflict.

Lastly, we hope that the joint working group will
soon resume its discussions on a road map for the gradual
transfer of the tasks of UNAMID to the Government in

Khartoum and the United Nations country team in the
Sudan, for presentation to the Security Council and the
African Union Peace and Security Council.
