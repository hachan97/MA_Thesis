The President: I thank the Assistant Secretary-
General for adding that useful detail.

On the tax problem for non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), it is not the Council's business,
but it would be of concern to the Security Council if
NGOs were deterred from wanting to work in East
Timor because the regulations there were less
advantageous than in other parts of the world where
they work. I hope that the United Nations Transitional
Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) and the
Special Representative will try to resolve that problem
as amicably as possible. Please convey that to
UNTAET.
