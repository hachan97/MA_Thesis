Mr. Corr (Ireland): Ireland supported the draft
resolution presented by Syria on behalf of the Arab
group because we considered it appropriate that the
Council address the important issues raised in the draft
resolution. We also consider it appropriate and
important that the Council condemn the recent killings
of international staff and the deliberate destruction of a
food warehouse and its contents at a time when the
population of Gaza is finding it so difficult to survive.

We also supported the draft resolution because we

consider it fully appropriate also to remind Israel of the
need to fully respect international humanitarian law. It
is obliged to fully respect the provisions of the Fourth
Geneva Convention which applies in the occupied
territories.
