The President: Allow me to extend our condolences
to our friends in Egypt. What we saw happen was
devastating because it happened in the most sacred of
places, where people go to feel safe, to feel comfort
and to find peace. Our thoughts and prayers are with
all of the people of Egypt, and we stand in mourning
with them.
