Mr. Yao Shaojun (China) (spoke in Chinese):
The Security Council has just unanimously adopted
resolution 2500 (2019), renewing the authorizations for
States and regional organizations cooperating in the
fight against Somali pirates, which China welcomes.

In recent years, we have seen consistent progress
in the situation in Somalia and the Horn of Africa.
The absence of successful piracy attacks on merchant
ships off the coast of Somalia since March 2017 clearly
reflects the remarkable results that have been achieved
by the Federal Government of Somalia, the United
Nations and the international community in combating
piracy. However, we should also note that daunting
challenges remain in the political and security situation
in the Horn of Africa, and the piracy issue has not been
fundamentally resolved. The international community
should continue to strengthen cooperation, particularly
in terms of tackling the root causes of Somali piracy.

China has been actively participating in
international cooperation efforts against Somali pirates
since 2008. As of September, China had dispatched 33
formations to escort more than 6,700 ships with a View
to effectively ensuring regional peace and the safety
of important international trade routes. China will
continue to participate actively in relevant operations
so as to play a constructive role in the fight against
Somali pirates.

We note that in addition to the countries listed
in the resolution, Iran has also participated in escort
operations in the Gulf of Aden and Somali waters. The
Security Council should acknowledge its contributions.
