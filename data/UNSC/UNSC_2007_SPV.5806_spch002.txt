Mr. Biabaroh-Iboro (Congo) (spoke in French):
At this meeting devoted to the activities of subsidiary
bodies, I should like, before the end of my delegation's
chairmanship, to give Council members an overview of
the report of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Conflict
Prevention and Resolution in Africa, which Congo had
the honour to chair in 2006 and 2007.

I should like to recall that an interim report was
submitted last September, and thus I will be very brief,
2

mainly stressing the latest activities of the Ad Hoc
Group, in particular the seminar on the theme of an
effective global conflict prevention strategy in Africa,
the role of the Security Council.

After a slow start-up due to familiarization with
the issues, the Ad Hoc Working Group adopted, under
the chairmanship of Congo, a programme of work
structured around a simple approach: the organization
of interactive presentations with various actors
involved in conflict management, with a view to
convening a seminar on a global conflict resolution
strategy in Africa.

Over the past two years, a total of 17 meetings
were held by the Ad Hoc Working Group including
initial contacts and the preparations for and holding of
the seminar. As regards the presentations, the Group
heard five communications, on which we reported
during our presentation of the interim report on
27 August.

The seminar, which was held in accordance with
the provisions of resolution 1625 (2005) and the
presidential statement (S/PRST/2007/31) adopted on
28 August 2007 at the public debate held under the
presidency of the Congo on the item entitled
"Maintenance of international peace and security: the
role of the Security Council in conflict prevention and
resolution, in particular in Africa", followed up on the
first policy forum, organized under the chairmanship of
Benin, in June 2005, on the theme "Enhancing the
United Nations capacity for conflict prevention: the
role of the Security Council" (see S/2005/833). The
goal of the seminar was strengthening Security Council
action in conflict prevention in an approach stressing
the culture of prevention.

Throughout the process of preparing for the
seminar, the Ad Hoc Group benefited from the
assistance of the Office of the Special Adviser for
Africa and from the Department of Political Affairs,
whom I should like to thank.

The following themes were dealt with:
cooperation between the Security Council and the
United Nations system; opportunities for cooperation
among the Security Council, the African Union and
other partners; and cooperation with United Nations
intergovernmental bodies.

While the Working Group is still considering the
recommendations of the seminar, I should like to note
07-64646
that, on the basis of a set of questions adopted by the
Ad Hoc Working Group and following intensive
interactive discussions, the participants formulated the
following recommendations, among others: institute an
early warning mechanism enabling United Nations
bodies to act upstream rather than downstream and
strengthen those that exist at the regional and/or
subregional level; establish mechanisms allowing the
Security Council to react promptly to crisis situations;
give the Secretary-General a clearer mandate in terms
of preventive diplomacy; support coherently the role
played by the Secretary-General or his representatives
in preventive diplomacy through Security Council
decisions, resolutions and statements that are firm and
unanimous; give particular attention to disputes or
situations that could pose a threat to international
peace and security; send fact-finding missions to areas
at risk likely to pose a threat to international peace and
security, ensuring the involvement of the agencies of
the United Nations system working on the ground;
strengthen and improve existing partnerships between
the Security Council and regional and subregional
organizations, pursuant to Chapter VIII of the Charter;
and act on the root causes of conflicts in coordination
with other United Nations bodies.

In conclusion, I should just like to say that the
results achieved over the past two years by the Working
Group under the Congolese chairmanship, modest though
they may be, made it possible to refocus the debate on
the problems of conflict prevention, particularly in
Africa. On behalf of the members of the Ad Hoc
Working Group, the Congo expresses the hope that the
Council will pay close attention to the conclusions and
recommendations made at the seminar - which will be
annexed to the Group's report for 2006-2007 - with a
view to the appropriate decisions.
