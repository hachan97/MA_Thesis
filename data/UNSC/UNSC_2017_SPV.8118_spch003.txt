The President: I thank Mr. Feltman for his briefing.

I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the
Chair of the Security Council Committee established
pursuant to resolution 1718 (2006).

I have the honour to brief the Security Council on
the activities of the Committee established pursuant
to resolution 1718 (2006) during the period from
12 September 2017 to 29 November 2017, in accordance
with paragraph 12 (g) of that resolution. The Committee
strongly condemns the continuing Violations by the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in particular
the ballistic missile launch on 14 September, which
flew over Japan, and the launch on 28 November.

Following the adoption of resolution 2375 (2017),
on 11 September 2017, which significantly expanded
the scope of the sanctions regime, the Committee has
been engaged in facilitating the implementation of all
sanctions measures, continuing its efforts in that regard.

As part of the Committee's outreach activities, I
convened an open briefing with the United Nations
membership on 9 October to offer a detailed overview
of the expanded sanctions regime and Member States'
obligations in that regard. The briefing provided a
forum for Member States to explore challenges and
opportunities they faced and to raise specific questions
and concerns while implementing the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea sanctions. I also encouraged
them to submit their national implementation reports
on concrete measures they have taken to effectively
implement the resolutions.

As oftoday, the Committee has received 102, 89 and
31 national implementation reports on resolutions 2270
(2016), 2321 (2016), and 2371 (2017), respectively. While
this submission rate continues to be much higher than
under previous resolutions regarding the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea, it should be recalled that
resolution 2375 (2017) requires all Member States to
submit their national implementation reports within
90 days of its adoption, that is by 12 December 2017.

During the reporting period, the Committee
received notifications from Member States informing
the Committee of amendments to their national
legislation in order to ensure consistency with the
financial provisions ofresolutions 2321 (2016) and 2356
(2017), and continued to perform its duties through the
no-objection procedure envisioned by paragraph 5 (c)
of the guidelines of the committee for the conduct of
its work.

In that regard, on 12 September the Committee
approved updates to the informal list of individuals and
entities in the Korean language, which incorporated
the individuals and entities listed in annexes I and II
of resolution 2371 (2017). Following the adoption of
resolution 2375 (2017), the Committee approved, on
18 October, further updates to the informal list in the
Korean language, which incorporated the individuals
and entities listed in annexes I and II of that resolution.

With regard to the implementation of resolutions
2270 (2016), 2371 (2017) and 2375 (2017), I am pleased
to report that on 29 September the Committee agreed
on a list of items of concern related to weapons of
mass destruction, in accordance with paragraph 4 of
resolution 2375 (2017). On 2 October, the Committee
approved a list of conventional arms-related items - in
accordance with the requirements set out in paragraph
5 of resolution 2375 (2017) - and reported to the
Security Council. The Committee's deliberations are
ongoing with regard to updating the list of items related
to chemical and biological warfare.

I am also pleased to report that on 3 October, in
accordance with paragraph 6 of resolution 2375 (2017),
the Committee was able to reach an agreement on a list
of four vessels for designation, pursuant to the measures
imposed by paragraph 6 of resolution 2371 (2017).
With regard to the sanctions list pursuant to resolution
1718 (2006), the Committee approved, on 19 October,
a technical correction to an entity designated on that
sanctions list and is considering an intergovernmental
organization's requests pertaining to a designated
entity and an individual.

During the reporting period, the Committee
received an exemption request from one Member
State to allow one-time entry for the vessel PETREL 8
to the port of Donghae in the Republic of Korea. On
3 November, the Committee approved an exemption
to the measures imposed by paragraph 6 of resolution
2371 (2017) and resolution 2375 (2017). The Committee
continued to receive notifications on the implementation
of resolution 2270 (2016) relating to coal transportation
through the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,
solely for export from the port of Rajin. The Committee
was further notified of planned trans-shipments of coal
through the port of Rajin, in accordance with paragraph
8 of resolution 2371 (2017).

On 26 September, the Committee received a
notification from a Member State of imports of
iron ore, iron, lead ore, lead and seafood from the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea during the
period from 6 August to 4 September, in accordance
with paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 of resolution 2371 (2017).
During the reporting period, the Committee received
a number of notifications, including on training,
scientific cooperation and granting visas to nationals
of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to attend
meetings, and also determined whether those activities
were compliant with the sanctions regime.

The Committee continued its consideration of
proposals for assistance to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea from international organizations on a
range of issues, including the participation of nationals
of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in United
Nations regional meetings and programmes, as well
as an official country visit to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea to examine the implementation of
international drug control conventions, and intended
donations of information technology equipment.

I am also pleased to report that the Committee
concluded its deliberations on Implementation
Assistance Notice No.2 and a fact sheet, which
were approved on 3 November. On 15 November,
the Committee further approved Implementation
Assistance Notice No.1 and Implementation Assistance
Notice No.6. All of the updated Implementation
Assistance Notices and the fact sheet are available on
the Committee's website.

In conclusion, let me recall that the Panel of
Experts continued to investigate possible violations of
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea sanctions
regime and conducted a number of outreach activities,
a list of which is attached to the report as an annex.
Finally, while recalling that the primary responsibility
rests with Member States to implement the provisions
of resolutions 1718 (2006), 1874 (2009), 2087 (2013),
2094 (2013), 2270 (2016), 2321 (2016), 2356 (2017),
2371 (2017) and 2375 (2017), let me reassure the
Council that the Committee is committed to facilitating
the implementation of those measures, with a View to
contributing to a peaceful and comprehensive solution
to the issue of the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea.

As this is the last time that I will have the honour
to present to the Council the 90-day report on the
activities of the Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1718 (2006), I wish to thank all members of
the Council and their delegations for the support that
my team and I have received during my tenure, which I
am sure will also be provided to my successor.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements.
