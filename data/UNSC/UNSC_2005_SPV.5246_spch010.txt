Mr. Dumitru (Romania): On behalf of the
Romanian delegation to the Security Council, I am
particularly honoured to warmly welcome the new
Permanent Representative of the United States of
America to the United Nations, Ambassador John
Bolton. It is our determination to continue our close
cooperation with the United States delegation during
the next five months, the last leg of Romania's
membership in this body.

We have recently witnessed a worrisome and
troubling accumulation of terrorist acts in Iraq. One
can definitely speak of a critical mass of such
horrendous attacks that makes Council action
imperative. It is important that the Council send a
strong message of condemnation of such acts as well as
a message of solidarity with the people of Iraq in the
face of this threat.

It is for that reason that Romania, a country that
is itself actively participating in the effort to stabilize
Iraq and to ensure a successful political transition in
this sorely tried country, decided to co-sponsor this
resolution. In our View, the resolution is a timely
upgrade of Security Council action with regard to a
major item on its agenda. It is also the appropriate
answer to a formal request made by the legitimate
Government of Iraq itself. As Romania will continue to
participate in the international community's efforts to
help Iraq, we look forward to the full implementation
of the resolution.
