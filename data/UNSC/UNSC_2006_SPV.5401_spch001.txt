The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Lebanon in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Assaker
(Lebanon) took a seat at the Council table.

The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2006/ 176, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 6 of
resolution 1644 (2005).

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2006/l86, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by France, the United
Kingdom and the United States of America.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:

votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1664 (2006).

I give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Boutros
Assaker, Acting Secretary-General of the Lebanese
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants, who wishes
to make a statement.
