The President: As Minister Bishop said earlier, we
stand by Iraq in its fight against terrorism and violent
extremism, which is having such a serious impact in
Iraq. I thank the representative of Iraq for his very
important acknowledgment of the assistance that is
being provided by the international community to the
efforts in his country.

I now give the floor to the representative of Brazil.
