Sir John Weston (United Kingdom): I am sorry to
interrupt the normal proceedings, but I have to comment on
something the representative of Germany has just said. In
referring to Ambassador Fulci's statement, he said that he
was speaking on behalf of the European Union. I have the
statement of Ambassador Fulci in front of me, and he
nowhere claims in his statement to be speaking on behalf
of the European Union. He was careful to say that he was
speaking in his capacity as Presidency of the European
Union. That is because my own instructions did not permit
me to agree to his speaking on behalf of the European
Union, for reasons with which the German delegation is
familiar and which have nothing to do with the subject on
our agenda today.
