Mr. Llorentty Soliz (Plurinational State ofBolivia) (spoke in Spanish): Through you, Sir, I would like to
welcome His Excellency Mr. Marcel Amon Tanoh,
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cote d'Ivoire. It is a
genuine pleasure to have him present here today at this
meeting of the Security Council.

The Plurinational State of Bolivia welcomes the
briefing by the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General and Head of the United Nations Operation in
Cote d'Ivoire (UNOCI), Ms. Ai'chatou Mindaoudou.
We congratulate her on her excellent leadership and
also congratulate all civilian and military personnel for
their dedication to peace and stability.

I first wish to salute the efforts undertaken by the
people and Government of Cote d'Ivoire in favour of
national dialogue, peacebuilding and political unity.
Clear examples include the presidential elections held
on 25 October 2015, the constitutional referendum and
the legislative elections. We reaffirm resolution 2284
(2016), which extended - for the last time - the
mandate of UNOCI until 30 June, as a sign of the
positive progress achieved by the Government of Cote
d'Ivoire.

All countries have challenges that they must
face. In the case of Cote d'Ivoire, it is of course the
people and the Government of the Cote d'Ivoire, in
the framework of its sovereignty, independence and
territorial integrity, that must meet those challenges
in the framework of the democratic values of peace
and integration.
