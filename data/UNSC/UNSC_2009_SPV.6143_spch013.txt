Mr. Urbina (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish):
Costa Rica voted in favour of the draft resolution
presented by the Group of Friends in order to allow
more time for negotiation. We did so because, as I
stated during the informal consultations, there is
consensus among the members of the Council about
the positive role that the United Nations has played in
Georgia and a need for the presence of a United
Nations force in the future, as recommended by the
Secretary-General. Such a presence would provide
guarantees to the parties to the conflict and contribute
to creating the conditions for reconciliation and
cohabitation in Georgia.

Unfortunately, these fundamental agreements
were not sufficient to lead to a consensus making it
possible to extend the mandate of the mission in
Georgia. Costa Rica trusts that this disagreement will
not be an obstacle to the international community
maintaining its focus on Georgia and that it can prevent
the consolidation of the situation in Abkhazia and
Ossetia through measures that run counter to
international law.

As I have stated on other occasions, Costa Rica
takes as its guide the principles of international law,
the application of which is the only guarantee for our
own security. Our vote in favour of the draft resolution
also expresses our absolute opposition to any efforts to
ignore international law and our unconditional respect
for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
Republic of Georgia, as affirmed in all previous
resolutions of the Security Council.
