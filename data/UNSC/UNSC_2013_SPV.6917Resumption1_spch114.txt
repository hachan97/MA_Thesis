Mr. Musayev (Azerbaijan): It is curious, to say the
least, that the representative of Armenia, the country
that bears primary responsibility for unleashing the
war against Azerbaijan, committing other serious
crimes during the conflict and failing to comply with
the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, takes
the floor in the Council and tries to lecture others about
such notions as peace and human rights.

My delegation will circulate a written response
containing detailed information on what the
representative of Armenia preferred to pass over in
silence and what he deliberately distorted in his speech,

The position of my Government on the issue is well
known. We are ready to provide interested delegations
with all necessary documents and evidence, which
will afford them an opportunity to make their own
assessment and to draw conclusions about the hopeless
attempts made by Armenia to mislead the international
community.

Finally, I thought it would be pertinent, in the
context of the topic of today's debate, to recall what
the current President of Armenia, Serzh Sargsyan,
said about his own role in the massacres committed
against Azerbaijani civilians during the conflict. In his
answer to British journalist Thomas de Waal's question
as to whether he had any regrets about the deaths of
thousands of people, the President of Armenia said: "I
have absolutely no regrets, since such upheavals are
necessary, even ifthousands have to die". Those words,
coming from the person who holds the highest political
and military post in Armenia, speak for themselves
and make any statements on behalf of his Government
in the United Nations and other international forums
irrelevant and absurd.
