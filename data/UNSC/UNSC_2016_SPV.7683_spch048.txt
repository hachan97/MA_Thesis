The President (spoke in Chinese): The Russian
Federation has circulated the draft of a press statement.
Considering the situation in the Council, I propose
that after the meeting we continue to discuss the text
among relevant members. IfI hear no objection, it is so
decided.

The meeting rose at 5.40 pm.
