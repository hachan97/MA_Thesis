Mr. Pecsteen de Buytswerve (Belgium) (spoke in French): We fully align ourselves with the statement
delivered by the representative of Germany on behalf
of the three co-penholders before the vote. Allow me to
provide a few additional remarks.

I would like to begin by thanking those members
that voted in favour of our draft resolution (S/2019/96l).
If the quality of the Security Council's work is to
be measured by the number of lives saved, then no
other resolution is as important as the cross-border
resolution. As we all know, it is thanks to that mandate
that 4 million people receive humanitarian assistance,
and that assistance accounts for 41 per cent of total
assistance provided to Syria. As co-penholder of the
Syrian humanitarian dossier, we conducted an inclusive
and transparent drafting process for over a month. We
arrived at a compromise text that is balanced, clean and
strictly humanitarian and reflects the various points of

View expressed in the Council.

Furthermore, the draft resolution on the renewal
of cross-border assistance, as proposed by the
co-penholders, accurately reflects the situation on
the ground in Syria. It responds to a humanitarian
situation that has not changed and remains devastating
for millions of Syrians. No Syrian actor is at present
in a position to provide humanitarian assistance to all
the outlying regions in the country where the needs
are greatest.

Today is a sad day for the Council and for the
Syrian people. As co-penholder, we shall continue to
pursue a solution that allows for the continuation of this
important mechanism. Millions of people depend on it,
but we cannot compromise on the essentials.
