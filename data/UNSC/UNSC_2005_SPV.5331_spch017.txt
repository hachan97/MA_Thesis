Mr. Katti (Algeria) (spoke in French): I too
would also like to express appreciation to Mr. Egeland
for the detailed briefing he has just given us on some
of the most serious humanitarian crises in Africa. We
agree with him that a regional approach needs to be
adopted in order to deal with the humanitarian crises to
which he has just referred, given their cross-border
implications. The Lord's Resistance Army and the
refugee situation are examples of this.

I wish to make a few brief comments on
situations to which he referred in his briefing. I will
begin with Southern Africa, by welcoming the dialogue
with the Zimbabwean authorities that began during
Mr. Egeland's visit to that country and the agreements
arrived at during that visit. But I want to stress one
point to which he referred in his briefing: that
regardless of the circumstances, humanitarian
assistance must remain neutral and impartial and
should not be used as a political tool.

We believe that it is important to take a
coordinated approach towards the Lord's Resistance
Army. Mr. Egeland has made some suggestions that we
find interesting and which deserve further
consideration by the Security Council, in consultation
with the Governments concerned.

With respect to Darfur, we welcome a certain

stabilization of the situation, including the military
situation. The number of displaced persons has slightly
decreased. The malnutrition rate and the child
mortality rate have been reduced. That progress was
possible thanks to the mobilization of the international
community. But the situation clearly remains fragile,
because of the highly volatile security situation and the
lack of a political solution to the crisis. Restoring order
and security in Darfur will not be easy. However, it is
clear that the conclusion of a political agreement will
allow for a certain easing of tensions in the situation. It
is important to place pressure on the parties so that the
Abuja talks can lead to a lasting peace settlement.
