Mr. Clay (United Kingdom): The United Kingdom
was pleased to vote in favour today of resolution 2440
(2018), which supports the work of the Personal Envoy
of the Secretary-General for Western Sahara, Mr. Horst
Kohler, and rightly focuses on progress that must
be made towards a lasting and mutually acceptable
solution that will provide for the self-determination of
the people of Western Sahara.

The United Kingdom strongly supports the efforts
of Mr. Kohler, as well as the work of the United
Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara
(MINURSO) and its Head, Mr. Colin Stewart. We are
very grateful to our United States colleagues for their
efforts to ensure that the resolution sends a signal of the
Council's strong support for political progress, while
underpinning the important work of MINURSO.

The United Kingdom looks forward to the round
table talks in December, which will mark the start
of a process, and encourages all concerned to work
constructively with the Personal Envoy in the spirit
of compromise through the duration of the process to
ensure a successful outcome.
