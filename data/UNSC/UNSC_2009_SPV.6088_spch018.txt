Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): It seems to me that the exchange of views
that we have just heard between our French, Libyan
and Ugandan colleagues demonstrates that cooperation
between the Security Council and regional
organizations requires some fine-tuning.

With all due respect to the initiative proposed by
our French colleague, I do not believe that this is an
issue that should be left to the consideration of the
troika of France, Libya and Uganda alone. In the near
future, the Russian delegation will develop some
considerations on this issue, possibly to be shared in
the context of the Russian presidency of the Security
Council in May.
