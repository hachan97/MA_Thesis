Mr. Baja (Philippines): I also take this
opportunity to thank you, Mr. President, for this open
briefing and thank Ambassador Motoc as Chairman of
the Security Council Committee established pursuant
to resolution 1540 (2004) for its timely progress report
on the activities and decisions taken so far by the
Committee in implementing its mandate. Allow me just
to briefly note two points: first, it is important that the
general membership have ample opportunities to be
informed of developments in the work of the 1540
Committee in accordance with the spirit of utmost
transparency agreed upon by the Committee to
characterize the conduct of its work. These
opportunities will not only serve to keep Member
States abreast of what the 1540 Committee is doing,
but also sustain their interest in effectively
implementing the resolution.

At this stage, the Chairman's report focused on
the organizational activities of the 1540 Committee. As
the Committee commences consideration of the
national reports submitted, it would to be useful for
Member States to be regularly updated both on positive
developments, as well as on difficulties that may be
encountered by Member States in the implementation
of the resolution.

My second point is that my delegation welcomes
the 1540 Committee's approval of the recruitment of
the first four experts. We look forward to their early
appointment, to signal the start of the consideration of
national reports. As the reports continue to be
submitted and considered, my delegation fully supports
the decision taken by the Committee to invite further
nomination of experts in the necessary areas of
expertise, particularly from Asia and Africa. These are
the two regions where most developing countries are
situated, and the perspectives of their experts would
certainly be constructive and useful in the work of the
Committee and in effectively achieving the objectives
of resolution 1540 (2004).
