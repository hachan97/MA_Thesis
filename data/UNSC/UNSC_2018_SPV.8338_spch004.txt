Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian delegation voted in favour
of resolution 2433 (2018), regarding the renewal of
the mandate of the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL), taking into account, first and
foremost, the endorsement of the Lebanese side of the
new version of the text. That is a key principle of any
peacekeeping operation.

The activities of UNIFIL peacekeepers are having
a stabilizing effect not only along the Blue Line, which
separates Lebanon and Israel, but within the Lebanese
State itself and in the Middle East as a whole. We
highly value the work of the Tripartite Mechanism
in preventing and resolving incidents. That mission
should be preserved, and we should avoid attempts to
transform it into a politicized instrument. We must bear
in mind that peacekeepers are there to help Lebanese
State institutions, including security structures; they
are not there to replace them. We are convinced that
the further activities of this important peacekeeping
operation will be conducted while respectfully bearing
in mind the views of the Lebanese Government. Any
other approach would be unacceptable.
