The President: There are no more names inscribed
on the list of speakers.

As this is the last scheduled meeting of the Council
for the month of September, I would like to express
the sincere appreciation of the delegation of Ethiopia
to Council members, especially my colleagues the
Permanent Representatives and their respective staff,
and to the secretariat of the Council for all the support
they have given to us.

Indeed, it has been a busy month, in which we
have rallied to a consensus on several important
issues within our purview. We could not have done it
alone or without the hard work, support and positive
contribution of every delegation, the representatives
of the secretariat and all relevant conference service
officers, interpreters and translators.

As we end our presidency, I know I speak on behalf
of the Council in wishing the delegation of France good
luck in the month of October.

The meeting rose at 5.15 pm.
