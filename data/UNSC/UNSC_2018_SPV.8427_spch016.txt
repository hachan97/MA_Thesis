Mr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): We
would like to express our thanks for the convening of
this meeting and for the briefing by the Under-Secretary-
General for Peacekeeping Operations, Mr. Jean-Pierre
Lacroix. We would also like to welcome the presence of
the President of Serbia, Mr. Aleksandar Vueic', and the
President of Kosovo, Mr. Hashim Thaci.

Peru supports the peacebuilding process in Kosovo,
the normalization of relations between Pristina and
Belgrade and stability in the Balkan subregion. To that
end, we consider it paramount that all parties remain
committed to the fulfilment and implementation of
resolution 1244 (1999) and the Brussels agreements,
and that the Council remain united and attentive in the
exercise of its role as guarantor.

Last month, when the Council was considering
the legislative initiative concerning the transformation
of the Kosovo Security Force into a regular army
(see S/PV.8399), we expressed the need for careful
evaluation. We underline the need to take into account
the presence and role of the Kosovo Force, as well as the
impact of the measure on the political dialogue between
Pristina and Belgrade. In the same vein, we agree with
the Secretary-General that the three laws adopted by
the Kosovar Parliament are not in conformity with
resolution 1244 (1999) and the Brussels agreements,
which, as we recall, provided for the establishment of
an international security force led by NATO and of the
Kosovo Police Force, respectively. Peru calls on all
parties to exercise restraint with a View to promoting

detente and constructive dialogue, in accordance with
applicable international law and the principle of the
peaceful settlement of disputes.
