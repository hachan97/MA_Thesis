The President: I thank Judge Byron for his
comprehensive briefing. I want to assure him that the
Council takes due note of his requests, his appeals and
his remarks, as we have done with those of Judge
Pocar.

I now give the floor to Ms. Carla Del Ponte,
Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for
the Former Yugoslavia.
