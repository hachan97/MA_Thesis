Mr. Moncada (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): I hope that this is the last time I
take the floor. I would like to point out to Mr. Stein that
we have a letter that he himself signed that states that
he cannot come to Venezuela, despite our invitation,
because his mandate does not allow it. That is why we
made a formal complaint to the Office of the Secretary-
General, as we have a document that proves that he did
not want to meet. That is why we said that we have
proof in hand.

The meeting rose at 1.25 pm.
