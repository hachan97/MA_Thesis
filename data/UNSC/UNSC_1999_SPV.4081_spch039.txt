Mr. Holbrooke (United States): I want to praise you
for your comments and I want to make one important
explanation because, to a very considerable extent, we are
part of the reason for this delay in the United Nations
peacekeeping. I would just like to repeat to my dear
friend from South Africa what I said to President Mbeki
and President Mandela, President Mugabe, President
Museveni and President Kabila on this issue, and to stress
our country's situation.

It is true the Lusaka Agreement was signed on 10
July, and we will debate this in detail tomorrow, but it is
either being ignored or violated in every significant
provision. I want to reaffirm to you personally, as I did
to your President, that our country will support
peacekeeping. But we must get it right. Until a facilitator
is chosen, until the Joint Military Commission, the
Organization of African Unity and the United Nations go
in the direction which Ambassador Fonseca, Ambassador
Qin, Ambassador Dejammet and others have stressed,
toward the right relationship, we would be making a
mistake which could be disastrous for the future of the
United Nations and peacekeeping.

So I want to associate myself with your sentiments
and explain to you - so that no one in this room thinks
there is a real problem - that we will move in that
direction. But we need to get it right. I speak only for the
United States here, but that was the essence of the
message I carried on behalf of our country to ten nations
last week and which we will look forward to discussing
under the Presidency's direction in more detail tomorrow.
I wanted to respond on that immediately so that there
would be no misunderstanding between us and your great
country and you, personally.
