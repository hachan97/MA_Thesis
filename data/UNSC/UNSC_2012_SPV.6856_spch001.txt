The President: The Security Council will now
proceed to the consideration of its annual report to the
General Assembly, for the period from 1 August 2011 to
31 July 2012.

The draft report has been provided to members of
the Council. The introduction to the draft report was
prepared by the delegation of Colombia, as President of
the Council in July 2012, with the participation of the
other members of the Council. The body of the report
was prepared by the Secretariat. I should like to express
appreciation to Colombia and the Secretariat for their
respective contributions.

I should like to point out that the draft report was
prepared in accordance with the note by the President
of 26 July 2010 (S/2010/507).

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Nestor
Osorio, Permanent Representative of Colombia, in
his capacity as head of the delegation responsible for
drafting the introduction to this year's annual report.
