Mr. Takasu (Japan): This is the tenth 90-day
report to the Security Council in accordance with
paragraph 18 (h) of resolution 1737 (2006). The report
covers the period from 11 March 2009 to 15 June 2009,
during which time the Committee held no meetings but
conducted its work using the silence procedure.

In the previous report, I informed the Council
that the Committee had sent letters to concerned
Member States inviting them to provide within 10
working days any additional relevant information
regarding the transfer of materiel that constituted a
violation of paragraph 5 of resolution 1737 (2006).
That paragraph sets out a ban on the export of arms and
related materiel to the Islamic Republic of Iran. The
Committee subsequently received a response from one
of the two States, which, however, did not provide any
information relevant to such transfers. The Committee
therefore sent a second letter to both States on 1 May
2009, reiterating its request. The Committee also
received on 27 March and 26 May, respectively,
additional details on materiel from States that had first
brought the matter to the Committee's attention. This
information is currently under review by the
Committee.

During the reporting period, the Committee
received a notification from a Member State making
reference to paragraph 5 of resolution 1737 (2006) and
concerning the delivery of items for use in the nuclear
power plant in Bushehr, Iran. The Committee also
2

received notification pursuant to paragraph 15 of
resolution 1737 (2006) in connection with the
unfreezing of funds to make payment for contracts
entered into prior to the listing of the entity. The
Committee also responded to written queries from
Member States concerning certain aspects of the
sanctions regime.

Finally, with regard to reporting by States on the
implementation of all relevant measures set out in
resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007) and 1803 (2008),
the updated figures are as follows: 91 reports under
resolution 1737 (2006), 78 reports under resolution
1747 (2007) and 66 reports under resolution 1803
(2008).
