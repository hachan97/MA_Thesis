The President: I thank the Secretary-General for
his kind words addressed to me.

I have no doubt that the participants in the debate
will reflect on the proposals and questions that the
Secretary-General has put before us.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Canada. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
