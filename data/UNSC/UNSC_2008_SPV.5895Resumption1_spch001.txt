The President: I wish to remind all speakers to
limit their statements to within five minutes so that the
Council can carry out its work expeditiously.
Delegations with statements likely to be longer than
five minutes are invited to circulate the texts in writing
and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in
the Chamber.

I now give the floor to Mr. Yukio Takasu,
Chairman of the Peacebuilding Commission and
Permanent Representative of Japan.
