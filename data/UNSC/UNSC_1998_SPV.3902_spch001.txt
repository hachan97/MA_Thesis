The President (interpretation from Russian): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Austria, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, in
which they request to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives to
participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Khyne-Sam
( Sierra Leone) took a seat at the Council table; Mr.
Manz (Austria) and Mr. Gambari (Nigeria) took the
seats reserved for them at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The President (interpretation from Russian): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the fifth
report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Sierra
Leone, document 5/1998/486 and Add.1. Members of the
Council also have before them document S/1998/620, which
contains the text of a draft resolution prepared in the course
of the Council's prior consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to document 8/1998/629, which contains the
text of a letter dated 10 July 1998 from the Permanent
Representative of Nigeria to the United Nations addressed
to the President of the Security Council.

The first speaker on my list is the representative of
Austria. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and
to make his statement.
