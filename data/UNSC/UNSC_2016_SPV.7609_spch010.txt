Mr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): Ukraine is very
pleased to see that the Colombian Government and
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia have
achieved major breakthroughs in the peace process
negotiations. We welcome the agreements reached by
the sides on transitional justice, the laying down of
arms and a timetable for signing a final agreement.

The peace talks in Havana brought historic progress
toward a final peace agreement to put an end to the
more than 50-year-old armed conflict in Colombia,
the longest in Latin America. We applaud the fact that
peace is now closer than ever for the Colombian people.
They deserve ajust and durable peace.

We also underline the important roles played by
Norway and Cuba as guarantors of the peace process,
as well as Chile and Venezuela as accompanying
countries.

In the spirit of strong support for the peace process
in the Republic of Colombia, Ukraine welcomes
resolution 2261 (2016), adopted today, and was glad to
co-sponsor this historic document. We also express our
appreciation to the British delegation for its leadership
in preparing the draft and in conducting the negotiations
that led to its successful adoption.

This decision will contribute to the strengthening of
the role of the United Nations in peacebuilding in post-
conflict situations and will provide the support required
to advance peace, human rights and development for all
citizens in Colombia.

We believe that the Colombian initiative to engage
the United Nations as the international component of
the tripartite mechanism will be a success story and
help to bring stability to the region. This experience
should be followed and replicated where applicable.
