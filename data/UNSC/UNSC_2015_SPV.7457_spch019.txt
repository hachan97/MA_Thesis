Mrs. ngu (Nigeria): I would like to thank
Mr. Feltman,Under-Secretary-General, and Mr. Hug,
Deputy Chief Monitor for the Organization for Security

and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), for their very lucid
briefings.

The recent escalation of fighting in eastern Ukraine
is very disturbing, as we have all heard from members
of the Council this morning. Reports of the large-scale
offensive by separatists in Marinka on 4 June, which
resulted in the deaths of over 20 persons, underscores
the fragility of the situation. There is a risk that the
ceasefire of February 2015 may totally collapse if
the unrelenting violations persist. We urge both sides
to take deliberate and concrete steps to de-escalate
the situation. We all agree that the fulcrum of such a
de-escalation is the Minsk agreement. Indeed, it was
designed to stabilize the situation. It is therefore vital
that the parties act in accordance with their obligations
under the Minsk agreement.

Need we reiterate at this point, in the Council, that
a military solution to this crisis is unattainable? We
would like to encourage both sides to work diligently
and move purposefully towards achieving a political
settlement that is negotiated, with justice and peace
as the guiding principles. We would like to see the
conflict resolved in a manner that takes into account
the concerns of the separatists while unreservedly
respecting the territorial integrity, independence and
sovereignty of Ukraine.

We would like to pay tribute this morning to the
leadership and staff of the OSCE Special Monitoring
Mission for their unrelenting efforts in monitoring
the ceasefire. The regular media updates by the
Mission have enabled us to follow closely not only its
achievements but also the challenges it encounters. We
encourage the parties and all stakeholders to continue
to give their full cooperation to the Mission to facilitate
its very essential role.
