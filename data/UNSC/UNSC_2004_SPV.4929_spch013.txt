Mr. Gatilov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation is deeply alarmed by
the dangerous turn of events in the Palestinian
territories. The lengthy Palestinian-Israeli conflict has
cost thousands of lives. It has had a destabilizing
impact on the situation throughout the region. We once
again earnestly emphasize the deleterious effect of
unilateral steps leading to the further escalation of the
tension stemming from an Israel military operation that
resulted in the killing of the spiritual leader of Hamas,
Ahmed Yassin. This situation has aroused serious
concern. Israel has the right to self-defence and to
protect its citizens, but this right must be implemented
in accordance with international humanitarian norms.

Russia opposes the targeted killings of
Palestinians, the practice of extrajudicial retaliation
and the disproportionate use of force in densely
populated areas. Russia condemns terrorism in all its
forms and manifestations. The actions of extremists
cannot be condoned. The Palestinian Authority must
undertake vigorous measures to curb the terrorists so as
to deter attacks on the civilian Israeli population.

We call on both parties to prevent a new wave of
violence from wiping out the efforts to resume the
negotiating process undertaken by the Quartet of
international mediators and the key parties in the
region. Only the joint work of Israel and the Palestinian
Authority, using the road map as its platform, as
adopted in Security Council resolution 1515 (2003), is
capable of creating the necessary conditions for a
lasting settlement of the conflict that can lead to the
coexistence of two States, Israel and Palestine, within
secure and recognized borders.

As an active participant in the Quartet of
international mediators, Russia will continue to provide
active assistance to the parties to put an end to their
confrontation and establish a political dialogue so as to
achieve a lasting settlement in the Middle East.
