Mr. Malesky (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia): Allow me, Sir, to congratulate you on your
election as President of the Security Council for the month
of November and to share with you and the members of the
Council our joy and deep relief that the Balkan war is over.

The Government of the Republic of Macedonia
welcomes the success in Dayton, Ohio. The signing of the
Peace Agreement between the leaders of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia puts an end to nearly four years of
bloodshed that took many lives and caused vast destruction.

My Government commends the Government of the
United States of America, which demonstrated in practice
that when the leading Power gathers the will to lead, the
others will follow. We wish also to commend the efforts of
all the members of the Contact Group.

But even after the end of this war, fought in the
name of "ethnic purity", the Balkans remain an ethnically
mixed region where State borders do not follow ethnic
lines but cut across them. That is why today, celebrating
the end of yet another Balkan war, we are confronted
with the same old dilemma: how to live in peace with our
neighbours and with the minorities inside our States. Once
again, the question of security in the Balkans becomes a
question of democracy, tolerance, pluralism and
cooperation inside and between States.
The alternative continues to be the most brutal and
senseless military conflict humanity is experiencing
today - ethnic wars. It is up to the peoples of the
Balkans to make the choice - and this time the
Bosnians, the Croats and the Serbs have made the right
choice in Dayton.
