Mr. Le Roy (spoke in French): I would to
address just a few brief words of thanks to all
delegations for their support for the report of the
Secretary-General (S/2009/470), on support for the
United Nations-authorized African Union peacekeeping
operations. While not repeating what he said, I think
that the framework provided by Mr. Prodi was very
significant.

For our part, we remain firmly committed to
working with the African Union, and its Commission in
particular, to update the Security Council by next April
and, by then, to set up the joint United Nations-African
Union Commission task force and to restructure our
presence in Addis Ababa to be both more logical and
more cost-effective, as the representative of Japan also
requested.

Finally, as to the last element of our commitment,
I have been invited to participate three days hence in
the African Union Peace and Security Council summit
at the level of heads of State. Of course, I will be
present in Abuja in three days. I believe that at that
point we will discuss the Sudan and the Mbeki report.
This is yet another example of the ongoing
strengthened day-to-day cooperation between the
African Union Commission and the United Nations
Secretariat.
