Mr. Jiirgenson (Estonia): At the outset, I should like to thank the co-penholders for the immense amount of work they did and their persistence in truly fighting for the maintenance of the cross-border humanitarian mechanism first established by resolution 2165 (2014) more than five years ago. Belgium and Germany and, earlier, Kuwait worked closely to reach an outcome that aims to support Syrian civilians across the country. Over five years, millions of Syrians have received vital assistance. For that work, we thank the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and other United Nations agencies that despite hardships have continued to provide life-saving and life-sustaining aid to the people in urgent need inside Syria. Despite the numerous compromises made, the text provided by the co-penholders is a jump into the unknown. Even though the Al-Yarubiyah crossing is mentioned in the text, its future remains unclear. But what is even more important is that our colleagues leading these efforts did not resort to short-term political gains; instead, they put lives first - the lives of the Syrian people. At the same time, the Russian Federation did not engage in any serious discussion or offer any alternatives that would have granted humanitarian access to the north-east of Syria in a sustainable way. Taking this all into account, Estonia voted today with a heavy heart. We supported resolution 2504 (2020) in order to save millions of lives in Idlib, but we strongly voice our discontent at the way in which this result was achieved; instead of cooperation, the preferred means of negotiation by the Russian Federation were blackmail and presenting other parties with ultimatums. Finally, I would like to reiterate that the last-minute amendments to the resolution in no way change the principles of the mechanism that have existed thus far, and deliveries of humanitarian aid do not require the consent of the Syrian authorities.
