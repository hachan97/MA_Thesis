Mr. Mufioz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): Chile
resolutely supported this draft resolution, which has
now been adopted unanimously. My Government
believes that a vacuum exists in the international
system with respect to the proliferation and control of
weapons of mass destruction in relation to their
possible terrorist use by non-State actors. It therefore
devolves to the Security Council to act in a prompt and
timely manner by taking appropriate steps within the
framework of the powers entrusted to it by the Charter
for the maintenance of international peace and security,
as this initiative is, indeed, doing.

This issue has many aspects - political, legal
and technical - which must be taken into account in
order to achieve consensus and to satisfy the
requirements of different positions. My delegation
would have preferred greater emphasis on the inclusion
of disarmament aspects in the text, so as to reflect in a
more balanced manner the link between disarmament
and non-proliferation. Nonetheless, we gave priority to
the importance and timeliness of promoting effective
and universally applicable measures. However, we
would be in favour of negotiations, in the context of
appropriate international forums, on legally binding
instruments laying down the rules necessary to regulate
and enforce obligations.

Finally, the effective implementation of this
resolution and the positive results we expect from it
will depend on its general acceptance by the members
of the international community, which, in the final
analysis, are responsible for implementing it. We hope
that this will be the case.
