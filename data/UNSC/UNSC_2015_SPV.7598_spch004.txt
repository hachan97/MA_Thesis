Mr. Safronkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation supported the
adoption today of resolution 2259 (2015), guided by the
need to find an immediate way to restore the sovereignty,
unity, independence and territorial integrity of Libya.

We thank our partners for having taken into
account concerns about ensuring the broadly
representative nature of the Libyan political process.
Russian representatives are actively participating in
international efforts to assist the intra-Libyan political
process, including within the Rome format. We are
convinced that, as in other crises in the Middle East and
North Africa, international support must be genuinely
collective. External players have a heavy responsibility
to help the Libyans to achieve domestic stability, acting
on the basis of consolidated positions.

We expect the Libyans to begin as soon as possible
to implement the Agreement concluded with United
Nations mediation. In our View, the priority task is for
the future Government of National Accord to reach
agreement with all influential political forces on the
formation of robust and inclusive organs of power. We
express our support for efforts undertaken under the
auspices of the United Nations. We believe that the
mission of our global Organization is to cooperate with
all patriotic forces in achieving the fundamental task
of ensuring national reconciliation in Libyan. Libyan
problems can be resolved only by Libyans themselves.

We call on all sectors of Libyan society to join
ranks to eliminate the terrorist threat posed by the
Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and other terrorist
organizations that are exploiting the prevailing chaos
and anarchy for their own interests. Restoring stability
and unity in Libya will help us to resolve the important
task of promoting sustainable development, which is
in the interests of the Libyan people and all of North
Africa.
