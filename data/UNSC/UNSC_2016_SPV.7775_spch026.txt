Mr. Fesko (Ukraine): I would like to make a couple
of points in response to the Russian delegation.

First, let me remind all those present in the
Chamber, especially those who have conveniently
forgotten, of what happened two years ago. If it were
not for Russian weapons, the presence ofRussian troops
and the sustained effort to fuel a military conflict in
the Donbas region, we would not have to discuss the
downing of MH-17.

Secondly, Ukraine has cooperated fully with all
international partners on this issue. I do not think that
any party has anything to say about our readiness to
cooperate. There was an issue regarding access to the
MH-l7 crash site; access was blocked by people wearing
not the Ukrainian military uniform, but other military
uniforms. We insisted on immediate access right away,
but for whatever reason it did not happen.

Thirdly, last year the whole world witnessed Russia
veto the attempt to establish an international tribunal
on MH-17. Ukraine has nothing to hide. We want the
truth to become known, and we want the perpetrators
to be brought to justice; but somehow this effort has
foundered. Why? We all know how it happened. Quite
a few ofthe delegations here were also present last year.

Finally, on a different subject, we really appreciate
the Russian Federation establishing the new practice
of disclosing to the whole United Nations community,
in public in the Chamber, details of texts negotiated
by Council members. This is a positive step towards
implementing transparency, and we look forward to the
continuation of this practice on the Russian side.
