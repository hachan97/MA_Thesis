Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I would like to make a brief but important
clarification in response to the President's appeal:
maybe I was not correctly interpreted, or maybe I did
not say clearly enough what I meant in my statement.
The fact is that the agreement you referred to, that
you called for - our removal of the fighters - was
achieved a few hours ago, and it is being implemented.
The fighters, together with families and the wounded,
are leaving in the directions of their choosing, including
towards Idlib.

Over the past hour we have received information that
the military activities in eastern Aleppo have stopped.
There is no question about the cessation of hostilities or
humanitarian operations: the Syrian Government has
established control over eastern Aleppo and now the
time has come for practical humanitarian intitiatives.
The population that remains there should not need to
leave, although some civilians may indeed wish to leave
that destroyed city. But military actions have stopped.

This very difficult chapter relating to the situation in
eastern Aleppo has now ended. Let us hope that this will
indeed be a precondition for establishing the political
efforts to relaunch negotiations, as Mr. De Mistura
said recently. There should be large-scale humanitarian
support to eastern Aleppo, to those people who left the
city and those who remain there. Preconditions should
be established so that those who left the city will be
able to return to their homes as soon as possible.
