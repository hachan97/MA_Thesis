The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon, documents S/2004/572 and
S/2004/572/Add.l.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2004/599, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations.

I should also like to draw the attention of
members of the Council to documents S/2004/560,
S/2004/574, S/2004/575 and S/2004/577, which
contain letters from Lebanon; and document
S/2004/465, which contains a letter from Israel.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote of the draft resolution (5/2004/599)
before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the
draft resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1553 (2004).

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 11.25 am.
