Mr. Osorio (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I
have the honour today of providing the 90-day briefing
to the Security Council on the work of the Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1737 (2006), in
accordance with paragraph 18 (h) of that resolution.
The report covers the period from 22 March to 23 June
2011, during which time the Committee held two
informal consultations, on 8 and 16 June, and
conducted additional work using the no objection
procedure.

During the Committee's consultations held on
8 June, Ms. Salome Zourabichvili, Coordinator of the
Panel of Experts, provided an overview of the main
findings contained in the Panel's final report, which
was submitted to the Council and the Committee on
7 May, in accordance with paragraph 29 (d) of
resolution 1929 (2010). Due to time constraints,
Committee members had the opportunity only to make
general comments on the Panel's report.

On 16 June, the Committee discussed in depth the
Panel's recommendations. The Committee will
continue to consider actions to implement the
recommendations that enjoy consensus. As a way to
implement some of those recommendations, the
Committee decided to request the Panel of Experts to
draft a series of implementation assistance notices
based on the five thematic areas covered by the
recommendations.
During this period, in addition to submitting its
final report, the Panel, first, also held a series of
consultations in China, Qatar and Azerbaijan to discuss
issues relevant to the Panel's work; secondly,
investigated three reported violations, of paragraphs 9
and 13 of resolution 1929 (2010) and of paragraph 5 of
resolution 1747 (2007); and, thirdly, conducted
assessments of Member States' implementation reports
under paragraph 31 of resolution 1929 (2010), which
were circulated to the Committed on 3 May.

Since my last briefing to the Council (see S/PV.6502), the Committee was notified of three
additional cases of alleged violations of the provisions
of paragraph 5 of resolution 1747 (2007), which
imposes a ban on the export to and procurement by
Iran of arms and related materiel. Some of the cases
notified to the Committee are still being examined by
the Committee and the Panel of Experts. The
Committee commends the readiness of States to report
alleged sanctions violations and encourages them to
cooperate with the Panel of Experts in its
investigations of incidents of non-compliance.

During this reporting period, the Committee also
received five notifications: two from a Member State
with reference to paragraph 15 of resolution 1737
(2006) and paragraph 4 of resolution 1747 (2007),
concerning the authorization for exemptions from
financial restrictions; two from a Member State
announcing its intention to authorize, under paragraph
13 (b) of resolution 1737 (2006), certain economic
resources to the benefit of an entity included on the list
contained in the annex to resolution 1737 (2006); and,
finally, one from a Member State concerning the
authorization, under paragraph 15 of resolution 1737
(2006), of payments due under a contract entered into
prior to the Security Council measures against a certain
entity.

The Committee also received a query from a
Member State that sought information on whether there
were Security Council measures imposed against an
Iranian company or individuals working for that entity.
In response to a Committee letter asking for details
regarding an alleged violation previously reported, a
Member State asked for clarifications regarding its
involvement in the incident. The Committee is still
considering appropriate responses to those letters and
will provide answers in due course.

During this period, the Committee also received a
response to its previous request for clarifications from
the International Atomic Energy Agency.
