Mr. Fernandez-Taranco: Once again, since the
last briefing to the Council, presented by the Secretary-
General on 28 March, the situation regarding Ukraine
has seriously deteriorated. This is now the tenth time
that the Council has addressed the issue. The General
Assembly also took up the matter on 27 March (see A/68/PV.80).

Following close to two weeks of relative calm,
starting on 6 April armed individuals and separatist
groups began to seize Government buildings and
confiscate lethal weapons in Donetsk oblast of Ukraine,
including in the cities of Donetsk, Lugansk and
Kharkiv. The individuals involved called for secession
from Ukraine and for joining the Russian Federation. In
Donetsk, some of these individuals declared a People's
Republic of Donetsk.

It has now been reported that there have been at
least five new cities in eastern Ukraine targeted by
uprisings and seizures of Government buildings in
the past 24 hours, including the towns of Sloviansk,
Kramatorsk and Druzhkivka. United Nations monitors
have reported a consistent reinforcement of barricades
and armed civilians on both sides. They also sighted
armed militiamen with AK-47s, machine guns and
sniper rifles. United Nations monitors have also
reported duelling rallies in Kharkiv today, resulting in
injuries to some 50 persons. On the eve of 13 April,
authorities in Kyiv launched an "anti-terror" operation
to reclaim Sloviansk, a day after it was overrun by pro-
separatist activists, whom the United Nations human
rights monitors on the ground have described as well-
armed and well-organized militiamen.

As of 13 April, at least one Ukrainian officer has
been killed in a gun battle; however, the exact number
of casualties in the skirmishes remains unknown.
Numerous others have been reported wounded.
Also today, Ukraine's acting President, Oleksandr
Turchynov, signed a presidential decree, giving the
self-declared separatists until 6 am. Kyiv time to give
up their weapons in order to avoid prosecution. The
President further declared in a televised address to the
nation that if illegal activities were not halted, a full-
scale operation involving the Ukrainian army would be
launched.

The Russian Federation has publicly stated on
several occasions that it would be "forced to act" if
Kyiv were to employ force against demonstrators
in the East. The situation is therefore now more
combustible than ever. The Secretary-General and the
United Nations remain committed to the pursuit of a
peaceful solution to this ever-deepening crisis. The
Secretary-General has continued to speak out for the
exercise of maximum restraint by all concerned and
strict adherence to international law. He also continues
to urge all others with influence on the situation to
immediately and publicly call for restraint and a return
to calm. The Secretary-General further appeals for
direct and constructive dialogue between the parties,
and between Kyiv and Moscow, to de-escalate the
situation and address all differences.

It has become painfully evident that the Ukraine
crisis will continue to deepen if intensive efforts are
not urgently made by all concerned to de-escalate
the situation. At this moment, Ukraine teeters on the
very brink. However, it is not just Ukraine that will
suffer from a scenario where the likelihood of further
bloodshed and violent clashes grows by the hour. Russia,
which shares a long border area with Ukraine as well
as the broader European region, faces a spillover effect
of potentially severe consequences. Such scenarios
will also have repercussions for the entire international
community.
