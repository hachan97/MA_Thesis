Mr. Tanin (Afghanistan): I think we have had a
very important and constructive debate. We were all on
the mission, and we came back with a better
understanding of the situation in Afghanistan.

There has been an emphasis in all of our
statements today on how, in a short period of time -
that is, three months - Mr. De Mistura tried, after a
difficult year of elections and issues surrounding the
elections, to bring all the stakeholders together, to
establish a new dialogue with the Government of
Afghanistan, and to help the elements of the
international community to work together. I would like
again to express our gratitude for his work, which is
important and vital for Afghanistan.

I think the only comment I can make after all this
debate is that the Government of Afghanistan and the
Afghan people are continuing their partnership with the
international community. They know how vital are the
aid and assistance of the international community.
They are well aware of their own responsibilities. As I
said before, we would like to work together in this time
when it is important for all of us to succeed in
transitioning towards a new situation in which Afghans
will be at the centre in the defence of their country and
take on the responsibility of security, governance and
development of the country.

Here, the United Nations, as it has for all these
years, is playing an important role. We appreciate the
ideas that participants have raised today and will work
together with the Council and with all the
representatives of the international community who are
engaged towards a successful transition in Afghanistan.
