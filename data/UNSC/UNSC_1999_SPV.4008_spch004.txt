Mr. Burleigh (United States): The United States has
a deep and enduring interest in the welfare of Iraqi
citizens living under the regime of Saddam Hussein. We
took a leading role in shaping the oil-for-food programme
from its inception and note with satisfaction the
demonstrable success of this important humanitarian
effort. Accordingly, we are pleased to join consensus on
today's draft resolution extending the oil-for-food
programme in Iraq for a further six-month period. The
programme is the largest humanitarian assistance effort in
United Nations history, and it has brought about a
significant improvement in living conditions for Iraqi
civilians.

While the primary responsibility for meeting civilian
needs continues to reside with the Government of Iraq, it
is entirely appropriate that the United Nations act to
ensure that the benefits of Iraq's oil revenues be directed
to civilian needs. We note that the rise in world oil prices
has increased the level of available funding in recent
months, and we express again our willingness to see the
programme expand in response to humanitarian needs.

We commend the leadership of the office of the Iraq
programme in managing the oil-for-food programme and
call upon the Government of Iraq to cooperate fully with
the programme during the coming phase.

With regard to the no-fly zones, I associate the
United States completely with what Ambassador
Greenstock has just said with regard to the rationale for
the military action that is taken from time to time by the
United States Government.
