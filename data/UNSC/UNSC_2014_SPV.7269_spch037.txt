Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): I think
that the fact that the representative of the Russian
Federation has come to the Council on multiple
occasions and said things that have subsequently
proved to be untrue is relevant when we are discussing
his attitude towards this investigation. I will not repeat
all the things that my colleague from the United States
said in her initial statement, but all the statements
that Ambassador Churkin has made in the Council
about the fact that there were no additional Russian
forces in Crimea just before the military annexation
of Crimea, that there was no supply of weapons into
eastern Ukraine, that there was no training of eastern
Ukrainian separatists in Russia and that there were no
Russian troops in Ukraine have been demonstrated to
have been false statements.

However, let me just return to the subject of today's
discussion, which is the investigation. Ambassador
Churkin said to the press on 10 September, "I have
to conclude that a real international investigation did
not take place". If that is not trying to undermine this
independent credible investigation, I do not know what
is.
