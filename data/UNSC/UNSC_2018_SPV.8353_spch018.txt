The President: I shall now make a further
statement in my capacity as the representative of the
United States.

"Deny, distract and lie." We have heard that same
song many times before - whether it was aiding the
Al-Assad regime with chemical weapons, the attempted
murder of the Skripals with a dangerous nerve agent in
the United Kingdom, election-meddling in the United
States - which, by the way, did not work - or now
cheating on sanctions agreements and getting caught.
Lying, Cheating and rogue behaviour have become
the new norm of the Russian culture. The Russian
Ambassador said "no one is denying the Panel of
Experts". I take that to assume that he will allow the
original report of the Panel of Experts to be released.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

I give the floor to the representative of the Republic
of Korea.
