Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian delegation voted in favour of
resolution 2351 (2017), which extends the mandate
of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum
in Western Sahara. The Security Council's unified
position should serve to send to the sides in the Western
Sahara conflict a very strong signal with regard to the
need to begin to swiftly move towards resuming direct
talks between Morocco and the Polisario Front.

It is our view that overcoming antagonism and
achieving a fair and lasting solution is possible only
through political means in accordance with the relevant
resolutions of the Security Council.

The final formula must be acceptable to Morocco
as well as to the Polisario, and it must provide for the
self-determination of the peoples of Western Sahara in
the framework of the procedures in accordance with the
purposes and principles of the Charter of the United
Nations. In that context, we think it is important that
the new Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General
for Western Sahara do his utmost to resume the
political process.

In conclusion, allow me to underscore that the
persistent conflict in Western Sahara plays into the
hands of various extremist forces, which in turn has an
adverse impact on the military and political situation in
the entire region.
