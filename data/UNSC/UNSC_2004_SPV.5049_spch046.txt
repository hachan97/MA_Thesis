The President: There are no further speakers
inscribed on my list. I would note that the draft
resolution submitted by Algeria and Tunisia has been
circulated in the Chamber. My understanding is that it
has now gone into blue, and there will be a discussion
in consultations tomorrow at 4 pm. We will then
decide, in that light of that, how to proceed.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on the
agenda.

The meeting rose at 6.50 pm.
