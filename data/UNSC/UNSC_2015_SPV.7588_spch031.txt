The President: I want to take this occasion, on
behalf of Secretary Kerry, to thank all Council members
for moving very quickly today in pursuit of a unified
message to the world and unity for resolution 2254
(2015). I know it was not easy for many delegations, so
I offer the sincere gratitude of our delegation and all the
members of the International Syria Support Group who
worked on the resolution and sought to enshrine its key
provisions.

I now give the floor to the representative of the
Syrian Arab Republic.
