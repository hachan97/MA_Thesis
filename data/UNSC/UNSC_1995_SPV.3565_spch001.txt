The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

I would like to make the following statement on behalf
of the members of the Security Council:

"It was fifty years ago that the Asia-Pacific
region saw the end of the Second World War, a
devastating war that shattered the lives of tens of
millions of people in this region. On this solemn
occasion, we pay tribute to those who laid down their
lives and the other victims of the war.

"Having survived the catastrophe of the Second
World War, mankind sought to embrace new means
to prevent the recurrence of such a tragedy. To this
end, the United Nations was established, with
primary responsibility for the maintenance of
international peace and security conferred on the
Security Council by the Charter.

"Unity and harmony among nations would be
the most honourable and noble way to pay tribute to
those who sacrificed their lives for peace during the
Second World War. For this reason, it is appropriate
for the Security Council to pay homage on this
anniversary to all the victims of the Second World
War in the Asia-Pacific region."

May I now invite the members of the Council to
observe a minute of silence in memory of the victims of

the Second World War.

The members of the Security Council observed a
minute of silence.

The President: The Security Council has thus
concluded its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 11.30 am.
