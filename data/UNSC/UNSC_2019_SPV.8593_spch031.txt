Mr. Polyanskiy (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Frankly, I did not want to take the floor once
again, but after listening to the two statements made by
my United Kingdom colleague, I cannot help thinking
that she wants to demonstrate that there is unity within
the Council on the issues that she just brought up,
whereas her communication with the representative
of the Syrian Arab Republic was more akin to what a
prosecutor says to an accused person. We believe that
to be unacceptable.

In our own statement, we raised a number of
questions that she and her Western colleagues have yet
to answer. If we are to turn this meeting into a court
proceeding, as she is attempting to do, then the ones
who should be on trial are those who caused the country
to end up in its current state through their external
interference. I ask that this be borne in mind.

The meeting rose at 12.10p.m.
