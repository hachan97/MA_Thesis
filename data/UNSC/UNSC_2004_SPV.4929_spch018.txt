Mr. Adechi (Benin) (spoke in French): All States
Members of the United Nations subscribe to the rules
and principles of democracy and the rule of law. They
are also committed to respecting international law and
humanitarian law. The extrajudicial killing of Sheikh
Yassin is contrary to international law and undermines
the resumption of the peace process in the region.

We believe that all States in all circumstances
must act in keeping with international law, whose
principal goal is to ensure peace among nations and to
create a propitious framework for peaceful coexistence.
That is why we are outraged that the parties, under the
pressure of extremist and hard-line elements, seem to
have deliberately chosen to use killing, the destruction
of property and other attacks as a political tool.
Terrorism or response to terrorism: in all cases, it
means the death of innocent men, women and children,
mostly innocent civilians. The road map has no future
if the road is littered with corpses. One violation of the
law does not justify another.

We condemn the assassination of Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin and six other Palestinians. At the same time, we
urge the Palestinian people to resist calls to vengeance
and to keep open the path of peace.

It is essential that in this crisis the members of
the Quartet fully shoulder their responsibilities by
finding a way to bring the Palestinians and the Israelis
back to the negotiating table. It is up to them to work to
discourage escalation and confrontation.

The killing of innocent civilians in Israel and in
the occupied territories must be condemned. The
Palestinian territories must cease to be occupied. The
right of Israel to live within secure and recognized
borders must be protected. The Council must appeal to
all parties courageously to abide by their commitments.
