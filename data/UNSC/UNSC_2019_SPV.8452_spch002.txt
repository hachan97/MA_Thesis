Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation cannot support
the attempt of our American colleagues to conduct a
discussion of the situation in Venezuela. Generally
speaking, it is a gross abuse of the prerogatives of one
member of the Security Council - more importantly,
a permanent member - to introduce issues formulated
in this way to our agenda.

The internal situation in that Latin American
country is not an item on the agenda of the Council. We
see no external threats arising from what is taking place
in Venezuela. Venezuela does not represent a threat to
peace and security. If anything does represent a threat
to peace, it is the shameless and aggressive actions of
the United States and its allies aimed at ousting the
legitimately elected President of Venezuela.

Essentially, what we are seeing is an unceremonious
attempt by Washington, DC, to engineer a coup
d'etat in that country, in breach of all norms of
international law. This situation, concerning which
we will undoubtedly hear the views of the people of
Venezuela and Latin American States, and which the
Council should consider to be a threat to Venezuela,
leads us to request a procedural vote on the agenda
before us. We do not agree to discuss the item entitled
"Situation in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela",
all the more so as there is no such item on the agenda
of the Security Council. In our view, it would be more
appropriate to conduct a discussion on the agenda item
"Threats to international peace and security", in the
light of this violation of Article 2, paragraph 4, of the
Charter of the United Nations. We call on all who share
our point of view to support us.
