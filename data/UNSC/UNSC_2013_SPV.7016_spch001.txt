The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them the text
of a draft presidential statement on the subject of this
meeting. I am grateful to the members of Council for
their valuable contributions to the draft presidential
statement.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among the members of the Security Council, I shall
take it that members agree to the presidential statement,
which will be published as a document of the Council
under the symbol S/PRST/2013/13.

It is so decided.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 10.15 am.
