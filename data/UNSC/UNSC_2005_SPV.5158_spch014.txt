Mr. Denisov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The members of the Security Council have
frequently reaffirmed that the struggle against impunity
is one of the most important elements of a long-term
political settlement in Darfur and the Sudan as a whole.
All who are guilty of gross violations of human rights
in Darfur must be duly punished, as is rightly pointed
out in the report of the International Commission of
Inquiry.

We believe that the resolution adopted today by
the Security Council will contribute to an effective
solution in the fight against impunity in Darfur in the
context of providing for the normalization and stability
of the situation in that region of the Sudan.
