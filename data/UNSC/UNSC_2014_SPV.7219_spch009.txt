Ms. King (Australia): The downing of Malaysia
Airlines Flight MH-l7 in Ukrainian territory on 17 July
has shocked the world. We have witnessed the tragic
death of298 people. There were 28 Australians on board
Flight MH-17. Our nation is in mourning for all the
victims. The news that the lives of 80 children were lost
is devastating. Tomorrow, flags will be flown at half-
mast across Australia. We extend our heartfelt sympathy
and condolences to the families of all the victims of
the tragedy and to their countries of nationality. Our
particular thoughts are with the Governments and the
people of the Netherlands and Malaysia.

There is mounting evidence that the crash was
caused by a missile strike and that the aeroplane was
brought down over territory not controlled by the
Ukrainian authorities. There is increasing credible
information that that was conducted by separatist
militia groups, acting with the assistance of others. We
owe it to the victims of this tragedy and their families
to unequivocally establish the facts behind the incident
and to find out exactly what happened and who is
responsible. If, as appears increasingly likely, Flight
MH-17 was brought down by a missile, then that is,
as Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said,
"an unspeakable crime", and the perpetrators must be
brought swiftly to justice.

There must be a full, thorough and impartial
international investigation. We thank Under-Secretary-
General Feltman for his message that the United Nations
is fully prepared to cooperate with any investigation
and that the International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO) has offered its investigative capacity. We also
welcome Mr. Feltman's information that ICAO and
the Government of Ukraine are communicating on the
issue of an investigation.

There must be immediate preservation of the crash
site, and unfettered access for independent investigators.
Safe access must also be provided to allow fro the
recovery of the bodies of those who lost their lives in
the tragedy. Undertakings brokered by the trilateral
contact group with armed separatists who control the
territory in which the crash occurred to allow access
must be upheld. Our Prime Minister has made it clear
that Russia's full cooperation with all investigations is
expected.

The Council has just issued a press statement
calling for investigation, accountability and immediate
access to the crash site. That is welcome, but Australia
believes, given the gravity of the incident, that it is not a
sufficient indication of the Council's resolve. Australia
believes the Council should adopt a draft resolution
that emphasizes the need for access to be granted to
the crash site and for a full, thorough, independent and
international investigation to be carried out.

This is the nineteenth time that the Council has
met to discuss the situation in Ukraine since the
crisis began. Time and time again, the overwhelming
majority of the Security Council has called for a end to
the violence and destablization. Council members have
consistently called for a de-escalation of tensions, for
separatists to lay down their weapons and for genuine
dialogue to commence. It is time for the equivocation
and dissembling and false narratives of some to stop.

In the three weeks since the Council last discussed
the situation in Ukraine (see S/PV.7205), the security
situation in the east has become increasingly dire.
Separatists have ignored repeated calls to disarm and
have continued their attacks on Ukrainian military
forces, facilities and border posts. Two Ukrainian
military cargo planes were downed in eastern Ukraine
in the past week alone. The Ukrainian armed forces
have responded firmly to those attacks. They has every
right to restore law and order, and they have underlined
their commitment to do so in proportionate manner.

Russia has a crucial role to play in de-escalating
this persistently dangerous crisis. It must end its
provocations and any support for separatist forces. It
must control its border with Ukraine and prevent the
flow of weapons, equipment and fighters from Russia
into Ukraine. Russia must withdraw the large number
of troops it has again amassed on the Ukrainian border.
It must actively work to de-escalate tensions and use
its considerable influence with separatist groups in
Ukraine to that end.

Further political efforts are essential. The four-
party talks in Berlin in the past two weeks showed
some promise. The parties agreed on the need for a
sustainable ceasefire, the resumption of the contact
group, control of border crossing points monitored
by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) and an extension of the work of the
OSCE observer mission to include border monitoring
activities. But we have yet to see results; those efforts
must be redoubled.

We thought that the situation in Ukraine had
already caused too much tragedy. The horrific loss of
Flight MH-17 has added immeasurably to that toll. It is
time for the international community to stand as one to
ensure that those responsible for that tragic crime are
held to account and to make every effort to bring to an
end the violence and destabilization in Ukraine.
