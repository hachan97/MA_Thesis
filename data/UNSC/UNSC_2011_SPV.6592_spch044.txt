The President: We have covered a lot of ground in a
few hours. This has been a very useful dialogue. I know I
speak for the Council in thanking all the Force
Commanders for making it possible by making themselves
available. I think this should become a tradition and that we
should have such an exchange at least once a year.

I thank the Force Commanders for being with us
today.

The meeting rose at 2.05 p.m.
