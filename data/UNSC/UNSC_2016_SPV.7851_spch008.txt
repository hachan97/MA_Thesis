Mr. Bermudez (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish):
Uruguay voted in favour of resolution 2333 (2016),
extending the mandate of the United Nations Mission
in Liberia (UNMIL), as we feel it fitting and sensible
to proceed to a reduction of the military and police
component, striking a balance between the situation on
the ground and the request of the country concerned,
Liberia. Besides the reduction of military and police
forces, we have retained a component that will monitor
human rights in the country, which we welcome.

Nonetheless, Uruguay again notes the lack of
commitment and constructive spirit in the evolution of
negotiations on the text. During the briefing and the
consultations that took place on 12 December, major
differences emerged in the positions of members with
respect to the future of the United Nations presence
in Liberia after December. In that respect, Uruguay
believes that the best way to overcome differences
is through negotiations and constructive dialogue
in the search for shared positions acceptable to all
Council members.

As we stated when we renewed the mandate for
the United Nations Mission in South Sudan a few days
ago (see S/PV.7840), the Security Council must show
that it is able to adopt resolutions that achieve the
broadest possible support among its members. The role
of penholder is crucial in such negotiating situations,
and it is desirable that penholders demonstrate more
flexibility and be more receptive to proposals from
other Council members.

The international community is addressing a large
number of crises, and the Council has already revealed
differences and weaknesses in its actions in many. As
there are shared positions on the fundamental approach
to addressing the crisis in Liberia, we believe it is
unnecessary to add such divisions to the matter at hand.
We trust that procedures will improve in 2017.
