Mr. Gatilov (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian): The Russian delegation would like to
convey its deep and sincere condolences to the leadership
of the People's Republic of China and to the entire
Chinese people in connection with the death of the
outstanding State and political leader Mr. Deng Xiaoping,
whose name is linked with broad reforms in the life of
Chinese society and with China's positive contribution to
world affairs. Deep condolences have already been
expressed in this regard by the President of the Russian
Federation, Mr. Boris Yeltsin, and by other Russian
leaders.

Russia places high value on the role of Deng
Xiaoping in the normalization of Soviet-Chinese relations
and in the development of Russian-Chinese links, which
have reached a level of constructive partnership for
strategic cooperation into the twenty-first century, in the
interests of the Russian and Chinese peoples, and of the
entire international community.

 

We convey our sincerest condolences to the delegation
of China.
