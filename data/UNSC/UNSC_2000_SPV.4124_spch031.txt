The President: I thank the representative of
Afghanistan for his kind words addressed to me.

In accordance with the understanding reached in the
Council's prior consultations, and in the absence of
objection, I shall take it that the Security Council agrees to
extend an invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Ms. Angela King, Assistant Secretary-General
and Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of
Women.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
I invite Ms. King to take a seat at the Council table.

I now give the floor to Ms. King to respond to the
comments and questions that were issued by members of
the Council.
