Mr. Cheng Lie (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
welcomes the Council's unanimous adoption today of
resolution 2373 (2017), which reflects its important
support for the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL). China voted in favour of the
resolution, and we would like to thank France for its
work as penholder in the discussions and consultations
on the draft text. We recognize the mission's effective
fulfilment of its mandate, under the leadership ofMajor
General Beary, which has made a valuable contribution
to the overall maintenance of calm in the mission's
area of operations and to stability in the region. We
commend the Lebanese Government's cooperation
with UNIFIL and the dedication and sacrifices on the
part of all of the mission's peacekeepers and troop-
contributing countries.

Challenges still remain for the mission in the
form of the continuing crisis in Syria and the serious
terrorist situation inside Syria. The Council's extension
of UNIFIL's mandate for another 12 months should
help to maintain stability in the South of the country,
reduce the risk of incidents and escalation and facilitate
the further implementation of resolution 1701 (2006).
The Security Council and the international community
in general should continue to give UNIFIL political
support in order to ensure that it has the capacity
and resources to fulfil its mandate. We hope that all
the relevant parties will work diligently to implement
resolution 1701 (2006), exercise restraint, continue to
honour the agreement on the cessation of hostilities
and work together on further efforts to achieve a
permanent ceasefire arrangement. The Council and the
international community should continue to provide
assistance in that regard.
