Mr. Djani (Indonesia): Indonesia welcomes the
unanimous adoption of resolution to 2502 (2019).
We thank the penholder for its efforts in finding
compromise among diverging positions.

Indonesia voted in favour of the resolution for
several reasons, one of which is a response to the
call from the Democratic Republic of the Congo
to strengthen the capacities of the United Nations
Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) and extend its
mandate. We also recognize MONUSCO's invaluable
role in protecting civilians and maintaining peace and
stability in the country.

At the high-level event on improving peacekeeping
performance earlier this month, Ambassador Kelly
Craft stated that peacekeeping performance is about
accountability. While we subscribe to that statement,
we also emphasize that such accountability must
be balanced. MONUSCO is first and foremost a
peacekeeping mission that must adhere to a certain
standard of professionalism. At the same time, it is
important to recognize that performance standards
must apply to all components ofthe Mission, uniformed
and civilian. To attain that standard, peacekeeping
mandates must also be matched with the necessary
resources. Peacekeepers and the people they serve will
always be at risk and in harm's way if peacekeepers
have to do more with less. It is therefore vital to have
meaningful and regular consultations with troop-
and police-contributing countries throughout all
mission stages.

We welcome the improved balance in the section of
the resolution on performance. Indonesia reiterates its
commitment to working with Member States to improve
peacekeeping performance and create an accountable
peacekeeping mission. I salute the peacekeepers for
risking their lives and leaving their families behind to
pursue peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
and in the world. Their safety and security will be at the
top of Indonesia's priority.
