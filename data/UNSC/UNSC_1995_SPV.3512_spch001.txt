The President (interpretation from Chinese): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and
The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in which they
request to be invited to participate in the discussion of the
item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the discussion
without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Sacirbey

Mr. Maleski (The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) took places at the Council table.
