Mr. Hickey (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom was pleased to vote in favour of resolution
2469 (2019) resolution today. We believe the resolution
sends a strong signal of our support for the valuable
work of the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General,
ex-President Horst Kohler, in his efforts to find a
mutually acceptable political solution that will provide
for the self-determination of the people of Western
Sahara. We encourage the parties and the neighbouring
States to continue their constructive engagement with
the Personal Envoy and with one another, in line with
the spirit of the resolution.

We call on all concerned to refrain from any
activity that could undermine negotiations or escalate
tensions on the ground. At the second round table
meeting, the participants themselves recognized
the importance of working to build additional trust
away from the negotiation table. We encourage them
to continue to do so to support progress towards an
enduring political solution.

The text of the resolution also reflects the strong
support of the Council for the continuing work of
the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in
Western Sahara and for the Special Representative of
the Secretary-General, Mr. Colin Stewart, in carrying
out his duties. We regret that we were unable to speak
with one voice on the text before us today. However, we
remain convinced of the Council's unanimous support
for ex-President Kohler's efforts. Our support and the
support of the region and the international community
will be essential for a successful outcome to the process.
