The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document 8/2006/775, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Denmark, France, Ghana,
Greece, Slovakia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland and the United States of America.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall now give the floor to the representative of
Qatar, who wishes to make a statement before the
voting.
