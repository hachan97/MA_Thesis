Ms. Sanders (United States of America): My
delegation wishes to express its appreciation for
Ambassador Verbeke's diligent work as Chairman of
the Security Council Committee established pursuant
to resolution 1737 (2006) and for his report to the
Council today. Ambassador Verbeke's leadership has
been essential in the Committee's work thus far to
establish its guidelines and move towards a substantive
discussion of Member States' responsibilities and
compliance with resolution 1737 (2006). Iran's
compliance with all of the resolutions of this Council
and of the Board of Governors of the International
Atomic Energy Agency is essential, and we urge all
Member States to stress the importance of this step in
their regular discussions and consultations with Iran.

We are pleased to note that many States have
taken seriously their obligations under resolution 1737
(2006) and have submitted reports on their
implementation of the sanctions measures contained
therein. My delegation found many of those reports
extensive in their scope and discussion.

On the other hand, we also found some reports to
be much less detailed in their treatment of the steps
taken by Member States to enforce or enact laws or
regulations to implement the resolution. We believe
that it is essential for Member States to provide
comprehensive descriptions of their actions to meet the
obligations of resolution 1737 (2006) and, more
generally, any Security Council resolution involving a
reporting requirement.

Moreover, we are concerned that approximately
70 per cent of Member States have yet to submit their
reports to the Sanctions Committee. We urge those
States that have not yet done so to fulfil that
requirement without delay. Finally, my delegation
notes that progress on defining the Committee's
guidelines has been satisfactory to date, and we look
forward to the Committee's resuming its substantive
discussions in the near term.
