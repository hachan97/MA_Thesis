The President: I would simply request Dr. Piot -
bearing in mind that we have never discussed this issue
before, but that it may, as many speakers have suggested,
remain open for continuation - perhaps to circulate to the
members of the Security Council responses in writing to
some of the specifics, such as that one, in order to further
illuminate us, as I am sure he already does with the
Economic and Social Council.
