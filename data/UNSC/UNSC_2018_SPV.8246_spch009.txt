Mr. Almunayekh (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic):
Kuwait voted in favour of resolution 2414 (2018),
renewing the mandate of the United Nations Mission
for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO),
as we believe that the presence of the Mission in such
circumstances is of the utmost importance, given that
it contributes to enhancing and consolidating stability
in the region.

Meanwhile, the resolution on which we have just
voted is a reflection of the desire of the Secretary-
General to relaunch the political negotiations between
the parties. In that regard, we appreciate the efforts
of the Head and members of MINURSO to carry out
the mandate, as provided for in the relevant Council
resolutions, including the one we have just adopted.

Kuwait reiterates its full support for the efforts of
Mr. Kohler, Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General
for Western Sahara, to relaunch the negotiations
under the auspices of the United Nations, without any
preconditions and in good faith, so as to reach a just
and mutually acceptable political solution that ensures
that the people of Western Sahara can exercise their
right of self-determination within arrangements that
are in accordance with the purposes and principles
of the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant
Council resolutions.
