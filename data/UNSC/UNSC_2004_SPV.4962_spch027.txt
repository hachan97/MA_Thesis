Mr. Tiirk: I would like to express appreciation
for the comments made by the members of the Security
Council who have expressed support for the work of
the United Nations Observer Mission in Bougainville. I
would like to assure members that the content of this
discussion will be conveyed to the Mission in all of its
aspects, including those that relate to some of the
recent difficulties. We will be continuing our efforts to
complete the work of the Mission successfully.

I would also like to mention that today, when we
find ourselves in a situation of successful continuation
and when we are close to the completion of our work,
we have to be aware that this work relates to a past
conflict of considerable proportions: almost 15,000
people were reported to have been killed during the
armed conflict in Bougainville years ago. That is the
magnitude that we have to keep in mind. Every effort
must be made to ensure the successful completion of
the current stage of the peace process.

In that context, a particularly important aspect
will be placing increasing emphasis on long-term
assistance. You yourself, Mr. President, referred to that
aspect, and so did many other members of the Security
Council. We have taken careful note of that and will
give further thought to it. We will continue to
appreciate the work being done and assistance being
offered by the countries in the region. There may be
new ideas that we will be able to discuss with the
Security Council in the coming period.

Obviously, the work is not yet done. We are very
close to the successful completion of this process, but
we have not completed it as yet, and the Security
Council would be well advised to pay further attention
in the future to the peace process in Bougainville.
