The President (spoke in French): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as representative of
France, before giving the floor to the last speaker,
Ambassador Cunningham of the United States.

Yesterday, together with the entire population of
New York and all the American people, we experienced
a day of horror, a day of terror that shall forever leave
its mark upon our lives. The scourge of terrorism from
which most of our countries have suffered undoubtedly
destroyed, on 11 September, thousands of innocent
American lives.

Like all of the European Union, whose ministers
have just forcefully expressed themselves, France
stands side by side with the United States in this time
of trial. We convey to all of the victims of the families
and to the American people our condolences and
express our fraternal solidarity.

In the face of what constitutes an attack upon all
of humanity, as the Secretary-General has just said, in
the face of an attack against the values and principles
that unite us and which our Charter embodies, it is a
time for unity and resolve.

All together, we must say that nothing anywhere
can ever justify resort to terrorism. All together, we
must take the view that the monstrous acts committed
yesterday are a challenge to the international
community as a whole. Yes, we stand with the United
States in deciding upon any appropriate action to
combat those who resort to terrorism, those who aid
them and those who protect them. A global strategy is
needed. The Security Council is the principal organ
entrusted with international peace and security. It
should work on this in a spirit of urgency.
