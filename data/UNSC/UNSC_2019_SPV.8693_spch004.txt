The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as the representative of the United States.

As co-penholder, the United States welcomes the
today's unanimous decision to renew the mandate of
the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force
(UNDOF). We would like to thank the members of the
Security Council for their constructive work in drafting
the mandate.

The United States is pleased that the Council voiced
its unified support for the resumption of inspections in
the Bravo side area of limitation. The United States

believes UNDOF continues to have a vital role to play
in preserving stability between Israel and Syria. We
respect and recognize the mission's impartiality.

The Council should be under no illusion,
however, that there is any equivalence between the
noted Violations on the Israeli and Syrian sides. On
19 November four rockets were fired towards Israel
from inside Syria. They were all intercepted by Israel's
Iron Dome system, likely saving the lives of civilian
men, women and children. While UNDOF has flagged
Iron Dome emplacements as technical violations of the
Disengagement of Forces Agreement, no comparison
should be drawn between those defensive systems and
Syrian violations.

Much has been said about President Trump's
announcement earlier this year recognizing Israel's
sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Today's renewal
demonstrates that the United States is committed
to the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement
and that that announcement in no way undermines
UNDOF's mandate.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

There are no more names inscribed on the list
of speakers.

The meeting rose at 10.50 a.m.
