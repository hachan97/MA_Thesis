Mr. Ladeb (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, we would like to welcome the Secretary-General, who is present with us. We also thank Under-Secretary- General Ms. Rosemary DiCarlo for her briefing. As the Secretary-General said in his remarks today, we are following with deep concern the escalation in north-western Syria and the expansion of military operations there. We call on all parties to exercise restraint and to continue their communication efforts to achieve a ceasefire. The continued and expanded escalation is a genuine threat to civilians. It exacerbates the humanitarian situation and causes increased suffering. We reaffirm the need to respect international humanitarian law and to spare civilians and civilian infrastructure. We urge all sides to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian and medical assistance to all those in need. We would also like to express our condolences to the families of those from Turkey and Syria who have died. We reaffirm our position that there is no military solution to the crisis in Syria. The only sustained solution is a political settlhement in accordance with resolution 2254 (2015) through the resumption of a political process. Today we would like to emphasize that the military option will further complicate the situation and cause more suffering to the population. We therefore support the current contacts between the relevant parties, the appeal of the Secretary-General and the efforts of the United Nations. We hope that all such efforts will lead to an immediate ceasefire, which is the most urgent priority at the moment.
