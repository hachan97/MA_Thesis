The President (spoke in Spanish): Before giving
the floor to the representative of the Republic of Korea,
I wish to remind delegations to limit their oral
statements to five minutes; they may, of course,
distribute their complete written statements. The
average length of statements is double what was
recommended. That means that with the large number
of speakers still remaining, we could be here until
8 pm. or later. I therefore call again on representatives
to exercise their ability to summarize.

I give the floor to the representative of the
Republic of Korea.
