The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as representative of the United Kingdom.

The British Government's determination to take all
possible steps to eradicate international terrorism in all its
forms and manifestations is well known. We were
shocked by and have strongly condemned the
assassination attempt on President Mubarak of Egypt in
Addis Ababa on 26 June 1995.

We applaud the Ethiopian Government for its
effective investigation into that attack. We find
convincing the evidence they have produced about the
perpetrators of the crime.

We regret the failure of the Government of the
Sudan to comply with the requests by the Organization of
African Unity in the statements issued by the Central
Mechanism in September and December 1995.

We welcome the initiative by the Non-Aligned
members of the Council in bringing forward the draft
resolution that has just been adopted. We very much hope
that the Government of the Sudan will cooperate fully in
the implementation of the resolution, in particular by
extraditing forthwith the three suspects for prosecution. In
