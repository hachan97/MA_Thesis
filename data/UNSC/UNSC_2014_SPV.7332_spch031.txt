Mr. Milanovic' (Serbia): I am regretfully compelled
to take the floor once again. This body is too precious
to be abused for the conduct of a domestic electoral
campaign. The conduct of Croatia related to some recent
events cannot be said to have been fully conducive to
building on what we have achieved thus far - not
the future that we all aspire to. One needs to look no
further than to the treatment of the members of the
Serbian minority over the past 20 years in Croatia, and
still today, and the character of the frequent incidents
directed against them.

Serbia has invested significant efforts in stabilizing
its delicate relations with Croatia and in resolving
outstanding questions to mutual satisfaction and
benefit. Numerous problems in the area of the rule
of law, human rights and freedoms and the return
of displaced Serbs and restitution of their property
existed as Croatia marched towards European Union
accession. They continue to exist today, well after its
accession. Those problems could have been raised and
solutions insisted upon, yet my country did not do so as
it considered that open questions could be resolved in
a bilateral context and that European integration by all
of the countries of the region was much more important
to regional stability and would have served to solve all
of the questions.
