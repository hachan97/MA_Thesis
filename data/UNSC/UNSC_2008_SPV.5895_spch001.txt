The President: At the outset of the meeting, I
should like, on behalf of the entire Security Council, to
extend our heartfelt sympathy to the Government and
people of China in connection with the earthquake that
occurred in Sichuan and resulted in immense
devastation and heavy loss of life. I request the
representative of China to convey to his Government
and the families of the victims our sincere condolences
for the tragedy that they have suffered. In a similar
vein, I would like, on behalf of the Security Council, to
extend our sympathy to Myanmar and its people
following the devastation caused by cyclone Nargis.

May I invite all present in the Chamber to stand
and observe a minute of silence in tribute to the
memory of the Victims of those disasters.

The members ofthe Council observed a minute of
silence.
