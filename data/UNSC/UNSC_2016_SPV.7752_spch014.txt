Mr. Taula (New Zealand): New Zealand voted
in favour of resolution 2303 (2016). The situation in
Burundi and the risk of further escalation continues to
be of major concern to New Zealand. The resolution
meets our expectations for a credible and appropriate
response. We would stress that the resolution is not the
end of the process but a small milestone in efforts to
restore peace and stability. Achieving this must take
place in the context of efforts to achieve a political
solution, with a significant role for the region and
supporting a genuine incredible inter-Burundian
dialogue.
