The President: I thank the representative of Nigeria
for the kind words he addressed to me.

Before I call on the next speaker inscribed on my
list, I should like to make a very brief announcement.

Members of the Council will recall that the
Secretary-General made his best efforts to sit through the
morning session of this meeting. He came again to sit in
on part of this afternoon's session, but unfortunately he
has left, leaving the message that he had another pressing
engagement this afternoon. I would like to take this
opportunity to express gratitude on my part, as President
of the Security Council, for his strong interest in
attending this meeting.

The Secretary-General asked me to say that the
Deputy Secretary-General, Mrs. Frechette, is going to
replace him in his chair and I am given to understand that
this is the first time in history that someone other than the
Secretary-General has sat there. I would like to welcome
the Deputy Secretary-General.

The next speaker is the representative of South
Africa. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and
to make his statement.
