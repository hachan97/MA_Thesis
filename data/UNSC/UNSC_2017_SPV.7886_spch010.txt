Mr. Rycroft (United Kingdom): Like others, I
should like to express my deepest personal condolences
to the delegation of the Russian Federation and to the
family and friends of Vitaly Churkin. Vitaly was an
exceptional diplomat and a truly remarkable man. We
disagreed on many issues, but I always found him to be
an honest and decent colleague, no matter the issues, no
matter the positions. It has not really sunk in yet that he
has died. I will remember him every day. My thoughts
go out to Irina, to their children, to their family, to Petr,
to all the members of the Russian delegation, to all
Russian diplomats everywhere.

I will always remember the lessons that I learned
from Vitaly. He was a diplomatic giant, a maestro of the
Security Council. May he rest in peace.
