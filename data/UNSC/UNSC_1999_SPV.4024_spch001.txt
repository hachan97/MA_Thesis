The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.

By a note dated 16 July 1999, document S/1999/793,
the Secretary-General circulated the application of the
Kingdom of Tonga for admission to membership in the
United Nations, contained in a letter dated 8 July 1999
from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence of the
Kingdom of Tonga addressed to the Secretary-General.

Under the provisions of rule 59 of the provisional
rules of procedure of the Security Council, unless the
Council decides otherwise, an application for membership
shall be referred by the President of the Council to the
Committee on the Admission of New Members.
Accordingly, unless I hear a proposal to the contrary, I
shall refer the application of the Kingdom of Tonga to the
Committee on the Admission of New Members for
examination and report.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
The Committee on the Admission of New Members
will meet on Monday, 26 July 1999, at 3.30 p.m., in

Conference Room 7.

The Security Council has completed its business for
this meeting.

Members of the Council are invited to join me in the
Security Council Consultation Room for the scheduled

consultations.

The meeting rose at 10.50 am.
