The President: I thank Ambassador Otunnu for
his excellent briefing. I should also like to thank him,
on behalf of the Council, for undertaking the visit to
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as mandated by
the Council. We believe that his five-point programme
of action, which he says has the acceptance of all
political sides, will require the attention of the Council
as we engage in the preparation of the draft resolution
with regard to the extension of MONUC's mandate. In
addition, various other points, particularly the
subregional angle that Mr. Otunnu brought in, will
require our attention on related agenda items of the
Council. I thank him also for his gracious reference to
me.

I now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation of the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, Mr. Leonard Okitundu.
