The President: I wish to thank Mr. Vieira de
Mello for his comprehensive briefing and his kind
words addressed to me, which I appreciate.

As there is no list of speakers for this meeting, I
invite Council members who wish to take the floor to
so indicate to the secretariat as from now.

I now give the floor to Mr. Mari Alkatiri, Chief
Minister of the Second Transitional Government of
East Timor.
