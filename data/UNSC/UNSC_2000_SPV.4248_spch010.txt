Mr. Ouane (Mali) (spoke in French): My
delegation associates itself fully with the statement
made by Namibia on behalf of the non-aligned caucus.
I would nevertheless like to make three brief
observations.

First of all, I would like to say that Mali will vote
in favour of the draft resolution under consideration
because we believe that the Security Council must take
a decision in the face of the tragic and violent events
that have been taking place in the Palestinian territories
since 28 September, which have taken many victims,
mainly Palestinians. We must act to put an end to the
violence. We must bring an end to the excessive use of
force. We must ensure the protection of Palestinian
civilians. It is for these reasons that we fully support
the creation of an observer force. We believe that the
deployment of such a force will contribute to
stabilizing the situation while being of great benefit to
the Palestinian and Israeli civilian populations.

Secondly, I would like to underscore the fact that
Mali continues to fully support the peace process as a
whole. In that connection, we are pleased with the
resumption of the bilateral dialogue between the
parties. We hope that the ongoing diplomatic efforts
will bring about concrete results consistent with the
Sharm el-Sheikh and earlier agreements.

Thirdly, and lastly, I would like to say that my
delegation regrets that, despite the great degree of
flexibility demonstrated by the sponsors, no consensus
was achieved on the draft resolution on which we are
about to vote. We consider that the text of the draft
resolution is balanced and that it seeks to find common
ground between the parties by giving the Secretary-
General a leading role.

My delegation will vote in favour of the draft
resolution before us.
