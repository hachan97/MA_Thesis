The President (interpretation from French): Before
calling on the next speaker, I should like to inform the
Council that I have just received letters from the
representatives of Argentina, Costa Rica, the United Arab
Emirates and Mauritania, in which they request to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice,
I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional
rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Di Tella
(Argentina), Mr. Berrocal Soto (Costa Rica), Mr.
Ould Cheikh Ahmed (Mauritania) and Mr. Al-
Noaimi (United Arab Emirates) took the seats
reserved for them at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The President (interpretation from French): The
next speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of
Senegal, His Excellency Mr. Moustapha Niasse. I
welcome him, and I invite him to take a seat at the
Council table and to make his statement.
