Mr. Mohamed (Maldives): The Maldives
strongly supports the right of the Palestinian people to
freely determine their own political and economic
system, including the right to resist forcible
deprivation of their right to self-determination and
their right to live in peace and freedom in their own
State. We also support the inalienable right of the
people of Israel to live in peace and security. Perhaps
the greatest tragedy of the Gaza conflict is that,
although fought to assert these rights, it in fact pushes
them further away.

The Maldives believes that the report of the Fact-
Finding Mission led by Justice Goldstone is detailed
and thorough. We sincerely regret Israel's decision not
to cooperate with the Mission.

That said, a few things are clear: The blockade
amounts to collective punishment intentionally
inflicted by the Government of Israel on the people of
the Gaza Strip. As such, the blockade violates
international law and should be immediately lifted. The
launching of rockets by Palestinian armed groups into
Israeli civilian areas constitutes a grave violation of
humanitarian and human rights law. The Israeli
military incursion into Gaza in response to those rocket
attacks was massively disproportionate, and the
destruction of houses, factories, schools and hospitals
and the large number of civilian casualties
demonstrate, at best, a blatant disregard for the
fundamental principle of distinction.

The Maldives believes that the clear and manifest
violations of human rights and humanitarian law that
have occurred in Gaza warrant careful and verifiable
scrutiny. Accountability must be established and justice
pursued. The Maldives therefore supports the
recommendation, contained in the report, that all
alleged violations by both sides in the conflict be
independently investigated and that those
investigations together with any subsequent
prosecutions be monitored by the Security Council.
