Mr. Skoog (Sweden): It is not every day that the
Council takes decisions that have a direct impact on
the people affected by conflict, but today is such a day.
On behalf of the co-penholders, Egypt and Japan, I
strongly welcome the adoption today of resolution 2393
(2017), which maintains a vital humanitarian lifeline
for 3 million people in Syria. There is no alternative
humanitarian route to access parts of northern and
southern Syria. Renewing the provisions of resolution
2165 (2014) for a full 12 months will without doubt save
lives and alleviate suffering.

Over the past weeks, we have worked very hard
with Council members to reach this agreement. The
resolution requests the Secretary-General to conduct an
independent review of these humanitarian operations.
That will allow the Council to have an even more
solid basis for future decisions. On behalf of the
co-penholders, I would like to thank the representatives
of all delegations for their constructive engagement
during the negotiations on the resolution. I would
also like to thank the staff of the United Nations
humanitarian agencies, their implementing partners
and Turkey and Jordan for enabling these humanitarian
deliveries to take place, as well as Under-Secretary-
General Lowcock and his team here in New York.
Since the humanitarian situation remains devastating
and the needs enormous, agreement on the resolution
was imperative. Discussions on Syria in the Council are
often difficult. We therefore see today's adoption as a
special accomplishment.

The world has been failing the Syrian people for
more than six years, and the humanitarian situation
will continue to deteriorate in the absence ofa political
solution to the crisis. The Council must spare no effort
to end the conflict in Syria. We hope that today's
agreement can help build momentum for constructive
and broader Council engagement on Syria.
