The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Yugoslavia, in which he requests
to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item
on the Council's agenda. In accordance with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Sahovic
(Yugoslavia) took a seat at the Council table.

The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
photocopies of the report of the Security Council
Mission to Kosovo and Belgrade, Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, from 13 to 17 December 2002. This report
will be issued as Security Council document
S/2002/1376.

The Security Council will now hear a briefing by
His Excellency Mr. Ole Peter Kolby.

I give the floor to Mr. Kolby, Head of the
Security Council Mission to Kosovo and Belgrade,
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
