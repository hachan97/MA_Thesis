Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
Chinese delegation welcomes resolution 2003 (2011),
just adopted by the Council. China voted in favour of
the resolution.

China has consistently supported the peace
process in Darfur, the Sudan, and we hope for an early
attainment of peace, prosperity and development in
Darfur. China maintains that the issue of Darfur should
be addressed through the dual-track strategy, with
equal emphasis on peacekeeping deployment and the
political process. We support the renewal of the
mandate of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid
Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) in order to continue to
implement the Security Council mandate.

The African Union (AU) is an important partner
of the United Nations in addressing questions related to
the Sudan. The AU's position on the Darfur political
process merits close attention. China supports
UNAMID playing an important role in supporting the
political process in Darfur.
