The President: I thank the representative of
Senegal for the kind words he addressed to me and to
my delegation regarding our presidency of the Council,
as well as for his acknowledgement of our initiative to
discuss the role of civil society in post-conflict peace-
building in the Council.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Nepal.
