Mr. Martins (Angola): Like the other members
of the Security Council, Angola voted in favour of
resolution 2336 (2016), and we would like to thank the
delegation of the Russian Federation for convening
today's meeting for the unanimous adoption of a
resolution aimed at establishing a ceasefire agreement
in the Syrian Arab Republic. We should consider it a real
contribution to creating a path to peace and stability in
a country that has occupied such a central place on our
agenda during the past year, the year that is about to
end. We would like to commend the Russian Federation
for the central role that it has played in achieving that
goal, and Turkey for the joint agreement that has been
signed. We look forward to the peace talks to be held
in Astana.

Obviously, there are no perfect agreements. What is
essential is that the efforts should focus on the common
goal of achieving peace and enabling the citizens
of Syria to reconcile and rebuild their nation within
parameters that they establish themselves, with the
support of the international community. The Security
Council resolution remains a relevant and important
instrument for resolving the conflict. We are aware
that its unanimous adoption has reinforced the chances
for peace, and that unanimity represents a very good
way of ending the year with a decision that we have
repeatedly insisted on - that the solution must be a
political one. This decision will enable that.

As Angola's membership of the Security Council
ends - and coincides with the very last day of
2016 - I would like to take this opportunity to wish all
our colleagues and the members of the Council a very
peaceful and prosperous new year.
