The President: Ithank Mr. Nebenzia and Mrs. Haley
for the points they have made. In our understanding,
in accordance with rule 32 of the provisional rules of
procedure, which states that principal motions and
draft resolutions shall have precedence in the order
of their submission, the draft resolution submitted by
Russia (S/2017/933) should therefore be put to the vote
first. The representative of the Russian Federation has
requested a procedural vote on the question of whether
the Russian draft resolution should be put to the vote
second and the United States draft resolution first
(S/2017/962).

I shall put the procedural motion to the vote now.
A vote was taken by show ofhands.

In favour:
Bolivia (Plurinational State of), China, Russian
Federation

Against:
France, Italy, Japan, Sweden, Ukraine, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America

Abstaining:
Egypt, Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Senegal, Uruguay

The President: The proposal received 3 votes
in favour, 7 votes against and 5 abstentions. The
procedural motion was not adopted, having failed to
obtain the required number of votes.
