Mr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian): The Russian delegation has already had
the opportunity, in the Security Council and at the
meeting of the General Assembly, to express its views on
the situation resulting from the decision of the
Government of Israel to build a new housing complex in
East Jerusalem. We condemn the fact that Israel has
begun construction on such a settlement. This runs
counter to both the letter and the spirit of the Middle East
peace process and to the principles that were set out as its
basis in Madrid.

Unfortunately, because of Israel's acts of
provocation in the occupied territories, the situation
continues to deteriorate and is becoming increasingly
confrontational. All this, in conjunction with the most
recent outbreak of violence, has complicated the
negotiation process.

As a co-sponsor of the peace process, Russia
urgently calls on the Government of Israel to rescind its
decision to build a new settlement in East Jerusalem. It is
important also that both parties make every effort to avoid
any further instances of confrontation in Palestinian-Israeli

 

relations and to break the deadlock at which the peace
process finds itself.

For that reason, the Russian delegation voted in favour
of the draft resolution before us, which ought to have been
adopted as an appropriate reaction to the alarming events in
East Jerusalem. We were also prepared to support a similar
draft presidential statement, had we managed to reach
consensus on it today.

We strongly condemn the terrorist acts that occurred
today in Tel Aviv. These criminal acts cannot be in any
way warranted, and we express our deepest sympathy to the
families of those who were wounded or killed.
