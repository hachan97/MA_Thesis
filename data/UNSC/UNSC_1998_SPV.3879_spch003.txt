The President: I thank the representative of
Tajikistan for the kind words he addressed to me.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the voting.
