Mr. Laro (Nigeria): We would like to begin by
congratulating the parties - the Islamic Republic of
Iran, China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation,
the United Kingdom, the United States and the
European Union - on the historic agreement reached
last week on the Iranian nuclear programme. The
agreement is a victory for diplomacy. It proves that, no
matter how difficult a subject is, with commitment and
determination, negotiations can produce results.

Nigeria voted in favour of resolution 2231 (2015)
because we are convinced that it will aid in the
process of implementing the agreement. The Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action clearly spells out the
obligations of the parties. We urge them to implement
the plan transparently and in good faith.

We takes this opportunity once more to reaffirm
our support for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy,
in accordance with article IV of the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
