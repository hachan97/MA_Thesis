The President (spoke in Chinese): I will now make a
statement in my capacity as the representative of China.

The Chinese delegation thanks the Secretary-General
for his report on the situation in Tajikistan. Our thanks also
go to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General,
Mr. Petrov, for his briefing.

At the outset I would like to express my
congratulations for the success achieved in the peace
process in Tajikistan and by the United Nations
peacekeeping operation in that country. This success shows
that the practical implementation of the peace agreement
and the success of the United Nations peacekeeping
operation have depended on the political will of the Tajik
Government and other parties concerned. They have also
depended on the strong support of the international
community. We express our profound appreciation to the
United Nations, the Contact Group, the Russian Federation
and other parties concerned for their efforts.

As the mandate of the United Nations Mission of
Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) comes to an end, we
would like to pay special tribute to the successive Special
Representatives of the Secretary-General for their
contributions.

We salute UNMOT for the important role it has
played in promoting national reconciliation in Tajikistan,
especially those who gave their lives for the cause of
peace in Tajikistan.

We support the intention of the Secretary-General to
hold consultations with the Tajik Government with a view
to agreeing as soon as possible on the establishment of
the United Nations post-conflict peace-building office in
Tajikistan.

As a friendly neighbour of Tajikistan, China will
continue to contribute to the economic rehabilitation and
social development of Tajikistan.

In closing, the Chinese delegation supports the draft
presidential statement to be adopted by the Council.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Tajikistan.
