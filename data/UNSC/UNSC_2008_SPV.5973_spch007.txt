Mr. Terzi di Sant'Agata (Italy): I, too, should
like to thank Ambassador Grauls for his comprehensive
briefing and efficient leadership of the Security
Council Committee established pursuant to resolution
1737 (2006).

Consistent with the position of the European
Union, Italy remains committed to solving the Iranian
nuclear issue through a dual-track approach based on
political dialogue and full implementation of
resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007) and 1803 (2008).
In that regard, I wish to recall that, on 7 August, the
European Council adopted the Common Position
2008/652/CFSP, aimed at implementing resolution
1803 (2008). That Common Position contains, inter
alia, concrete measures to exercise vigilance, as
required by resolution 1803 (2008), on relevant
financial activities under the guidance of the Financial
Action Task Force expressly mentioned in resolution
1803 (2008).

More broadly, I wish to underline that combating
the financing of proliferation activities is a firm
priority for Italy and an integral part of the global
effort against the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction (WMD). Thus, the Italian authorities, and
the Bank of Italy in particular, have issued several
warnings and are reaching out to the banking system
on the need to combat the proliferation of WMDs and
the risk involved in maintaining business relations,
even unknowingly, with entities connected to
proliferation.

An outreach effort is under way to raise the
awareness of the private sector of measures adopted
pursuant to Council resolutions, and to follow that up
concretely, a seminar, organized by the Ministry of
Finance together with the United Nations Interregional
Crime and Justice Research Institute, will be held on
that issue in Rome on 25 September.
