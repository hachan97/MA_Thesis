The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank the
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ghana, current
Chairman of the Economic Community of West
African States for the heartfelt condolences he
extended to the United Nations and to the Security
Council on the demise of Special Representative of the
Secretary-General for Iraq, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello,
and members of his staff as a result of the atrocious act
of aggression against the United Nations headquarters
in Baghdad.

I now give the floor to Mr. Mohamed Ibn
Chambas, Executive Secretary of ECOWAS.
