The President (spoke in Spanish): As it is now
10 minutes past 1 p.m. and since there are still speakers
remaining on the list, the wise and experienced
individuals who assist the presidency have suggested
that, with the consent of the Council, this meeting be
suspended until 3 p.m. If there are no objections, I
shall suspend the meeting.

The meeting was suspended at 1.10pm.
