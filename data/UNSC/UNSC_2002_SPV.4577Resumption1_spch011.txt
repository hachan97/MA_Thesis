The President: I have one follow-up question on
economic development. Mr. Mar Dieye talked about
where the region sits in terms of the Human
Development Index. We all know that if a country or a
region really wants to develop quickly, then we need to
attract investment and to retain capital in-country. It
seems to me, given what Mr. Mar Dieye and, indeed,
what Sir Kieran said, that we are very far from that in
this region. What should the priorities be to enable us
to get to the place where economic development
becomes a reality?
