The President (interpretation from French): I thank
the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Georgia for his kind
words addressed to me.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
vote on the draft resolution before it, as orally amended, in
its provisional form. If I hear no objection I shall put the
draft resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council who
wish to make statements before the voting.
