Mr. Aboulatta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): My
delegation would like to begin by thanking the
Secretary-General and the Secretariat for preparing
this important report (S/2016/1136) on monitoring
the implementation of resolution 2231 (2015), on
Iran. I would also like to welcome my friend and
colleague Ambassador Sebastiano Cardi as facilitator
for the resolution's implementation and to wish him
every success.

Egypt would like to emphasize the importance of
Iran's continued compliance with its obligations under
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
and related Security Council resolutions. The Security
Council and the relevant international organizations
must continue to carry out their responsibilities
regarding verification of Iran's compliance with
its commitments in the area of nuclear and missile
activities, as well as other activities covered under the
Security Council resolutions, particularly resolution
2231 (2015), on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.

We would also like to stress how seriously we take
Iran's suspected continuing illegal arms trafficking in
the Middle East, its role in fuelling some ofthe conflicts
in the region and its sponsorship of terrorism, all of
them activities that destabilize the region. They are a
violation of United Nations principles, first and foremost
the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs
of States. They also run counter to the neighbourly
relations that we wish all countries in the region would
commit to so that we can achieve the stability we want,
paving the way for constructive dialogue.

In that context, we should once again reiterate
the resolutions of the League of Arab States on Iran's
conduct in the region, particularly the importance of
reaching a settlement on the three Emirati islands and
addressing Iran's interference in the internal affairs of
Arab States, as well as its conduct, which has a clearly
sectarian attitude that tends to exacerbate the tension,
division and violence that are already widespread in the
Middle East.
