Mr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon) (spoke in French): I would like to say how very pleased we are
to have Mr. James Morris, Executive Director of the
World Food Programme (WFP), here with us. He has
spoken to us about an extremely difficult and relevant
issue: the food crisis in Africa, which poses a threat to
international peace and security.

We have heard to some extent a repetition of what
we were told last December regarding the major
obstacles to the activities of the WFP: weather
conditions, health/sanitation conditions, HIV/AIDS and
those that could also be considered as man-made, such
as civil disorder, conflict and problems of governance.

The question I would like to ask Mr. Morris - in
response to your appeal, Mr. President, to get straight
to the heart of the matter - is the following. The
mandate of the WFP was expanded in 1999 to make the
Programme an instrument for development. In fact,
WFP was called on to use food assistance, essentially
and as a priority, to support economic and social
development actions. This was the primary objective.
The other objectives relate to so-called emergency
situations where there is a need to cope with the
immediate needs of refugees and of populations that
have fallen victim to humanitarian crises.

At present, the emergency functions and
objectives seem to be, in fact, highly pivotal to what
the WFP is doing. What about the essential function
aimed at preventing emergency situations, namely, the
use of food assistance to support development actions?
That is my question to the Executive Director; it refers
to WFP's new mandate. We pay tribute to WFP's work,
which is so beneficial in emergency situations,
including today in Iraq. But that does not prevent us
from going back to the crux of the mandate, which is to
support development action to prevent emergency
situations.
