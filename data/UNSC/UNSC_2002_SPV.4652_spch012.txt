Mr. Atieh (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): We congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption
of the presidency of the Security Council for this
month. We should also like to thank the Permanent
Representative of China and his team for their
excellent work last month. In addition, we welcome
Mr. James Morris, Executive Director of the World
Food Programme (WFP), and we thank him for his
comprehensive briefing on the WFP's implementation
of programmes to feed hungry people throughout the
world, particularly in Africa.

The 25-per-cent reduction in humanitarian
funding is a matter of great concern. The WFP requires
continuous funding so that it can fulfil its mandate and
implement its programmes. The encouragement of
investment - particularly in agriculture - could
provide at least a minimal degree of food security for
affected countries and peoples suffering from hunger
for various reasons. My delegation agrees with
Mr. Morris that we should invest in school feeding
programmes, because educating healthy children means
preparing a better generation for building a better
society - a generation with the necessary awareness to
achieve economic, social and political stability,
especially in countries that suffer from food problems
as a result of climate, occupation, scarcity of economic
resources and war, among other things.

I should like to ask Mr. Morris about WFP
policies with regard to school feeding in Africa so that
children are not forced to resort to illegal acts to make
a living. Are there programmes to raise the awareness
of children - particularly girls - in addition to
programmes to provide them with the necessary
nutrition?
