The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

In a letter dated 16 April 1999 addressed to the
Secretary-General, the President and Minister for External
Affairs of the Republic of Nauru submitted the application
of his country for membership in the United Nations.
That letter has been circulated in document 5/1999/478.

Under the provisions of rule 59 of the provisional
rules of procedure of the Security Council, unless the
Council decides otherwise, an application for membership
shall be referred by the President of the Council to the
Committee on the Admission of New Members.
Accordingly, unless I hear a proposal to the contrary, I
shall refer the application of the Republic of Nauru to the
Committee on the Admission of New Members for
examination and report.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The date for the meeting of the Committee on the
Admission of New Members will be fixed by the
President in consultations with the members of the

Council.

The meeting rose at 12.20 pm.
