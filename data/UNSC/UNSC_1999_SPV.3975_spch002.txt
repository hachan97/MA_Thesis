The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received letters from the representatives of
Eritrea and Ethiopia, in which they request to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's
agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose,
with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional
rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Menkerios
(Eritrea) and Mr. Mohammed (Ethiopia) took seats
at the Council table.

The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council
is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them document
S/ 1999/ 133, which contains the text of a draft resolution
prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations. I should like to draw the attention of the
members of the Council to the following other
documents: S/ 1999/97, S/ 1999/ 117 and S/ 1999/ 128, letters
dated 29 January, 5 and 8 February 1999, respectively,
from the Permanent Representative of Eritrea to the

Council; S/l999/104, S/1999/115, S/l999/ll9 and
S/1999/131, letters dated 2, 4, 5 and 9 February 1999,

of the Security Council; and S/ 1999/126, letter dated 8
February 1999, from the Permanent Representative of
Burkina Faso to the United Nations addressed to the

The first speaker on my list is the representative of
Ethiopia, to whom I give the floor.
