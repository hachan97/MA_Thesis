The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank
Mr. Prendergast, Under-Secretary-General for Political
Affairs, for his comprehensive briefing on Afghanistan.
I believe that Council members will agree with me that
the Afghan people have long suffered as victims of
war's destruction and that they deserve the
international community's utmost assistance in their
quest for stability and peace.

We also express the hope that the convening and
outcome of the loya jirga will open a new page in the
life of the Afghan people, a page of the reconstruction
and development of their country.

In accordance with the understanding reached in
the Council's prior consultations, I should now like to
invite Council members to informal consultations to
continue our discussion of this subject.
The meeting rose at 11.10 am.
