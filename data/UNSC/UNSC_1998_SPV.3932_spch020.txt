The President: I thank the representative of Japan
for his statement. I take the liberty to do so with special
emphasis, since it is my understanding that today is the
last day that Ambassador Owada will be present in this
Chamber as the Permanent Representative of Japan to the
United Nations and as the representative of his country on
the Security Council. I am sure that I speak for all
members of the Council in wishing our colleague all the
very best in his future endeavours. He will be greatly
missed in this circle, especially with respect to the keen
insight with which he has addressed the major issues
confronting the Security Council.
