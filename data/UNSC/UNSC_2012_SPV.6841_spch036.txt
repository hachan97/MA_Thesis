Mr. Elaraby: I would like to thank you very much
for Germany's excellent initiative in calling for this
meeting.

At this meeting we heard very important statements
by the 15 members of the Security Council. I hope that
members will consider basic matters, and not just the
general statements that we can hear everywhere. It is
important that we try to reach the core of the problems
and to see how we can resolve them.

With regard to the Syrian Arab Republic, as many
said today, the question is how to build upon what
was agreed upon in Geneva on 30 June. At the start
of the transitional period, the Security Council has to
act and to act according to Chapter VII of the Charter
of the United Nations. That has to be done. The five
permanent members of the Council have agreed upon a
text; let them build upon it.

With regard to Palestine, I would say only that
managing the conflict is no longer a solution; one has
to end the conflict. The Security Council gave up its
responsibility with regard to Palestine to something
called the Quartet. I did not mention it, but today
many speakers pointed out that we said last year that
something would happen this September. The month
is about to end and nothing has happened. It is time
that the Security Council takes the matter into its own
hands, debate it and see what can be done.
