The President: In accordance with rule 37 of the
Security Council's provisional rules of procedure,
I invite the representatives of Benin and Uganda to
participate in this meeting.

I wish to remind all speakers to limit their
statements to no more than four minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to circulate their statements in writing and
to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.

I now give the floor to the representative of Italy.
