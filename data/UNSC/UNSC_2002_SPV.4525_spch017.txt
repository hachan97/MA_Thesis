The President: There are a number of speakers
remaining on my list. With the concurrence of the
members of the Council, I intend to suspend the
meeting now in order to hear a briefing by the
Secretary-General in informal consultations. The
Security Council will continue its consideration of the
item on its agenda this afternoon following the
adjournment of the consultations of the whole.

The meeting was suspended at 4.40 p.m.
