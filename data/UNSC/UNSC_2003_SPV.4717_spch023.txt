The President (spoke in French): I thank the
representative of Australia for the kind words he
addressed to me.

Before giving the floor to the next speaker, I
should like to draw members' attention to the fact that
there are still 42 speakers inscribed on my list. After
two hours of debate, we have been able to hear only 11.
My hope is that we shall be able to hear the maximum
number of speakers this evening so that we can
conclude a bit earlier tomorrow. I renew the appeal I
made at the outset: I should like statements not to
exceed seven minutes' time. I thank members for their
understanding.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Canada. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
