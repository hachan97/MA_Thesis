Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
At the outset I would like to thank President Meron,
President Mose, Prosecutor Del Ponte and Prosecutor
J allow for their respective reports on the two Tribunals.
We have noted that currently both Tribunals are
actively taking measures to speed up the trials. China is
satisfied in this regard.

The establishment of the War Crimes Chamber of
the State Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina is indeed an
occasion for congratulations. Its establishment not only
will share the workload of the International Criminal
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) but is also
conducive to the implementation of the completion
strategy and the enhancing of the judicial capacity-
building of the countries in the region. We also endorse
the working principle of International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) to put the major
perpetrators of crimes on trail before the Tribunal
while transferring as many other suspects as possible to
the national judiciary institutions for trial.

In that connection we would like to thank the
various parties for their contribution to the
establishment of the War Crimes Chamber of the State
Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We also wish to
thank countries concerned for their assistance to the
expansion of the facilities of ICTR. We are happy to
see in the report that the countries concerned are
further enhancing their cooperation with ICTY. China
hopes this momentum will be maintained.

We have also noted that the two Tribunals are
conducting appraisals for their future work plans.
China will pay close attention to the relevant questions
that will impact implementation of the completion
strategy. We encourage all practices designed to
enhance efficiency and save resources. We believe the
implementation of the completion strategies remains
the steadfast objective of the Security Council.
