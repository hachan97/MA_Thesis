Mr. Matuszewski (Poland): Speaking on the
occasion of the Security Council debate concerning
resolution 1044 (1996), the Polish delegation expressed its
strong position on terrorism. We confirmed, in particular,
that the Government of the Republic of Poland condemns
terrorism in every form and that there are no
circumstances that could possibly justify its use. We also
made it clear that the accountability of those who
committed the acts of terrorism is a matter of primary
importance.

We regret to conclude that resolution 1044 (1996)
remains unheeded in what constitutes its main thrust -
namely, ensuring that those suspected of the terrorist
attempt on the life of President Mubarak are extradited
from the Sudan to Ethiopia to stand trial in a court of
law, which would demonstrate that the Government of the

 

Sudan is willing to respect the international community's
standards in dealing with terrorists.

The Polish delegation has voted in favour of the
resolution which the Security Council has just adopted. This
resolution contains a clear message to all those responsible
for allowing justice to be served, as appropriate. The
message is that the perpetrators of the acts of terrorism will
not go unpunished.

To conclude, let me also thank the Non-Aligned
Caucus for its work with regard to the resolution which has
been adopted this evening.
