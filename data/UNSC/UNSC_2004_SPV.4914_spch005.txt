The President (spoke in Chinese): I thank His
Excellency, Sir Emyr Jones Parry, Ambassador of the
United Kingdom, for his comprehensive briefing. As
there is no list of speakers, I invite those Council
members who wish to take the floor to so indicate to
the Secretariat as from now.

I now open the floor to the members of the Council
and give the floor to the representative of Algeria.
