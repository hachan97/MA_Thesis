Mrs. ngu (Nigeria): I want to thank Under-
Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing.

The ground invasion launched by Israel into
Gaza has led to a further escalation of the conflict
with Hamas. We regret that, despite the calls of well-
intentioned leaders around the world for a de-escalation
and restraint, the conflict has increased in both intensity
and scope. Indeed, this conflict has claimed numerous
lives, including those of women and innocent children.

While we recognize Israel's inherent right to
protect its citizens from attack, its response must be
proportionate to and in accordance with international
humanitarian law. The civilian toll on the Palestinian
side, especially the killing of women and children,
is simply unjustifiable. In the same vein, we urge
Hamas to put an immediate end to its indiscriminate
rocket attacks, which have terrorized Israelis and
disrupted their lives. Violence begets violence and
makes reconciliation almost impossible. We believe
that a de-escalation of the conflict is now urgently
required. That implies that the leaders of both sides
must demonstrate maximum restraint. Countries with
an influence on the warring parties should leave no
stone unturned to facilitate a return to the ceasefire of
November 2012.

It has been established that there can be no military
solution to the question of Palestine. The only path
to sustainable peace between Israel and Palestine
is through negotiations. The doors to a diplomatic
resolution must therefore remain open. We urge both
parties to embrace dialogue by reviving the stalled
peace talks. We reiterate our support for a two-State
solution, with both Israel and Palestine living side by
side in peace and security.
