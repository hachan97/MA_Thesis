The President: We have a very busy agenda, very
limited time and a presidential statement to issue.

Let me thank those nations that have agreed to
circulate their statements; I will ask the Secretariat to do so.
Those countries are Brazil, Cape Verde, Colombia, Eritrea,
India, Israel, Lesotho, Norway, Tanzania and the United
States. If any other nation wishes to distribute its statement,
we will be happy to do so.
