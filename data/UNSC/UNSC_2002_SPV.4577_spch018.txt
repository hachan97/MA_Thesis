Ms. McAskie: I am sorry that your troubles with
time did not spare me, Madam President, but I am
delighted to answer your question. The international
community has been very generous worldwide, and I
would not say that Sierra Leone has suffered any more
than other countries in crisis. But if I were to say that
there was a serious shortfall in Sierra Leone, I would
have to say that there were serious shortfalls in many
other crises as well. I think we could have done a lot
much sooner if more resources had been available, but
I would also say that it is also up to the international
agencies to be organized earlier. If one looks at our
response to more recent crises, the lesson that we have
learned is that we cannot allow these things to drag on
for years and years before we do something about
them. I think the response in Sierra Leone was horribly
slow on all levels; that is a major lesson we have
learned.
