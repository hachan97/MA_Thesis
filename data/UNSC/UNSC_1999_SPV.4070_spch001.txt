The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 6 of
Security Council resolution 1242 (1999), document
S/ 1999/ 1162 and corrigendum 1, and the letter dated 17
November 1999 from the Chairman of the Security Council
Committee established by resolution 661 (1990) concerning
the situation between Iraq and Kuwait (S/ 1999/ 1177).

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/ 1999/ 1180, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations.

It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/l999/1180) before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall
put the draft resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the voting.
