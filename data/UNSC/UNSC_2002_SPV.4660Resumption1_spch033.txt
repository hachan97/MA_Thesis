The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank Mr.
Oshima for his comments and the clarifications that he
has provided.

There are no speakers remaining on the list, but I
would like to take this opportunity, before concluding,
to thank all the delegations that have taken the floor in
this debate. The ideas and proposals made today are
very important. My country, Colombia, has an ongoing
interest in the protection of civilians in armed conflicts.
We will attentively follow the activities of the Security
Council, even after our participation on the Council has
ended. We are very grateful for having had this
opportunity to preside over today's meeting and the
very important discussions that took place.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 6.20 pm.
