The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Malta and Spain in which they
request to be invited to participate in the discussion of
the item on the Council's agenda. In accordance with
the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the
Council, to invite those representatives to participate in
the discussion without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Balzan
(Malta) and Mr. Arias (Spain) took the seats
reserved for them at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter dated 5 October
2000 from the Permanent Representative of Togo to the
United Nations, which will be issued as document
S/2000/958, and which reads as follows:

"On behalf of the Organization of African
Unity, I have the honour to request that the
Security Council extend an invitation to His
Excellency Mr. Amadou Kebe, Permanent
Observer of the Organization of African Unity to
the United Nations, to address the Council under
rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure
during the Council's consideration of the item
entitled 'The situation in the Middle East,
including the Palestinian Question'."

If I hear no objection, I shall take it that the
Council agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 to
Mr. Kebe.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of the Libyan Arab J amahiriya. I invite
him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his
statement.
