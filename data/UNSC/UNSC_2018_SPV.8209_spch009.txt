Ms. Eckels-Currie (United States of America):
The United States strongly supports the holding of
today's meeting and urges all Council members to
support the procedural vote in favour of proceeding
as planned today. The Russian Federation's continued
efforts to obstruct the Council's work and its attention
to grave and systemic human rights violations by
the Russian Federation's allies are appalling, and the
Council should not allow them to stand.
