The President: I thank the representative of Namibia
for his kind personal words.

I very much agree with the point the representative
made about Member States' complicity in the continuing
Angolan conflict, because Savimbi and UNITA'S arms,
munitions and fuel come through or over neighbouring
States and from other Member States. If they did not, he
would not have any supplies and the war would end.
