Ms. Del Ponte (spoke in French): I would like to
associate myself with President Meron's words of
thanks to the President and members of the Security
Council for their ongoing support. We certainly hope
that 2005 will be a successful year, especially in
connection with the arrests of persons with primary
responsibility, especially as regards the Srebrenica
genocide. I very much hope, 10 years after the
commission of that crime, that we will finally be able
to apprehend Mr. Karadzic' and Mr. Mladic' and begin
their trials.
