Mr. Fernandez (Central African Republic): This is
my first opportunity to address the Council since you, Sir,
assumed the office of the presidency. Permit me to
congratulate you. Your tenure of office is almost over, but
we have seen how you have performed with dignity,
expediency and a great sense of fair play. You have my
admiration and respect. I would like also to congratulate
your predecessor for a job very well done.

Obviously, in a democracy, it is important for the
Government and the opposition to work together and to
cooperate in furthering the interests of State. This must be
encouraged by the Council and all of us. We should be
careful, however, not to be seen as micromanaging the
Government and attempting to distribute ministerial
and/or parliamentary posts, as such an approach would
not be helpful.

Yesterday, the Constitutional Court rendered its
decision that those opposition members who defected to
the Government side have every right to do so. Therefore,
the majority of the President's party in government is
now official.

The Bretton Woods group that has been in our
country for the past two weeks has concluded its work
satisfactorily and has indicated to the Government its
agreement to reestablish economic cooperation with us.
This morning, I was informed that the first vice-
presidency of the National Assembly has been offered to
the opposition.

Once again, may I, on behalf of my Government,
take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the
Council for all the help rendered to us at this difficult
period of our history. Let me reassure the Council of my
Government's determination to fulfil all its obligations
under the Bangui Agreements, as well as the
commitments made by my President in his letter to the
Council.
