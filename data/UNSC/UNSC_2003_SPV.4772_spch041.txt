Sir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): The
United Kingdom associates itself fully with the
declaration made earlier on behalf of the European
Union by the Greek presidency.

My delegation has listened carefully to the views
expressed in the course of this open debate, not least
the views of the Secretary-General.

The United Kingdom has long been, and remains,
a strong supporter of the International Criminal Court
(ICC). We note with satisfaction that the number of
States Parties continues to grow, and we encourage
others to ratify, or accede to, the Statute.

While we understand United States concerns
about the International Criminal Court, we do not share
them. But those concerns, articulated forcefully in
2002, are still firmly held, and the implications for
Security Council-mandated and -authorized operations
remain the same as they were last year.
We regard Security Council resolution 1422
(2002) as an exceptional measure. It is not permanent;
nor is it automatically renewable. It is subject to
scrutiny in the Council, at least annually. We look
forward to the day when it or its successor will no
longer be required. But resolution 1422 (2002), and
now resolution 1487 (2003), are, in our View,
consistent with article 16 of the ICC Statute. The
Security Council accepted that unanimously on 12 July
2002. It does not undermine the Court; nor does it
infringe upon the integrity of the Rome Statute.

The same is true of the resolution we have just
voted on. The rollover it envisages will sustain the
ability of the United States to contribute to
international peacekeeping and other missions. The
provisions of the resolution remain deliberately narrow,
and there is no blanket immunity. Under the
circumstances, we regard the adoption of this
resolution as an acceptable outcome in what is for the
Council a difficult situation.
