Mr. Faour (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): First of all,
this meeting is devoted to the issue of Syrian refugees.
We are not here to conduct a political debate. That is a
general comment.

In addition, the Lebanese Government has chosen a
policy of keeping its distance from the Syrian crisis, but
we do have some comments that we would like to make.

With respect to the trafficking of weapons through
Lebanon by certain parties that are not official Lebanese
parties, the official Lebanese parties are doing
everything possible to stop any type of trafficking.
Lebanon does not want to be part of the Syrian crisis.
I would recall the historic request of Lebanon with
respect to the demarcation of borders and promoting
security at the borders. That has not been upheld, nor
has it been taken into consideration. On the contrary, in
the past, it has been denied.

With respect to the Latfallah I], I would recall that
the official Lebanese parties did seize that ship. There
are investigations under way on that matter, and thus
the legal and security sectors in Lebanon are carrying
out their duties. With respect to the other vessels, I
think they may be imaginary. We have not heard about
them.

The last issue I would raise is the idea that we are
complaining about the presence of Syrian refugees in
Lebanon. I think I was absolutely clear in that regard.
We are not complaining about Syrian refugees in
Lebanon. What we said is that the Syrian people hosted
some of the Lebanese people in 2006. This is a chance
to repay the favour to the Syrian people. We are not
complaining, nor are we asking for assistance in that
area. We chose to participate in this meeting on a
different basis, the humanitarian basis.
