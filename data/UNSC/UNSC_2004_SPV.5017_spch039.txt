Mr. Annabi: There were no specific questions, so
I will be very brief. I wish to make just two points.
First, I would like to thank Security Council members
and others who have expressed their appreciation for
the work done, under difficult circumstances, by the
outgoing Special Representative of the Secretary-
General, Mr. Harri Holkeri. I also wish to thank them
for the good wishes addressed to the new Special
Representative, Mr. Soren Jessen-Petersen. He will be
meeting in the next few days in Geneva with the senior
staff of the United Nations Interim Administration
Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) before proceeding to
Pristina to take up his assignment.

Secondly, I wish to advise members of the
Council that UNMIK is currently facing a very serious
financial situation. There are very significant delays in
the payment of assessed contributions to UNMIK. The
Secretariat has suggested, as a means of trying to
mitigate the effects of the situation, that we retain the
surpluses from peacekeeping operations that have been
completed. But as members are aware, that was not
accepted by the General Assembly, and as a result there
is very little or no flexibility for current missions that
are short of cash.

I would therefore like to take this opportunity to
stress the seriousness of the situation, which may lead
UNMIK, as early as next month, to curtail some of its
activities, and to urge all those concerned to promptly

pay their outstanding contributions in full and without There are no further speakers inscribed on my
