The President: I shall now make a statement in
my capacity as the representative of the United
Kingdom.

I should like to make six points. First, I associate
myself with the comments to be made soon by the
Italian presidency of the European Union. Secondly,
we encourage the very early launch of the Belgrade-
Pristina dialogue and look forward to practical
proposals from the Special Representative, who enjoys
our full support. Thirdly, normalization is the best way
forward. There is too much political rhetoric on both
sides. Unilateral attempts to pre-empt the status issue
are not helpful; resolution 1244 (1999) is the way
forward.

Fourthly, the immediate priority is standards. I
associate myself with those who say that it must very
clearly be "standards before status". It is important in
that respect to establish benchmarks. Fifthly, as we
gear up for those discussions between Pristina and
Belgrade, the security situation must be a priority.
Strengthening the rule of law and building the
indigenous capacity of the Kosovo Police Service are
vital if we are going to increase the role of, and
enforce, law and order.

My last point is simply to say that tackling
corruption, extremism and organized crime is a crucial
element in building up the multi-ethnic, prosperous
Kosovo that we seek. The United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo has got a lot of
work in hand on that issue, but it is quite striking that
the internal market in organized crime in that part of
the world is much more effective than is the internal
market in legitimate goods and services. That situation
has to be reversed if the region is to attain its goal of
approaching Euro-Atlantic standards.

I now resume my function as President of the
Council.

I have three speakers still on my list. The next
speaker is the representative of Serbia and Montenegro,
to whom I give the floor.
