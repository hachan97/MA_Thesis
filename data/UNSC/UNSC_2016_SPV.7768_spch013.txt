Mr. Okamura (Japan): Japan is very pleased to
have co-sponsored resolution 23 07 (2016), unanimously
adopted today. It is an enormous step forward for
Colombia's reconciliation and development after half
a century of conflict and four years of peace talks.
Japan would like once again to welcome the final
peace Agreement between the Government of
Colombia and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias
de Colombia - Ejercito del Pueblo (FARC-EP) on
24 August. We congratulate the parties on this historic
achievement for the good of the people of Colombia.
Japan particularly commends Cuba, Norway, Chile and
Venezuela for their contribution to the process.

We now turn to the essential work of
implementation. As was emphasized in resolution 2261
(2016), the people of Colombia must be true owners of
the Agreement. All parties should work together to the
process forward, but we, the international community,
also have a vital role to play through the United Nations
mission in Colombia. Having co-sponsored resolution
2261 (2016) and 2307 (2016), Japan fully supports the
mission. We look forward to the mission's success over
the course of the coming year.

Japan also underlines its continued commitment to
the political process and to the equitable and sustainable
socioeconomic development of Colombia, including
through the rehabilitation of victims and post-conflict
assistance, such as demining. After more than five
decades of conflict, Colombia is approaching a critical
phase in achieving national unity and overcoming its
remaining challenges, including the laying down of
arms and reintegration.

In Japan, we say that on a trip, just as it is reassuring
to have a companion, it is similarly important to support
each other on the journey through life. Japan pledged to
be such a companion to the people of Colombia as they
advance on their journey towards true reconciliation.
