Mr. J allow: I am taking the floor only to respond
to the question raised by the Permanent Representative
of France, who wished to know the number of files that
have been earmarked for transfer to national
jurisdictions.

Currently, the number stands at 45, as I indicated.
Of those 45, we have already handed over 30 to the
Government of Rwanda; those relate to people who
have not yet been indicted. The remaining 15 include
five who are currently in custody in Arusha and eight
who are at large; they have been indicted but have not
yet been arrested. That is the situation. It is very
probable that the number of those who have been
indicted and are at large will increase; therefore, that
category of cases for transfer may increase. That is the
scenario at the moment.

I would like to join the Presidents of the
Tribunals in thanking the President and the other
members of the Council for their support. It is a source
of great encouragement to us in our work.
