The President: I shall now put the draft
resolution to the vote.

A vote was taken by a show of hands.

In favour:
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
Colombia, France, Gabon, Germany, India,
Lebanon, Nigeria, Portugal, Russian Federation,
South Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland

Against:
United States of America

The President: There were 14 votes in favour
and 1 against. The draft resolution has not been
adopted, owing to the negative vote of a permanent
member of the Council.

I shall now give the floor to those members who
wish to make statements after the vote.
