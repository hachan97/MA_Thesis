Mr. Kalomoh: If elections were held on 12
October, we would have the necessary resources to
support them. I should say that that we have received
generous pledges. Some have been redeemed and some
have not because of the postponement uncertainties.
We have made arrangements to ensure that resources
provided for the elections have been managed by the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and
therefore respond to the legitimate concerns of the
donors that they might not be used for the purposes for
which they were given.

We promise that we will provide details about the
role we are playing and which fields of society we are
providing with assistance when we next brief the
Council. We have, however, been satisfied with the
response of the donors and with the management of
resources within the UNDP office in Guinea-Bissau.
