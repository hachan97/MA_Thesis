Mr. Terzi di Sant'Agata (Italy): I have the honour to
speak on behalf of the European Union. The following
Member States which are associated with the European
Union have expressed their intention of associating
themselves with this statement: Bulgaria, the Czech
Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland,
Romania and Slovakia.

The European Union expresses its grave concern at
the escalation of military activity in Israel and Lebanon,
which has resulted in the loss of many innocent lives and
has caused hundreds of thousands of civilians to flee their
homes. This is creating a major humanitarian crisis. The
European Union also expresses its concern about the
security of the United Nations peace-keeping force, the
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), and
calls on all sides to ensure that its safety is not put at
risk.

While reaffirming its commitment to the
implementation of resolution 425 (1978), the European
Union calls upon all parties to show the greatest
moderation and to cease military activities, in the
conviction that violence assists only the enemies of peace.
The European Union also calls on each party to the peace
process to use the influence at its disposal to contribute to
reducing tension in order to create a more relaxed climate
in the interests of all the peoples of the region.
