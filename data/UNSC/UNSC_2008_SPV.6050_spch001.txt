The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Somalia in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Dhakkar
(Somalia) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/796, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I wish to draw the
attention of members to document S/2008/769, which
contains the text of a letter dated 10 December 2008
from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee
established pursuant to resolution 751 (1992)
concerning Somalia, transmitting the report of the
Monitoring Group on Somalia.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
