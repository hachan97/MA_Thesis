Mr. Barros Melet (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): Let
me begin by thanking the delegation of Australia for
preparing today's resolution, as well as by welcoming
the flexibility shown by Member States in its
negotiation. The delegation of Chile sponsored and
voted in favour of resolution 2166 (2014), as we believe
that this is the appropriate response by the Council
and that it sends a clear message about the need for an
international investigation to be conducted that would
be full, exhaustive and independent to look into the
downing of Malaysia Airlines MH-l7, in keeping with
international law.

By its unanimous adoption the resolution, the
Security Council has taken an important and necessary
step towards clarifying facts and guaranteeing that
those responsible for this incident be held accountable
for their actions. This type of act cannot go unpunished.
The families of the victims have the right to know the
truth. That is why we once again urge all States, in
keeping with their obligations under international law
and under the relevant resolutions of the Council, to
actively cooperate with the relevant authorities.

On behalf of my country, I would like to reiterate
our solidarity and our most heartfelt condolences to the
families of the victims and to the Governments whose
citizens were among the victims of this event. We hope
that this terrible incident will serve as a reminder of
how this crisis affects countries and families beyond
the borders of Ukraine and of the need to resolve it.
