Mr. Llanos (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): We thank
Assistant Secretary-General Simonovie for his briefing
on the human rights situation in Ukraine.

Chile supports the appeal made by Mr. Simonovie
to ensure accountability for all human rights violations
committed during the demonstrations in Kyiv that took
place between December 2013 and February 2014.
It is crucial that immediate measures be adopted to
build trust between the interim Government and the
population, while taking into account ethnic minorities
in particular. Similarly, it is urgent to guarantee full
respect for the rule of law, democracy and human rights
in Ukraine, including the rights of all minorities.

We are particularly disturbed by the deterioration
of the human rights situation in the eastern region
of Ukraine, in particular violations of freedom of
expression and freedom of assembly through attacks
against and the harassment of activists, journalists
and members of the political opposition. We urge the
parties to find a peaceful solution to the crisis through
direct political dialogue, to act with moderation, to
abstain from adopting any unilateral measures that
may increase tensions and to take part in international
mediation efforts in accordance with General Assembly
resolution 68/262. We hope that the meeting to be held
tomorrow in Geneva, in which Ukraine, the Russian
Federation, the European Union and the United States
will take part, will help find a way out of the crisis.

I would conclude by welcoming the good offices
that the Secretary-General continues to carry out
and by highlighting the work of the United Nations
human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
on establishing the facts, reducing tensions and creating
an environment conducive to the holding of presidential
elections on 25 May.
