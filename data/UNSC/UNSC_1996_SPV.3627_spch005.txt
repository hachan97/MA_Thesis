The President: I thank the representative of the Sudan
for his kind words addressed to me.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to vote on the draft resolution before it. If I hear
no objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council who
wish to make statements before the voting.
