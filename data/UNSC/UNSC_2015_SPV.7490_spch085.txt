Mrs. Adnin (Malaysia): Malaysia is taking the
floor to exercise its right of reply to the comments and
allegations made by the representative of Israel.

I would first categorically reject the allegation
against my country made by the representative of Israel.
This is a malicious allegation aimed at tarnishing my
country's image. Such allegations have been made
before, and my Government has categorically rejected
any such ridiculous notion.

Our commitment to countering terrorism is not the
issue here. It is, rather, Israel's practice of terrorizing
helpless and defenceless Palestinian civilians that is the
issue now. I should also reiterate that Malaysia is not
an occupying Power, unlike Israel, which is roundly
condemned for its illegal practices related to its ongoing
occupation of the Palestinian and other Arab territories.

My delegation's position on the matter under
consideration has been made clear in our statement
delivered today. We would urge the Israeli delegation
to focus its energy on addressing the various concerns
raised by Malaysia and other Member States today,
instead of attempting to divert attention with false
allegations.
