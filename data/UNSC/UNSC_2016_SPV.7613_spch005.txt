Mr. Pressman (United States of America):
The United States fully supports the renewal of the
mandate of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in
Cyprus. We commend both Cypriot leaders for their
determination to make substantial progress towards
a comprehensive settlement to end the long-standing
division of the island and reunify Cyprus as a bizonal,
bicommunal federation.

As the Secretary of State of the United States,
Secretary Kerry, recently said at the World Economic
Forum, we are committed to supporting "the best
chance in decades to achieve a Cyprus settlement". The
United States is optimistic that a settlement agreement
can be achieved, but we know that this will require the
continued persistence of the two leaders, as well as
support from the international community, including
the Security Council.

It is unfortunate that the remarks of a member of
the Council have attempted to politicize this consensus
adoption. We urge all Council members to engage on
Cyprus free of ulterior political motives driven by
external factors, and in the best interest of the Cypriot
people.

The meeting rose at10.20 am.
