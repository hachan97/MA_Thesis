Mr. De La Sabliere (France) (spoke in French):
France voted in favour of the text submitted to a vote,
which seems to us to reflect the general message
expressed yesterday in the open debate. Violence and
terrorism must end. The decision to expel President
Arafat is against the law, politically counterproductive
and should not be implemented. The road map is the
best path possible and should be fully implemented by
both parties. The Quartet must pursue and intensify its
efforts.

We should have liked the Council to achieve
consensus on such a message. We regret the outcome
of the voting. It is a seriously counterproductive result.
