Ms. Menendez (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): We
too congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the
presidency of the Council. We also thank the
representative of Germany for his work as President
last month. We thank Mr. Danilo Turk for his briefing.
We also thank Mr. Sinclair, the Representative of the
Secretary-General, and his team, and we acknowledge
their work.

It is encouraging to note that the weapons
disposal plan is progressing apace and that 80 per cent
of the weapons contained in accordance with the
Bougainville Peace Agreement have been destroyed.
The participation of former combatants and of
communities in areas such as Panguna and southern
Bougainville is welcome.

Progress has been made on the preparation of the
new constitution. We hope that the Bougainville
Constitutional Commission will conclude its work
soon, with a view to convening the Constituent
Assembly, and that the approaching deadline will be
met. The same is true of the holding of free and
democratic elections to elect an autonomous
government in Bougainville.

The recent establishment of the Governance and
Implementation Fund, with key support from Australia,
is also decisive in making the elections and the
establishment of an autonomous government a reality.

Nonetheless, the process must go much further.
As the political process progresses, we must emphasize
the rehabilitation and reintegration of ex-combatants
and the restoration of infrastructure and community
services. Here, the United Nations Development
Programme has a fundamental role to play. We fully
trust that peace and stability will be consolidated in
Bougainville so that the peace process can be truly
successful.
