The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2010/14l, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations.
I should like to draw the attention of the members
of the Council to document S/2010/136, which
contains the text of a note by the Secretary-General
concerning the date of an election to fill a vacancy in
the International Court of Justice.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to adopt the draft resolution contained in document
8/2010/141 without a vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The draft resolution has been adopted as
resolution 1914 (2010).

The Security Council has thus concluded its
business for this meeting.

The meeting rose at 10.15 a.m.
