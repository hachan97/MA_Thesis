The President (spoke in Chinese): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of China.

The Chinese delegation welcomes the Foreign
Ministers of Jamaica and the Bahamas to our meeting
today. Their statements will be very useful in the
Council's consideration of this item. We completely
understand their anxiety and concern about the crisis in
Haiti. Their recommendations merit the Council's
serious consideration and study.

China is following closely the development of the
situation in Haiti and is gravely concerned at the heavy
casualties caused by the continued deterioration of that
situation. We urge all sides in Haiti to resolve the crisis
by peaceful means, through dialogue, in the best

interests of their people and their nation. All sides
should redouble their efforts to that end so as to
prevent further bloodshed and conflict.

We commend the Organization of American
States, the Caribbean Community and others for their
tireless efforts to press all Haitian parties forward to
break the current deadlock, and we support their
continuing to play an active role. We welcome the
Secretary-General's decision to appoint a Special
Adviser on Haiti.

We call on the international community to
provide the people of Haiti with emergency
humanitarian assistance. China will participate in the
international community's efforts to help ease the
current situation in Haiti and to attain lasting peace,
stability and development in that country.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

The next speaker is the representative of Ireland,
on whom I now call.
