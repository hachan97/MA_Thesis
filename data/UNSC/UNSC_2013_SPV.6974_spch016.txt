Mr. Bo Shen (China) (spoke in Chinese): I have
listened attentively to the briefing by Prosecutor
Bensouda.

The question of Darfur is a complex one, as it
involves many areas, including the political process,
security and stability, humanitarian assistance,
development, reconstruction and justice. The political
process is key among those elements. Only by promoting
sustained progress in the political process can lasting
peace at last be achieved in Darfur and the foundations
for justice and other efforts be laid.

The Doha Document for Peace in Darfur has
set out the approach for a comprehensive and proper
settlement of the Darfur issue. It forms the basis for
peace in the region. Its signatories, in particular the
parties in Darfur, should fully implement the Doha
Document. The armed rebel groups in question should
stop all forms of violence and sign peace agreements
on the basis of the Doha Document. All steps taken by
the international community on Darfur should serve to
promote the political process there and help achieve the
goals tho which I have referred. We hope that the ICC
will play a positive and constructive role to that end.

China's position on the ICC's involvement in the
question of Darfur remains unchanged. We hope that
the Council will attach due importance to that question
and pay heed to the views of such regional organizations
as the African Union and the League of Arab States.
