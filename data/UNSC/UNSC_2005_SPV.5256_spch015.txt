Ms. Loj (Denmark): I too wish to thank
Mr. Volcker for his briefing and his introduction of the
report of the Independent Inquiry Committee.
Likewise, I thank the Secretary-General for his
important statement.

During the coming days, Denmark will study the
wide-ranging findings and conclusions of the report.
We look forward to further discussions of the report.
However, our preliminary reaction is the following.

As expected, the report points to various
deficiencies in the management structures,
administrative procedures and accountability
mechanisms of the United Nations, which led to
serious incidents of abuse and corruption in the oil-for-
food programme. The report also makes clear that the
responsibility for the shortcomings of the programme
must be widely shared among Member States, private
companies and United Nations personnel. However, it
must not be overlooked that the report underlines that
the programme did contribute significantly to
alleviating the humanitarian suffering of the Iraqi
people. But, likewise, the report also underlines the
importance of successful administrative reform of the
United Nations.

Denmark has long supported proposals to reform
the management of the Organization. If the United
Nations is to have full credibility, it must have a
transparent, effective and accountable system for
managing its resources. We therefore note the
Commission's focus on the need for thorough
administrative reform and more reliable controls and
auditing, as well as strong executive leadership. The
responsibility to ensure that rests with the Member
States of the Organization - members of the Security
Council as well as members of the General Assembly.
The time has come, and it is short, for bold decisions
on reform of the management of the United Nations.
The summit next week must take such a decision.
