Mr. Aboulatta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Egypt
voted in favour of resolution 2266 (2016), which the
Council just adopted unanimously. Allow me to take
this opportunity to briefly reiterate the Egyptian
Government's position with regard to sanctions
regimes in general - as previously stated during our
statement delivered at the Council's open debate (see S/PV.7620 ) on general issues related to sanctions held
on 11 February - as well as Egypt's position with
regard to the ongoing crisis in Yemen.

First, on the work of Panels of Experts, it is
imperative that such panels operate within the mandate
specified by the Security Council resolutions that
established them, so as to preserve the resolutions'
credibility and that of the Council itself.

Secondly, also with regard to the work of the
panels, Egypt reiterates that it is vital that their final
reports maintain objectivity and impartiality, and for
those reports to rely exclusively on credible sources.
We wish to highlight paragraph 11 of the resolution
adopted today, which recalls the requirement I just
mentioned. We reiterate the importance of strictly
adhering to that in order, once again, to maintain
the Council's credibility as well as the credibility of
sanctions regimes.

Thirdly, as to the crisis in Yemen, we reaffirm
Egypt's position calling for a political settlement to the
crisis, in accordance with the relevant Security Council
resolutions, especially resolution 2216 (2015). Only a
political settlement will restore stability to Yemen and
complement efforts to combat terrorism in that country
in the Middle East region as a whole

The meeting rose at 10.10 am.
