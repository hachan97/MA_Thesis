The President: In accordance with rule 39 of
the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite
Mr. Staffan de Mistura, Special Envoy ofthe Secretary-
General for Syria, to participate in this meeting.

Mr. De Mistura is joining the meeting via video-
teleconference from Brussels.

The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda.

Recalling the Security Council's latest note 507 on
its working methods (S/2017/507), I wish to encourage
all participants, both members and non-members of the
Council, to deliver their statements in five minutes or
less. Note 507 also encourages briefers to be succinct and
to focus on key issues. Briefers are further encouraged
to limit initial remarks to 15 minutes or less.

I now give the floor to Mr. De Mistura.
