Mr. Pham (Viet Nam): We welcome the diplomatic efforts of the United Nations, Germany and other parties in convening the Berlin Conference on Libya. Given the fragile situation on the ground, it is vital for the Security Council to seize the momentum created in Berlin and support the implementation of the Conference's outcome. While resolution 2510 (2020) is not perfect, it represents a commitment on the part of the international community to strive towards a Libyan-led and Libyan-owned peace process to finally put an end to the conflict in Libya. Viet Nam therefore decided to vote in favour of resolution 2510 (2020). It is our sincere wish that the negotiations on issues of great importance to the international community and the countries concerned, such as in this case, address all concerns to ensure the unified position of the Security Council.
