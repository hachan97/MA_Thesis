The President (spoke in French): I would like to
thank Mr. Carl Bildt for having so eloquently drawn
the conclusions from a lengthy, high-quality and
forward-looking debate.

I have noted a feeling of optimism in this debate.
I have also taken note of the advice Mr. Bildt has just
given us. There will have to be other debates of this
nature because the international community as a whole
will, for many years to come, have to pay attention to
and assist the western Balkan region. The destiny of
that region is linked with that of Europe and, first and
foremost, with the European Union.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 4.45 p.m.
