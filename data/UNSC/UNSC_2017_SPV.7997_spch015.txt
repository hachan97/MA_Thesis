Mr. Inchauste Jordan (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): We thank Ms. Maria
Angela Holguin Cuellar, Minister for Foreign Affairs
of Colombia, for her presence in the Chamber today.

The Security Council has unanimously adopted
resolution 2366 (2017), establishing the United Nations
Verification Mission in Colombia to monitor the
implementation of the Final Agreement for Ending
the Conflict and Building a Stable and Lasting
Peace, demonstrating its unshakeable support for the
peace process in Colombia. Bolivia is proud to have
co-sponsored the resolution.

As we have noted previously, this process is
succceeding because the Government and the Fuerzas
Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Ejercito
del Pueblo (FARC-EP) are in ongoing dialogue
because their ultimate goal is peace. This attitude of
dialogue and understanding must now be maintained
and strengthened as we enter the most difficult part
of the process - the political, social and economic
reintegration of FARC-EP and the implementation of
personal and collective security guarantees. This phase
is a true challenge.

The killings of community leaders and human
rights champions linked to the guerrillas or their
families, dissidents who encourage hate speech and
non-reconciliation, the underground economy and other
factors are challenges that highlight the complexity of
the reintegration process. The Government and FARC-
EP have placed their trust once again in the Security
Council and the United Nations, and we welcome the
fact that the Council has demonstrated its unanimous
support for Colombia. We should like to see the process
held up as an example to the entire world.

We also wish to thank the current Mission, headed
by Special Representative of the Secretary-General
Jean Arnault and his team, for the commitment they
have shown to their work in the first stage. Their work is
critical and enjoys the unconditional support of Bolivia.
