Mr. Tang (Turkey): As we stated earlier today,
terrorism poses the greatest threat to security and stability
in the Middle East. Terrorists are trying to undermine the
hopes for peace and the prospects for prosperity. To
continue to work resolutely for peace requires common
understanding and cooperation among the countries of the
region. Combatting terrorism calls for common action.

It has been the consistent position of my Government
that the fight against terrorism is vitally important for the
success of the peace process. However, we also believe that
it should not inflict any harm on innocent civilians, who are
the real targets and victims of terrorist acts. If peace is to
triumph, the support of the people of the region must
continue. We are concerned that the recent developments
might lead to the loss of this support, and that this, in turn,
might cause a loss of momentum in the quest for peace.

After the attacks by the Israeli armed forces against
the positions of the terrorist organization, Hezbollah, in
Lebanon, the Israeli Ambassador to Turkey was summoned
by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Our position regarding
the fight against terrorism and our concerns for the safety
of innocent civilians have once again been brought to the
attention of Israel.

As a neighbouring country, Turkey will continue to
follow developments closely, and it calls for the
implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions.
