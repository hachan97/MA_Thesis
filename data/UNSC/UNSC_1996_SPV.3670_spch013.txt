Mr. Queta (Guinea-Bissau) (interpretation from French): Allow me to thank the Secretary-General for his
very complete report on developments regarding the

 

composition, strength and mandate of the United Nations
Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) in the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

We also wish to pay tribute to the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sokalski, as
well as to the civilian and military personnel of
UNPREDEP for their important preventive work in that
area.

We believe, as is indicated in the report of the
Secretary-General, that it is impossible to foresee with
certainty the consequences of a withdrawal of UNPREDEP,
given the present situation. That leads us to believe that
maintaining the Force, despite its cost, would be more
reasonable.

As its name indicates, UNPREDEP is a preventive
deployment force that plays a very important role in the
region, particularly during the current delicate phase of the
implementation of the Dayton Agreement and in the light
of regional threats.

It is in that context that Guinea-Bissau supports the
report of the Secretary-General, particularly with regard to
the extension of the UNPREDEP mandate for a new six-
month period and the maintenance of the status quo of that
Force, while still hoping that an improvement in the
situation in the country and the region may make it possible
to eventually reduce the personnel strength of UNPREDEP.

Guinea-Bissau will vote in favour of the draft
resolution before the Council.
