The President (spoke in Chinese): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Said Djinnit,
Special Representative of the Secretary-General and
head of the United Nations Office for West Africa.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Djinnit to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2009/682, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the United Nations Office for
West Africa.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Said Djinnit, to whom I now give the
floor.
