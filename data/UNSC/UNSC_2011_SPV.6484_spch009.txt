Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): My delegation
regrets that the Council was unable to adopt the draft
resolution before it today. South Africa voted in favour
of the draft resolution, as we joined those that believe
that the illegal Israeli settlement activity has become
an obstacle to moving the peace process forward.

The continued illegal settlement-building changes
the geographical composition of Palestine and has the
potential to render the desire to bring about a two-State
solution impossible, which is in line with the
overwhelming call for the creation of the sovereign,
independent, viable and contiguous State of Palestine,
coexisting peacefully alongside the State of Israel on
the basis of the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as
its capital.

The Council has an obligation to ensure that the
peace process moves forward and that a final
settlement can be reached between the parties. The
Council should therefore respond to obstacles, such as
the illegal settlement activity, which hampers the peace
process, and thus poses a threat to international peace
and security.

Despite the failure of the Council to act, the
peace process must move forward after today. Both
parties are still under the obligation to comply with
their previous agreements and obligations in terms of
the Quartet Road Map, which includes those on illegal
settlements. In that regard, we call on Israel to
immediately and completely cease all settlement
activities in the occupied Palestinian territory,
including Jerusalem.

The draft resolution called on the parties to
continue their negotiations on final status issues, which
include questions on Jerusalem, settlements, borders
and refugees. It is imperative that the parties do not
abandon the path of negotiations. We in the
international community have an obligation to support
the parties in their endeavour to reach that goal.
