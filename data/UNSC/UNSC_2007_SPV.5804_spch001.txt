The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of the Netherlands and Sierra Leone, in
which they request to be invited to participate in the
consideration of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the consideration of the item, without
the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Majoor
(Netherlands) and Mr. Rowe (Sierra Leone) took
seats at the Council table.

The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them document
8/2007/704, which contains the fifth report of the
Secretary-General on the United Nations Integrated
Office in Sierra Leone.

At this meeting, the Council will hear a briefing
by His Excellency Mr. Frank Majoor, Permanent
Representative of the Netherlands and Chairman of the
Sierra Leone country-specific configuration of the
Peacebuilding Commission. I now give the floor to
Ambassador Majoor.
