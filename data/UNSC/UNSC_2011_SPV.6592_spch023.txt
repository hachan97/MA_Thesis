The President: Let me remind the Council of the
lateness of the hour. Military people are known for
being succinct and to the point; I do not know if the
same can be said of us diplomats. I would appeal to the
Council to make the best use of the time available to
us, and to limit all our statements. We have another
seven Council members left to speak, and we should
limit our statements to what is absolutely necessary for
the remaining time.

Let me now turn to Major General Asarta Cuevas.
