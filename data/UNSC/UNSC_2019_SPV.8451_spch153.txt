The President (spoke in Spanish): I wish to thank
everyone, especially the briefers.

I think this has proved a good forum and a successful
debate, in which 82 representatives spoke, expressing
their views. Some countries still do not understand how
developing countries like ours feel. We live in fear that
we will either disappear or be hit by a natural disaster
that knocks our economies back 10 or 15 years. I hope
that we will continue raising our voices loud and clear
until they are heard.

The meeting rose at 6.15 pm.
