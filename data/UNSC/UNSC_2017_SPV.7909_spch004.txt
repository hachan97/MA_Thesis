Mr. Skoog (Sweden): On behalfofthe co-penholders
Sweden, Egypt and Japan, I would first like to thank
Under-Secretary-General O'Brien for his briefing and
his resolute commitment to keeping humanitarian
needs in Syria on the global agenda. I would also like
to pay tribute to all the humanitarian workers on the
ground.

Earlier this month, we passed the six-year mark of
the war in Syria. Six years in which the lives and dignity
of civilians have been assaulted on a daily basis; six
years in which the Council has failed to deliver on its
political and moral obligations to the Syrian people. The
scale of the humanitarian disaster has reached a level
that is difficult to appreciate fully. Syria's development
has been bombed backwards by four decades. Seven
million Syrians do not know where their next meal will
come from. Today the number of refugees in the region
has passed the 5 million mark.

Despite the fact that the United Nations-led talks
are well into their fifth round, and despite the fact that
the Astana ceasefire agreement has been in place for
three months, there has been no sustained progress
on humanitarian access. It is unacceptable that only
one besieged area was reached during the month of
February, according to the report we have just heard.
This week, however, four inter-agency convoys were
allowed to deliver their cargo, substantially increasing
the number of recipients for March, at least in hard-
to-reach areas. That shows us that it can be done.
The Council must not let this week be a one-off. We
must try to translate it into systematic and sustained
increased access, especially to besieged areas. We look
forward to discussing the more technical aspects of
how to achieve this with other Council members in the
consultations to be held today.
