Mr. Berger (Germany): By adopting resolution
1929 (2010), one year ago, the Security Council sent
out a strong signal of determination to resolve the
Iranian nuclear file. One important element of that
resolution was the establishment of the Panel of
Experts. Germany is of the View that the dual-track
strategy can only produce results if the existing
measures agreed by the Council are thoroughly
implemented.

The Panel of Experts has contributed
significantly to improving the implementation of
existing measures. Germany acknowledges the
professionalism and dedication of the eight experts. We
would like to seize this opportunity to express our
appreciation to the experts in the light of their
continued efforts to offer advice to the Council and the
Iran Sanctions Committee.

We therefore welcome the renewal of the
mandate of the Panel of Experts for 12 months.
Together with France, the United Kingdom and the
United States, we supported this resolution as a
co-sponsor. Germany is convinced that the Panel has
achieved important tasks. We area also of the view
that, as adopted, the text ensures the crucial
independence of the Panel. We would like to see the
Panel continue its work with the same degree of
professionalism as in the past.

Let me conclude by highlighting that, together
with our partners in the international community, we
remain committed to finding a long-lasting and
peaceful solution to the Iranian nuclear file.
