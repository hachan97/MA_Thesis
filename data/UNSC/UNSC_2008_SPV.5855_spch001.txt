The President (spoke in Russian): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Argentina, Australia, Cuba,
India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Israel, Japan,
Mexico, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey and the Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela, in which they request to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In accordance with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
consideration without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, the
aforementioned representatives took the seats
reserved for them at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The President (spoke in Russian): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to the Executive
Director of the Counter-Terrorism Committee
Executive Directorate, Mr. Mike Smith.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Smith to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

I wish to draw the attention of the members of the
Council to document S/2008/80, which contains the
text of a letter dated 7 February 2008 from the
Chairman of the Security Council Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1373 (2001)

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by the Executive Director of the Counter-
Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate, Mr. Mike
Smith. I now give him the floor.
