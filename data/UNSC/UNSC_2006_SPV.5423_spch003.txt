Mr. Al-Bader (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): In the
Committee established pursuant to resolution 1591
(2005) we did not get clear and consistent evidence
that would condemn those individuals in the way
required for imposing sanctions on them in accordance
with the Committee's measures and guidelines. We
have frequently stated that we are ready to take note of
any piece of proof available, as we are committed to
the relevant resolutions and guidelines applicable
within the Committee.

We are of the view that it is our duty to leave any
such accusations to the prosecutor of the International
Criminal Court to deal with and not to influence any
investigations being carried out or that may be carried
out in this respect.

This is why our decision to abstain was based on
resolutions 1591 (2005) and 1593 (2005), as well as on
the Committee's procedures. We consider the
Committee to be the technical and legal specialized
body entrusted with producing recommendations to
impose sanctions.

In addition, given the positive report of
Mr. Salim, African Union Special Envoy for the Inter-
Sudanese Peace Talks on Darfur, and given the positive
developments in the Abuja process, we thought that it
would not be suitable to adopt this kind of resolution at
this particular juncture and that it would be preferable
to postpone the vote until after the end of the Abuja
process on 30 April 2006. It is for all of these reasons
that Qatar abstained during the vote.
