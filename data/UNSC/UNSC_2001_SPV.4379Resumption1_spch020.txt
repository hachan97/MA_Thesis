The President (spoke in French): I thank Mr.
Jacques Paul Klein for his brief comments.

We have come to the end of this long meeting. I
would like, on behalf of the Council, to express my
very warm thanks to Mr. Wolfgang Petritsch and Mr.
Jacques Paul Klein. All of us here have been able to
appreciate the sometimes slow but steady progress that
has been made day by day in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
As we heard them speak we were also able to
appreciate the role of two men in charge of ensuring, in
their respective posts, that Bosnia and Herzegovina
makes progress towards a European future, which is
what we wish for it.

There are no other speakers inscribed on my list.
The Security Council has thus concluded this stage of
its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 4.45 pm.
