Mr. Fowler (Canada): The representative of India
made reference to the fact that three vetoes had been cast
in this morning's voting. I would simply like to point out,
as the representative of a country that is rather sensitive
about the issue of the veto, that my understanding is that
the rules are very clear. There were no vetoes cast this
morning. A veto is cast only when it overrides nine
positive votes, and that was not the case this morning.
