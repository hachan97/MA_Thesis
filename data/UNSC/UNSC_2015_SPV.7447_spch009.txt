Mr. Van Bohemen (New Zealand): New Zealand
has supported today's resolution 2220 (2015) in both its
concept and its details since Lithuania first proposed it.
We see the resolution as important because ofthe gains
it makes in an area too little discussed by the Security
Council. We thank Lithuania for taking forward the
initiative initially taken by Australia in resolution 2117
(2013).

As the President has enumerated, the resolution
operationalizes small arms in many facets of the
Council's work and encourages wider adherence to the
Arms Trade Treaty, one of the most important arms
control treaties adopted in recent years. The resolution
will also ensure that small arms have more than a
temporary place on the Security Council agenda.

Sadly, over the last week the issue of small arms
and light weapons itself has become secondary to a
highly politicized debate. We have some sympathy for
the position of the three African States that wanted
an explicit reference to transfers to non-State actors.
New Zealand does not support the illicit transfer of
arms to non-State criminal and armed groups. We
could have accepted any of the formulations under
discussion. We believe that a solution could have been
found if delegations on both sides of the debate had
focused on the words on the page and had taken a less
positional approach to the negotiations. We are pleased
nonetheless that the resolution has been adopted with
the sponsorship of a wide range of Members of the
Organization.
