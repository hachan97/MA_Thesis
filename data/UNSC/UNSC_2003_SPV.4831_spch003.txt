The President: May I take it that the draft report,
as corrected, is adopted by the Council?
There being no objection, it is so decided.

This decision will be reflected in a note by the
President of the Security Council, to be issued as
document S/2003/893. The note reads as follows:

"At its 483lst meeting, held on 19
September 2003, the Security Council considered
its draft report to the General Assembly covering
the period from 1 August 2002 to 31 July 2003.
The Security Council adopted the draft report
without a vote."

The Security Council has thus concluded its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at H a.m.
