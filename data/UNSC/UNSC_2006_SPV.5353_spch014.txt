Mr. Brencick (United States of America): My
delegation too would like to thank High Commissioner
Guterres for his incisive and forceful briefing this
morning. We believe that he is off to a very strong start
in his very challenging position; rather than add to
those challenges by lengthening the daunting list of
good questions already posed by my colleagues, I will
confine myself to a few remarks.

The United States is a strong supporter of the
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) and the multilateral approach to
serving refugees. We rely heavily on UNHCR to ensure
that the protection and assistance needs of refugees are
met, in coordination with other United Nations,
international and non-governmental organization
partners in the field. For that reason, we plan to
continue our generous financial support for the work of
UNHCR.

As other Council members have noted, we are
following closely the efforts to reinvigorate the
collaborative approach of the United Nations to
meeting the needs of internally displaced persons
through the designation of agencies as cluster leads for
various sectors. Such reform is long overdue. I would
like to note, however, our concern that UNHCR work
to ensure that its involvement with internally displaced
persons not detract in any way from its mission to
assist refugees.

We look forward to continuing to work with the
Office of the High Commissioner in order to improve
the United Nations response to humanitarian crises,
including greater accountability in its work.
