Mr. Brencick (United States of America): We
welcome as well the presence of Foreign Minister
Ramos-Horta with us today and appreciate the briefing
of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General,
Mr. Hasegawa, and his continuing efforts to build a
lasting peace and the basis for sustainable development
in Timor-Leste. We are, like others around this table,
concerned by recent developments in Timor-Leste. We
urge all parties to settle their disagreements by
peaceful dialogue, to protect the lives and property of
all persons in Timor-Leste and to maintain strict
adherence to the Constitution and laws.

In that context, and given the very recent unrest
and violence and lingering fears of perhaps more, and
despite the current calm, we do not believe that the
proposed follow-on plan for a post-UNOTIL special
political mission, however well thought out, is, at this
point, timely. My delegation suggests that the Security
Council consider and approve a simple one month
rollover of the existing mandate of the UNOT IL
mission until 20 June. This one-month extension will
give the situation in East Timor fully enough time to
settle and will allow Council members to get a better
idea of exactly what may be needed in any follow-on
mission and discuss how best to provide it.
