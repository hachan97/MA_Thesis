Mr. Alotaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): The
representative of Syria mentioned Kuwait while
levelling many accusations against Kuwaiti parties and
institutions. He usually makes such accusations during
his statements, and he has the right to do so. However,
it is also our right to reply.

Those accusations are baseless. He mentioned that
the Salafist movement in Kuwait supports a faction
known as the Huras Al-Din. It is the first time that
we are hearing about such a movement. There is no
Salafist movement in Kuwait that supports any faction.
We have charities with specific religious affiliations.
But the Kuwaiti Government can confirm that they are
not involved with any terrorist group, whether in Syria
or elsewhere. Those charities provide funding only for
humanitarian purposes, similar to what the Government
of Kuwait does with regard to the situation in Syria.
The humanitarian dimension gets our priority. That is
why Kuwait hosted three international conferences.
We are still one of the first countries to support the
humanitarian operations of the United Nations in Syria
in support of Syrian refugees and displaced persons.
