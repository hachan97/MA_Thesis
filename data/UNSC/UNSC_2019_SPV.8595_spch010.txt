Mr. Cohen (United States of America): I thank
Assistant Secretary-General Keita for her sobering
briefing today.

The United States strongly condemns the attack
in Benghazi that killed and injured United Nations
staff members and a number of civilians. We extend
our condolences and sympathies to the victims, their
families and indeed the entire United Nations family.

Today's violence in Benghazi underscores the
need for an immediate reduction in violence and a
prompt return to the United Nations-mediated political
process. We welcome the United Nations Special
Representative's call for a truce and commitments from
the Libyan parties to halt military activities during the
Bid Al-Adha holiday. All sides should now take durable
steps to de-escalate and reduce the ongoing violence
and to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure. We
urge the sides to support confidence-building measures
also proposed by the Special Representative as steps
that could lead to a sustainable ceasefire and inclusive
dialogue. We also urge both sides to allow humanitarian
access via protected corridors.
As it has often been repeated in the Security
Council Chamber, durable peace in Libya requires a
political solution.
