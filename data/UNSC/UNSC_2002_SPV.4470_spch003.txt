The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Mr. Lubbers for the realistic perspective and the
information that he has provided to the Council. I
would like to congratulate him and his staff on the
dedicated humanitarian work that they have been doing
to benefit the 21 million refugees throughout the world.

I will now call on Council members for their
comments or questions relating to Mr. Lubbers'
statement. In order to make this meeting more
interactive, I will call on several Council members
before reverting to Mr. Lubbers for his response.
