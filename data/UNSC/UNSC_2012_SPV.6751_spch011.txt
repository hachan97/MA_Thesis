Mr. Menan (Togo) (spoke in French): My
country welcomes the Security Council's unanimous
adoption today of resolution 2042 (2012), on Syria.
This is an important event in the light of the fact that
several times in the past the Council has failed to speak
with one voice on the serious crisis in Syria. The
adoption of this resolution constitutes still greater
support by the Council to the mission led by Joint
Special Envoy of the United Nations and the League of
Arab States Kofi Annan, reinforcing its presidential
statement of 5 April (S/PRST/2012/10).

Today the Council has authorized the deployment
of a limited observer team to Syria to monitor the
cessation of violence by all parties, so as to facilitate
the immediate and full implementation of the Joint
Special Envoy's six-point plan, which entered into
force on 12 April. In doing so, the Council has
demonstrated its engagement and resolve to work as
one to find a timely and lasting solution to the crisis
that Syria has lived under for more than a year. My
country strongly supports the implementation of the
terms of the resolution by all parties. We take this
opportunity to renew our support for Mr. Arman and his
team.

The Syrian people have long awaited such an
action from the Security Council. It is therefore
important that all of its members - especially those
that hold some sway with the Government or any
element of the opposition - work to promote the
resolution's implementation. The resolution should
pave the way towards an inclusive political process,
involving all Syrians in building a free, peaceful and
prosperous nation.
