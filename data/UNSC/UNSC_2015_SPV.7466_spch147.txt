Mr. Kvelashvili (Georgia): I thank the President
for allowing my delegation to take the floor for a second
time. I am responding to the statement by the Russian
Federation, in particular the part of the statement
regarding Georgia. I want to repeat the words just
spoken by my Ukrainian colleague. Russia just has to

As for the so-called normalization of relations
with the occupation regime that Russia established
on Georgian soil in 2008, Russia engaged in a war of
aggression against Georgia - the same type of war that
we now see in Ukraine. After the war of aggression,
Russia established an occupation regime. So how can
we normalize relations with a regime that is part of a
bigger problem, namely, the Russian Federation itself?

of children under Russian occupation. The Georgian
children living under Russian occupation are being
prevented from exercising their fundamental rights. In
particular, a Russian curriculum is being imposed on the
Georgian schools in the occupied territories. Teachers
are promised a salary only if they teach according to
a curriculum approved by the Russian State. Teachers

reality on the ground 7 at least part ofthe reality. The meeting rose at 7'35 p.m.
