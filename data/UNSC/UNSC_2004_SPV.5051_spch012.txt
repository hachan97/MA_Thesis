Mr. Yafiez-Barnuevo (Spain) (spoke in Spanish):

In our debate on this question yesterday, my delegation
had an opportunity to express its views on the gravity
of the situation in the Middle East, and particularly in
the Gaza Strip. At that time, we expressed all our
views on this issue, which means that I need not speak
at length now. I said that, on the basis of the principles
and statements made, we would cast a vote on the draft
resolution to be submitted by some delegations.

After considering the draft resolution submitted
by the delegations of Algeria, Pakistan and Tunisia, my
delegation voted in favour of it. We regret that it could
not be adopted by the Council. We consider that the
draft resolution contains elements that are essential for
dealing with the situation, especially in light of the
gravity of events and the urgency with which a
response must be given. Not only does the text make
reference to the need for a cessation of military
operations and a withdrawal of Israeli forces from the
Gaza Strip, it also condemns all acts of violence, terror,
the excessive and indiscriminate use of force and the
physical destruction that has occurred. It calls as well
for an end to the violence and for parties to respect all
their obligations, particularly those proceeding from
international humanitarian law. We regret that the
Security Council has been unable, in this instance, to
shoulder the responsibilities it bears under the Charter,
and we maintain that this situation will have to remain
under consideration. Meanwhile, both parties must
comply with the obligations they have entered into
within the context of the road map and must cooperate
closely with the Quartet of international intermediaries.
