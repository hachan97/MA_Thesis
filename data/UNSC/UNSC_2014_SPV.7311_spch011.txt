Mr. Laro (Nigeria): I thank the briefers for their
statements.

We are concerned by the escalating violence and
mounting civilian casualties in eastern Ukraine. The
constant shelling, the fragile security situation, the
teetering economy and an atmosphere of uncertainty
are obstacles to the attainment of peace in the region.
Strict adherence by all parties to the provisions of the
Minsk protocol and the memorandum of 19 September
is vital and urgent. We call on all concerned to keep
genuine channels of communication open and take
concrete steps to consolidate the ceasefire agreement.
We emphasize that there can be no military solution to
the crisis.

The elections conducted on 2 November in the
separatist republics of Donetsk and Luhansk run counter
to the spirit ofthe Minsk protocol and pose a threat to the
peace, unity and sovereignty of Ukraine. Although the
Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe recently stated that the
elections would further complicate the implementation
of the Minsk protocol, and we share that View, we urge
all concerned, and in particular nations with influence
over the parties, to continue to facilitate dialogue with a
view to easing tensions, de-escalating the violence and
ultimately arriving at a peaceful solution to the crisis.
We would like to see Ukraine return to normalcy and
its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity
respected, in accordance with the Charter of the United
Nations.
