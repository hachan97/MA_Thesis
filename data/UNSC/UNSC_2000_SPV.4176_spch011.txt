The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Norway, Sierra Leone and Uganda in which
they request to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the discussion without the right to
vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Mukongo
Ngay (Democratic Republic of the Congo), Mr.
Kolby (Norway), Mr. Kamara (Sierra Leone) and
Mr. Semakula Kiwanuka (Uganda) took the seats
reserved for them at the side of the Council
Chamber.
