Mr. Denisov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): May I thank the Chairman of the Security
Council Committee established pursuant to resolution
1540 (2004), the Permanent Representative of Romania
to the United Nations, Ambassador Motoc, for his
detailed briefing on the initial results of the work of the
Committee he chairs. The documents recently adopted
by the 1540 Committee organizing its activity and the
approval of the group of experts will enable the
Committee to get down to the practical work assigned
to it by the Council, namely analysing the national
reports of States on measures to implement resolution
1540 (2004).

I would like to join in the appeal by the
representative of France to countries that have not yet
submitted their reports to submit them as soon as
possible. Having weapons of mass destruction fall into
the hands of non-State entities primarily for terrorist
purposes is one of the major threats to international
peace and to the national security of States. We are
convinced that the struggle against the proliferation of
such weapons must be waged on a collective basis,
strictly in accordance with the rules of international
law. We also believe the 1540 Committee must work in
close coordination and collaboration with the expertise
of leading organizations and structures that are active
in non-proliferation, primarily such organizations as
the International Atomic Energy Agency and the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

Later, one might think about following a practice
similar to that of the Counter-Terrorism Committee of
the Security Council, namely to hold regular meetings
between the 1540 Committee and relevant regional and
international organizations.
