The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Azerbaijan. In accordance with rule
37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I
invite the representative to participate in this meeting.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I wish to remind all speakers to limit their
statements to no more than four minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.

I shall now give the floor to the representative of
Australia.
