Mr. Umarov (Kazakhstan): Kazakhstan abstained
in the voting today on draft resolution S/2018/355
because we believe that all disputes among States should
be resolved through peaceful dialogue and constructive
negotiations on the basis of equal responsibility for
peace and security. As I mentioned in my statement
earlier today, we call for all parties to refrain from
actions that could aggravate tensions and cause the
situation to spiral out of control.
