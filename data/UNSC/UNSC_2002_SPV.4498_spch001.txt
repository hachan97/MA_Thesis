The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Spain and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, in which they request to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In accordance with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions ofthe Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

On behalf of the Council, I extend a warm
welcome to His Excellency Mr. Nebojea Covie,
Deputy Prime Minister of the Yugoslav constituent
Republic of Serbia and President of the Coordination
Centre of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the
Republic of Serbia for Kosovo and Metohija.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Covie
(Yugoslavia) took a seat at the Council table and
Mr. Arias (Spain) took the seat reserved for him
at the side of the Council Chamber.

The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Hedi Annabi, Assistant Secretary-
General for Peacekeeping Operations.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Annabi to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

At this meeting, the Council will hear a briefing
by Mr. Hedi Annabi, Assistant Secretary-General for
Peacekeeping Operations. After the briefing, I shall
open the floor to members.
I now give the floor to Mr. Annabi.
