Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): We, too, join in
thanking Under-Secretary-General Pascoe for his
briefing on the unfolding situation in Syria, about
which South Africa is very concerned. We regret the
loss of life in Syria and call on all parties to the
conflict to show restraint. We welcome the lifting of
the state of emergency, which had been in place for
almost 50 years. We also welcome the adoption of
other reforms introduced by the Syrian authorities over
the past few days. We urge the Government of Syria to
move swiftly to implement the necessary reforms
towards democratization, in accordance with the will
and aspirations of its people.

The voices of people in Syria and other countries
in the Middle East and North Africa cannot be ignored.
It is important for their Governments to ensure that the
rights of their people are protected and that they be
allowed to voice their grievances peacefully. Syria is
integral to a wider resolution of the Middle East
conflict; its stability is linked to that of its neighbours.

Finally, we urge the Syrian authorities to initiate
an open, transparent and all-inclusive process with
their people in order to address their grievances and, in
turn, guarantee their fundamental political rights and

freedoms, including their rights to freedom of
assembly and freedom of speech.
