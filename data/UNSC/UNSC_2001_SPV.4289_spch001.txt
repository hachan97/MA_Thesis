The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I received letters from the representatives
of Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Slovenia,
Sweden, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
and Yugoslavia, in which they request to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

On behalf of the Council, I welcome the Minister
for Foreign Affairs of the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, His Excellency Mr. Srgj an Kerim.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Kerim (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) took a
seat at the Council table.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Nesho
(Albania), Mr. Sotirov (Bulgaria), Mr. Simonovic
(Croatia), Mr. Gounaris (Greece), Mr. Petric
(Slovenia), Mr. Schori (Sweden) and
Mr. Mladenovic (Yugoslavia) took the seats
reserved for them at the side of the Council
Chamber

The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in response to the request contained
in the letter dated 4 March 2001 from the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia addressed to the
President of the Security Council (S/200l/191).

I give the floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
Mr. Srgjan Kerim.
