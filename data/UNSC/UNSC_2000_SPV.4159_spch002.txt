The President (Spoke in French): I very warmly
thank Mr. Amama Mbabazi, Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs and for Regional Cooperation of
Uganda and Chairman of the Political Committee for
his important statement, the positive nature of which
each one of us has been able to see. I suggest that the
Mission of Uganda to the United Nations ask that this
statement be distributed as a document of the Security
Council.
