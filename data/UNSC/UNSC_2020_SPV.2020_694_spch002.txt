The United Kingdom expresses its continued thanks to the German and Belgian delegations for their determined and principled efforts to ensure that the United Nations and humanitarian partners are able to meet the needs of millions of people in Syria. The United Kingdom voted against the Russian draft resolution (S/2020/683) that would close the Bab Al-Salam border crossing into north-western Syria, depriving 1.3 million people of the cross-border aid they rely on. We regret that Russia also insisted on including language on sanctions. Members of the Council have repeatedly made clear that sanctions do not apply to food or medicine. There are also exemptions for humanitarian activity in place for United Kingdom-European Union sanctions. The actions of the Syrian regime are the main driver of the dire humanitarian situation in Syria. We remain deeply disappointed by Russian and Chinese politicization of this humanitarian issue. The outcome of this vote makes clear that a majority of Council members share our concerns. Russia and China have now twice vetoed texts that would have met the humanitarian needs of those in north-western Syria and which had the support of all other Security Council members. We urge Russia and China to reconsider their approach and support a compromise solution, coming together with the rest of the Council in the name of humanity.
