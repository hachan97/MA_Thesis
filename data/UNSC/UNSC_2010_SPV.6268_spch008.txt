Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
welcome His Excellency Mr. Kanat Saudabayev,
Foreign Minister of Kazakhstan, to the Security
Council and thank him for his briefing on the activities
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE). I wish Kazakhstan success during its
chairmanship of the OSCE.

While the Security Council bears primary
responsibility for the maintenance of international
peace and security, it must strengthen its cooperation
with regional and subregional organizations. That is an
important way by which the international community
can unite efforts to respond to crises and challenges.
China supports the strengthening of cooperation
between the Security Council and regional and
subregional organizations on the basis of Chapter VIII
of the Charter of the United Nations.

Last month the Security Council organized a
thematic debate on cooperation between the United
Nations and regional and subregional organizations in
maintaining international peace and security and issued
a presidential statement (S/PRST/2010/l) in which the
importance and necessity of the United Nations

carrying out mutually reinforcing and complementary
cooperation was reaffirmed.

Today's briefing by the Foreign Minister
Saudabayev to the Security Council on the activities of
the OSCE will help to strengthen communication and
coordination between the Security Council and the
OSCE and will improve the effectiveness of
cooperation in maintaining international peace and
security. We hope that during Kazakhstan's
chairmanship of the OSCE, the organization will be
able to fully utilize its advantages and resources to
promote a more effective and active role in maintaining
regional peace, stability and security.
