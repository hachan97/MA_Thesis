The President: To speak briefly in my national
capacity, Ambassador Menon referred to a press
conference held by a senior Secretariat official, and I
would just ask Mr. Mark Malloch Brown to indicate,
when his time comes to respond, if he would not agree
that he asked that senior United Nations official to hold
that press conference.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Austria.
