Ms. Wronecka (Poland): Allow me to take this
opportunity to thank France for its excellent work
during the negotiation of resolution 2502 (2019).

Over the past year, the Democratic Republic
of the Congo has achieved an important political
transformation, and that effort is appreciated. Poland
welcomes the fact that the Security Council was able
to maintain a constructive position on the extension
of the mandate of the United Nations Organization
Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic ofthe
Congo (MONUSCO) and adhere to its main priorities.
We believe that this will help the Government to
increase the State's ability to provide minimum
conditions for the gradual transfer of responsibilities
from MONUSCO to the national authorities in the
future. The neutralization of armed groups and the
reduction of intercommunal violence remain necessary
conditions for improving the security situation and
ensuring respect for human rights in the country. In
that regard, we believe that the implementation of the
crucial disarmament, demobilization and reintegration
programme should be complemented by the community
violence reduction approach. It is essential that more
emphasis be put on the civilian and police components
of the Mission, which would not only support dialogue
and mediation at the central and local levels but also
promote the inclusiveness of the political process.

Looking ahead, it is of the utmost importance
that the Security Council remain in a constructive,
honest and open dialogue with the authorities about the
prospects of the United Nations presence in the country.
Poland hopes that future Security Council decisions in
that regard will be based on reality on the ground so that
two decades of United Nations peacekeeping efforts in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo are not lost.
Let me end by expressing our gratitude for the
tireless efforts of the entire MONUSCO team to support
peace, security and stability in the country.
