The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the
representative of Egypt for the kinds words he
addressed to me. I am very pleased indeed to be
presiding.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Israel. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
