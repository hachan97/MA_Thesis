Mr. Mitri (Lebanon): It pains me to hear the
reference to Tyre cited from the Bible. Tyre is now a
city of desolation. Tyre has been bombarded and
pounded almost uninterruptedly for the past 10 days or
so. King Hiram of Tyre sent cedar trees to build, and
the Israelis are destroying Tyre today. It pains me to
hear the reference to Tyre at this point in time.

The "campaign against terror", as the Israelis like
to call their all-out war against Lebanon, has been
perceived, felt and lived by the Lebanese as horror -
nothing but horror. In Israel's wanting to destroy the
infrastructure of terrorism, as we heard, it is the
infrastructure of Lebanon that is destroyed.

All in this body know that, in international law,
there are two principles regarding civilians: the
principle of distinction and the principle of
proportionality. I am afraid that those two principles
have been systematically violated since 12 July. Be that
as it may, I will end with these few words.

I am here - we are all here - to find a way out.
Yesterday's proposal by our Government is a viable
option and should be looked at as a viable option. It
allows for a true and effective cessation of hostilities.
It will lead to a durable ceasefire. It opens the way
forward: it opens the way forward towards a more

durable solution. I hope that the opportunity that this
option offers is not missed.
