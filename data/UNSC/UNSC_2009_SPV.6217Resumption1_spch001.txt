The President: I wish to remind all speakers, as I
indicated at the morning's session, to limit their
statements to no more than five minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to circulate the texts in writing and to deliver
a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.

I now give the floor to the Permanent
Representative of New Zealand.
