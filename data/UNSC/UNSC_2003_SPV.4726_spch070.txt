Mr. Vohidov (Uzbekistan) (spoke in Russian):
The Republic of Uzbekistan notes with regret that the
non-compliance of the Iraqi regime over the past 12
years with Security Council resolutions, including
Council resolution 1441 (2002), has led to the current
conflict. Under such circumstances, we can only
cherish the hope that the conflict will end as soon as
possible with minimum suffering and loss of human
life. Uzbekistan strongly favours the disarmament of
Iraq. Unfortunately, the latest events in Iraq have
destroyed the consensus in the Security Council. From
our standpoint, the disagreements which have arisen in
the Security Council should not blind us to the main
task, which is the need for the complete disarmament
of the Iraqi regime, including the threat of chemical
and biological weapons in the hands of terrorists.

The humanitarian situation in Iraq is getting
worse each day. The international community should
take urgent measures to improve this situation,
including guaranteeing drinking water, food, electricity
and basic necessities for the Iraqi population. In this
context, Uzbekistan calls upon the Security Council to
continue, as soon as possible, the United Nations oil
for food programme in order to prevent a humanitarian
catastrophe in Iraq which would cause the suffering,
first and foremost, of the Iraqi people. The
humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people should be met
as soon as possible.

In this regard, Uzbekistan fully supports the
proposal of the Secretary-General of the United
Nations, that he be given authorization to provide
urgent humanitarian assistance, on behalf of the
international community, to Iraq.

In conclusion, Uzbekistan supports the efforts
directed at restoring the effectiveness and unity of the
Security Council in settling the situation around Iraq,
something which is extremely important for
strengthening the authority and universal role and
significance of the United Nations in international
relations.
