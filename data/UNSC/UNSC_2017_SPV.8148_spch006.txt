Mr. Lie Cheng (China) (spoke in Chinese): In
recent years, returning and relocating foreign terrorist
fighters have launched terrorist attacks in many parts
of the world, seriously threatening the security and
stability of countries of origin, transit and destination.
All Member States should enhance cooperation in order
to bring to justice foreign terrorist fighters who have
been involved in terrorist attacks, and take measures
to break up and neutralize mobility networks used by
terrorists so as to respond collectively to the challenges
posed by terrorism.

The Security Council has just adopted resolution
2396 (2017), which contains many important and
positive elements, including respect for the principles
and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations;
respect for the sovereignty, independence and
territorial integrity of States; and not linking terrorism
to any specific religion or ethnicity. The resolution
calls on Member States to step up border controls,
information-sharing, law enforcement and judicial
cooperation. The coordinating role of the United
Nations should be given full play and efforts must
be made to curtail the terrorist organizations' use of
the Internet for propaganda, recruitment and other
terrorist activities.

We voted in favour of the resolution and hope
that it will be effectively implemented. China has
always strongly opposed terrorism in all its forms and
manifestations. As an important member of the counter-
terrorism community, we are ready to work with other
countries and organizations to respond collectively to
the threats and challenges posed by terrorism in order
to maintain international peace and stability.
