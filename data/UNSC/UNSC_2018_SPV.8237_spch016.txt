Mr. Alotaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I would
like to begin by thanking the High Representative for
Disarmament Affairs, Mrs. Izumi Nakamitsu, for her
valuable briefing on the outcome of the report published
by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons (OPCW) on 12 April, concerning the incident
that took place on 4 March in Salisbury, United
Kingdom, with the use of a toxic chemical substance
that led to the poisoning and hospitalization of three
people. I would also like to thank the representative
of the United Kingdom for her detailed briefing on
the latest developments. Allow me to reiterate my best
wishes to the victims of this incident, a father and his
daughter, and to the policemen and civilians affected
by the attack for their quick recovery.

The laboratory analysis of the OPCW confirms
through environmental and biomedical samples the
use during the incident in Salisbury of toxic chemical
substance with a high degree of purity, classified as
neurotoxins. The State of Kuwait reaffirms its firm
position condemning the use of chemical weapons by
any party, in any circumstance and in any place. We
also condemn the production, acquisition, stockpiling
or retention of chemical weapons, as well as their
direct or indirect transfer, in line with article I of the
Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), to which the
State of Kuwait has been party since 1997.

We express our solidarity with the United Kingdom
and support it in all actions and measures to be taken
regarding the investigation of that incident. The State
of Kuwait believes in the importance of abiding by
international law and international norms, and in
upholding the maintenance of international peace and
security, in accordance with the Charter of the United
Nations. We call on all parties concerned to cooperate
with all the ongoing investigations through the OPCW
and in accordance with the provisions of the CWC.
