Mr. Bessho (Japan): I would like to thankthe briefers
for their very comprehensive and insightful briefings.

The media reports on migrants sold into slavery
in Libya were shocking. Refugees and migrants are
especially vulnerable to trafficking, as well as various
forms of exploitation, including forced labour, slavery
or practices similar to slavery, which pose a serious
threat to human dignity and integrity. The international
community must make the utmost efforts to eliminate
such heinous crimes.

We take note of the Libyan Government's
commitment to investigate the inhumane practices
and call on the Government to ensure justice and
accountability through its investigation and prosecution
of those who are responsible. We hope that a thorough
investigation and prosecution will deter similar crimes.

The Security Council has been working to support
the political process in Libya, cooperating with the
Special Representative ofthe Secretary-General as well
as United Nations organs and Member States. The need
to reinforce the Government of Libya and to enhance
its institutions, including its security sector and border
security, is ever more pressing. At the same time, we
need to address the root causes that are forcing people
to leave their homes. That issue requires better regional
coordination and cooperation. The Council needs to
address the trafficking in migrants by working not only
with Libya but also with other Member States in the
region, as well as regional organizations.

We are encouraged by the African Union
communique of 20 November, whereby it was
announced that the Chairperson of the Commission
intends to send an envoy for consultations with the
Libyan Government and other stakeholders to agree on
practical measures to improve the plight of migrants in
Libya. The Council needs to closely follow the situation
and to take appropriate action.
