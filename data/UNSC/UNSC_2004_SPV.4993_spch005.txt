The President: I thank the President of the
Economic and Social Council for her statement and for
welcoming the theme of the role of civil society,
especially in the reconciliation process and in building
national consensus in peace-building, which we also
consider to be a timely subject.

I shall now give the floor to Mr. Denis Caillaux,
Secretary General of CARE International.
