Mr. Musayev (Azerbaijan): Azerbaijan supports
the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in
Darfur (UNAMID) and recognizes its contribution to the
protection of civilians, the improvement of the security
situation and the promotion of peace and the political
process in Darfur. We note that some conclusions
drawn in resolution 2063 (2012) do not coincide with
our assessment of the current situation on the ground
and are not fully reflective of the Secretary-General's
views contained in his recent reports on UNAMID. We
believe that some additional important elements could
have been included in the resolution. We also regret that
discussions on the draft resolution were not sufficiently
open, inclusive and transparent.

For these reasons, Azerbaijan decided to abstain in
the voting on the resolution just adopted.
