Ms. Korjenie: There were no questions directed
at me, but I would like to say that I agree with what
the High Representative just said. I would like to
add, very briefly, that the rule of law is the only way
towards justice and a peaceful future. It is critical that
the country's elected political leaders start defining
an environment of dignity and mutual respect for
everyone, especially for all of the survivors and victims
of genocide and war crimes.
