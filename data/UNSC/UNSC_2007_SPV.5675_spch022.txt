The President: I thank Mr. Schwarz-Schilling for
his poignant remarks. Once again, on behalf of the
members of the Council, I wish him all the best and
thank him for his commitment to the consolidation of
peace and prosperity in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Let me also take this opportunity to thank His
Excellency Mr. Nikola Spirie for his participation in
this meeting.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my

present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
