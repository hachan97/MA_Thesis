Mr. IliicheV (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian delegation abstained in the
voting on resolution 2304 (2016). We agree that an acute
worsening of the situation in South Sudan requires an
appropriate reaction from the Security Council. We
support the initiative of the Intergovernmental Authority
on Development (IGAD) on strengthening security
in South Sudan, including the establishment of the
regional protection force. At the same time, in working
on the United States draft, a whole range of important
issues was not resolved, such as the agreement of the
South Sudanese authorities to the mandate of the force,
its presence outside of the capital, the force's possible
use of force and the sanctions annex, which should have
been treated in the form of a separate draft resolution.

We consider that paragraph 10 of the resolution
will be implemented in close cooperation with Juba.
We consider the consent of the host country to be a
cornerstone, not only from the point of view of respect
for the sovereignty of South Sudan and for the basic
principles of United Nations peacekeeping, but also
from a practical point of View, specifically in terms
of implementing the mandate of the United Nations
Mission in South Sudan, including the work of the
regional protection force. The security of peacekeepers
will depend on such consent. We call on IGAD and the
Secretariat to work constructively with the Government
of South Sudan with a View to finding the modalities
for implementing resolution 2304 (2016).
