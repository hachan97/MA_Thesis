The President (interpretation from Spanish): Out of
consideration for my colleagues, particularly for
Ambassadors and delegations whose countries are not
members of the Security Council, I should like to share
my plan of work.

I propose that we should not go beyond 7 o'clock
this evening and that we should then resume the meeting
at 10 am. tomorrow. In other words, we would plan to
begin - actually begin - at 10.15 or 10.20 and, God
willing, end about noon or perhaps even a little earlier.
Thus we should be spared the need to meet in the
afternoon.

The next speaker is the representative of India. I
invite him to take a place at the Council table and to
make his statement.
