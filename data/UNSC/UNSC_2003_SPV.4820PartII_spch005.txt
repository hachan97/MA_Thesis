Mr. Tafrov (Bulgaria) (spoke in French):
Bulgaria welcomes the adoption of the resolution
permitting the lifting of sanctions imposed against
Libya, a country with which Bulgaria maintains very
close and important relations.

Bulgaria co-sponsored this resolution out of a
concern for equity. We have always maintained that
once a country under sanctions fulfils the conditions
imposed on it by the Council, the sanctions must be
lifted. That was the case with Libya, with reference to
the letter from the Charge d'affaires a.i. at the
Permanent Mission of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to
the United Nations addressed to the President of the
Council (S/2003/818) and the joint letter from you, Mr.
President, as Permanent Representative of the United
Kingdom, and the Permanent Representative of the
United States (S/2003/819) informing the Council that
those conditions had been met.

Bulgaria welcomes the fact that lifting the
sanctions will make it possible for the Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya to be fully integrated into international life.
We believe that this day may mark a new departure in
the relationship between Libya and the international
community as a whole.
