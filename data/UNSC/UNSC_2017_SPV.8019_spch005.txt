Mr. Vitrenko (Ukraine): Ukraine welcomes
today's unanimous adoption of resolution 2371 (2017)
and commends the efforts of the delegations involved
in drafting and bringing the text to a vote, under the
strong leadership of the United States.

North Korea's advancing nuclear- and ballistic-
missile programmes are close to the most significant
proliferation challenge of our time. Ukraine firmly
condemns Pyongyang's continuous illegal activities.
Besides their highly visible manifestation in the form
ofnuclear tests and missile launches, it has also crafted
an intricate system for evading sanctions in order to
circumvent the restrictions and prohibitions already
in place. Today's resolution not only strengthens the
existing measures, it reinforces them with additional
sectoral and targeted sanctions and clarifies some of
the Council's previous measures. It also unambiguously
affirms the Council's openness to a dialogue on a
peaceful and diplomatic solution to the situation on
the Korean peninsula and its determination to avoid
affecting the North Korean population.

Ukraine has always been committed to taking
effective multilateral action against the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction. Our collective decision
today is a clear demonstration of the Council's firm and
united stance in responding decisively to this threat to
the global non-proliferation regime. I would also like to
emphasize the importance of ensuring that all Member
States implement the Council's relevant resolutions
promptly and comprehensively in order to make the
sanctions produce results. We need to act jointly at the
global level if we are to eliminate the risk of further
provocations and curb the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea's rampant nuclear and missile ambitions.
