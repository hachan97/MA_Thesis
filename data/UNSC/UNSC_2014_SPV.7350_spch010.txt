Mr. Barros Melet (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): We
thank Ambassador Gary Quinlan for introducing the
quarterly report of the work of the Security Council
Committee established pursuant to resolution 1737
(2006). We greatly value and acknowledge the role of
Australia as Chair of the Committee for the past two
years. We also want to thank the Panel of Experts and
its coordinator for introducing the midterm report made
to the 1737 Committee on Monday, 8 December.

With respect to the negotiations between the P5+1
and Iran, we appreciate the commitment achieved by
the parties to renew the Joint Plan of Action until the
end of June 2015, which will allow the dialogue to
continue in the search for a comprehensive settlement.

Chile also notes the report of the Director General
of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),
and we call on the IAEA to continue supporting the
Joint Plan of Action through the ongoing monitoring
and verification activities of the voluntary measures
contemplated in the Plan.

We believe that, despite the challenges, it is essential
to maintain the positive atmosphere that has prevailed
in the negotiations. The Council must continue to
make a constructive contribution in this case, with the
understanding that it is in the common interest that an
agreement be achieved to restore international trust.

Lastly, we encourage Iran to improve its cooperation
with the Committee and the Board of Governors of
the IAEA. If we do not achieve a comprehensive
and satisfactory agreement, the measures taken by
the Security Council with regard to Iran's in nuclear
programme will remain in force.
