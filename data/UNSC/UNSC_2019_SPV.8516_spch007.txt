The President: I thank Mr. Apakan for his briefing.

As Mr. Apakan will soon complete his term, on
behalf of the Security Council, I would like to thank
him for all the work he has accomplished. I should
also like to ask him to convey to everyone from the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine the Council's
appreciation for their work.

I now give the floor to Mr. Sajdik.
