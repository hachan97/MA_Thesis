Mr. Pujalte (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): Mexico
joined in the consensus for the adoption of resolution
1518, based on the following understandings: first, in
connection with operative paragraph 2, regarding
adoption of the guidelines and definitions for the
implementation of the provisions of paragraphs 19
through 23 of resolution 1483 (2003), Mexico notes
that on its territory, this will be done in accordance
with Mexican law and with strict compliance with the
principle of legality. Secondly, with regard to operative
paragraph 3 of the resolution, which refers to the
possibility of authorizing an additional provision
concerning observing Member States' fulfilment of
their obligations, under paragraph 10 of resolution
1483 (2003), Mexico notes the following: a general
embargo was established by resolution 661 (1990),
including an arms embargo. Security Council
resolution 1483 (2003) lifted all of the sanctions except
for the arms embargo and, therefore, there is an
obligation on the part of the Council to oversee the
arms embargo in Iraq as is done with other embargoes
by the Security Council, without any distinction
whatsoever.
