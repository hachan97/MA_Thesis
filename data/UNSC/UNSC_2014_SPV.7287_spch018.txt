Mr. Laro (Nigeria): I thank the briefers for their
briefings. Nigeria welcomes the efforts of European
leaders towards resolving the crisis in eastern Ukraine.
The recent meeting between President Putin and
President Poroshenko during the Asia-Europe summit
has opened a promising vista. We see such high-level
engagements as providing a platform for exploring
ways to end the instability and violence that have
engulfed eastern Ukraine. We stress that a diplomatic
solution is the only viable option for resolving the crisis
in Ukraine.

The Minsk agreement is an encouraging
development that provides an avenue for de-escalating
tension in eastern Ukraine. We believe that if fully
implemented, it could restore peace and stability in
the region. We therefore strongly urge all parties to
abide by their commitments under the provisions of the
agreement.

Throughout our engagement on this issue, we have
stressed adherence to the principles embodied in the
Charter of the United Nations, namely, respect for the
sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of
States. In that connection we condemn the plans by
separatist forces to hold local elections in November.
It is contrary to the spirit of the Minsk agreement and
can further threaten the peace, unity and sovereignty of
Ukraine. We appeal to Member States with influence
over the separatists to prevail on them to drop their
plans to hold the elections in the interest of peace and
security in Ukraine.
