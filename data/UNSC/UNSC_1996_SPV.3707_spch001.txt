The President (interpretation from Spanish): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Georgia, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Volski
(Georgia) took a seat at the Council table.

The President (interpretation from Spanish): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General pursuant to Security Council
resolution 1065 (1996), document S/1996/644, and the
report of the Secretary-General concerning the situation in
Abkhazia, Georgia, document 8/1996/843.

Members of the Council also have before them
document 8/1996/866, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by France, Germany, the Russian
Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and the United States of America.

It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(5/1996/866) before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put the
draft resolution to the vote.

 
There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on the representative of China, who
wishes to make a statement before the voting.
