Mr. Dah (Cote d'Ivoire) (spoke in French): I would
like to thank the Acting Under-Secretary-General for
Political Affairs for his briefing on the events happening
in Gaza. Needless to say, we are seriously concerned
about the gravity of the situation that has led to the loss
of lives there. My delegation condemns these acts and
urges the parties involved to avoid any escalation of
the violence. We want to affirm our principled position
on this issue, which is that only through dialogue and
political compromise can we find a peaceful solution to
the conflict in the region. Once again, we will continue
to follow the evolving situation closely and we will
definitely comment on it again in the next few days.
