Belgium voted in favour of resolution 2548 (2020), which renews the mandate of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) for 12 months. Belgium thanks the delegation of the United States of America for its transparent work. Belgium welcomes the work of MINURSO. We have confidence in its neutral reporting role and the stabilizing nature of its presence, which helps ease tensions. We call on the parties to cooperate unreservedly with the Mission. Belgium reiterates its appreciation of the commitment of, and especially for the results achieved by, the former Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General, Mr. Horst Kohler. We hope a capable successor will be appointed as soon as possible to resume the process of dialogue based on the work of President K6hler. Finally, Belgium is concerned at the increase in ceasefire violations and calls for the greatest of restraint. Belgium stresses that the only solution to the question of Western Sahara is an inclusive political one.
