Mr. Wang Yingfan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
We welcome the Prime Minister of Spain, His
Excellency Mr. Jose Maria Aznar, to the Security
Council and thank him for his insightful statement.

Terrorism is a threat to all humankind. We should
combat it resolutely whenever, wherever and for
whatever motive it occurs. Since its inception, the
Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) has played an
important role in assisting countries to implement
resolution 1373 (2001), particularly in the areas of
strengthening counter-terrorism legislation, institution-
building and promoting international cooperation on
counter-terrorism.

A moment ago, the Prime Minister of Spain put
forward some specific proposals. We are ready to
discuss those proposals. We believe that under the
Spanish chairmanship, the CTC will continue to make
progress in its work. The Chinese delegation will
provide the CTC with active and full cooperation.

In recent years, the majority of countries have
stressed these prominent issues with respect to
practices for combating terrorism: strengthening
international cooperation on counter-terrorism,
eradicating the sources of terrorism, actively promoting
solutions for regional hot spots, promoting and
deepening the dialogue among civilizations and
curbing the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction. Enhancing international consensus on
those issues and gradually adopting effective and
practical measures in that regard are the keys to further
reinforcing, and making additional gains in, the
international campaign against terrorism. The United
Nations should meet that challenge by playing a pivotal
role in the international fight against terrorism.
