Mrs. Kawar (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): Jordan
voted in favour of resolution 2240 (2015) because
it reflects our position. We believe that it is very
important to help the Libyan Government to fight
organized crime and to protect vulnerable people and
refugees in view of the dangers caused by trafficking
in the Mediterranean. That phenomenon has already
caused thousands of deaths. However, Jordan would
like to emphasize several points.

First, thie resolution must not be misunderstood or
misinterpreted by States and parties as an authorization
to bypass the provisions of refugee conventions or
override the legal principles that govern the use of
force. Secondly, the seventh preambular paragraph of
the resolution should not be narrowly interpreted, in
particular when it comes to the definition of a refugee.
The protection of and respect for international refugee
law must be an integral part of this resolution, since
refugees represent a large number of those who are the
object of trafficking in the Mediterranean, from Syria
and other countries. I speak here from the perspective
of a State that knows this situation first-hand. Jordan,
despite its limited resources, has welcomed many
refugees, who now represent 20 per cent of our

population.

The resolution must not function as a shield for any
State or party that attempts to violate the provisions of
international law. We must assume responsibility for
any violations. In that regard, I would like to recall that
the use of force in accordance with operative paragraph
10 of the resolution must be limited in scope, because
the use of force against non-State players or individual
non-State actors in the context of human trafficking in
the Mediterranean does not violate the legal norms that
allow parties to resort to force. Here I refer to the ins ad
helium approach.
