The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Ms. Landgren for her comprehensive briefing on the
situation in Burundi and on the development and
prospects ofthepeacebuilding process. As she indicated,
this is her last briefing as Special Representative of
the Secretary-General in Burundi. On behalf of the
Council, I wish to thank her for her effectiveness,
dedication and the seriousness with which she always
presented her reports and kept the Council updated on
the situation in that country, which all of us hope will
continue to make progress.

I now give the floor to Mr. Seger.
