Mr. De La Sabliere (France) (spoke in French):
France has just voted for the draft resolution that has
been adopted as resolution 1510 (2003).

Afghanistan is now at a critical juncture for its
future. We commend the determination of the
international community to support the Afghan people
and authorities to assist them to meet the immense
challenge of reconstruction and peace.

For its part, France is already greatly involved in
Afghanistan, and intends to remain so. With respect to
security, French forces are taking part in the
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and in
the operations against terrorist networks in the
framework of Operation Enduring Freedom. Moreover,
the French army is helping, side by side with United
States forces, in the training of a new Afghan army.

Nevertheless, France considers that the extension
of the ISAF mandate that the Security Council has just
decided on does not entail a commitment of its forces
outside Kabul. France does not plan to involve itself in
missions beyond those that it is currently fulfilling.

The resolution authorizes ISAF to protect
international civil personnel involved, in particular, in
reconstruction efforts and humanitarian assistance. We
understand that the protection provided by ISAF relates
above all to the civilian personnel of the provincial
reconstruction teams (PRT).

It is essential today that the international
community give its full support to the Afghan
authorities to enable them to exercise effective power
over the entire Afghan territory. This is the full
meaning of the Bonn Agreement, in both the letter and
the spirit. The international community must spare no
effort to help Afghanistan to take its fate into its own
hands once again. France will continue, with many
other nations, to do its part.
