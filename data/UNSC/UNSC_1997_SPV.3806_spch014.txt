Mr. Wang Xuexian (China) (interpretation from Chinese): China attaches great importance to the peace
process in Haiti and has all along supported the positive
efforts made by the United Nations and the international
community in this regard. We welcome the progress made
by Haiti in political, economic and social fields in recent
years with the help of the international community. We
also appreciate the efforts and the contributions made by
the countries concerned. We sincerely hope that Haiti will

 

enjoy long-term stability and that its people will live and
work in peace and contentment.

China holds that the situation in Haiti no longer poses
a threat to international peace and security and that the
United Nations peacekeeping mission in Haiti has already
been completed. The main task now facing Haiti is
economic reconstruction and development, which should
mainly be the responsibility of the Haitian people
themselves. In this connection, the international community,
particularly international financial institutions and other
United Nations agencies, should play an active role.

At the same time, considering the urgent request of the
Haitian Government and the wishes of Latin American and
Caribbean countries, the Chinese Government supports the
establishment of the United Nations Transition Mission in
Haiti as a transitional measure. We hope that it will work
together with Haiti's National Police Force and the new
Government to promote security and development in Haiti.

In View of the fact that the draft resolution before us
has accommodated the request of the Haitian Government
and taken into proper consideration the concerns of the
interested parties, the Chinese delegation will vote in favour
of it.
