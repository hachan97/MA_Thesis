Ms. McAskie: Certainly I support what my
colleague has just said, and would also add that it is
terribly important for us to keep a very close eye on the
humanitarian and political situation in the surrounding
countries, not only because of the impact on those
countries themselves, but also because of the need to
address these issues in terms of maintaining the
stability of the peace process in Sierra Leone. It would
be unfortunate if events in those countries were to
derail the gains that have been made so far.
