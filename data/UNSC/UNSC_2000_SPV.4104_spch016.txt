The President (spoke in Spanish): It is my
understanding that the Security Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution (S/2000/143)
before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, China, France,
Jamaica, Malaysia, Mali, Namibia, Netherlands,
Russian Federation, Tunisia, Ukraine, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America

 

The President (spoke in Spanish): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1291 (2000).

I shall now call on those members of the Council who
wish to make statements following the voting.
