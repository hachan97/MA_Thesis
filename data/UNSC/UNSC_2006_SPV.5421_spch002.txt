Mr. De La Sabliere (France) (spoke in French):
France welcomes the adoption of resolution 1671
(2006), which attests to the commitment of the
international community, particularly the United
Nations and the European Union, to the peace process
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The force
whose deployment the Council has just authorized will
be an important element in ensuring that the elections
scheduled for June go smoothly.

Here, I should like to recall our interpretation of
operative paragraph 4 of the resolution which, as I
understand from our consultations on the text, is shared
by other Council members: it will not be necessary to
adopt another resolution to renew the European force's
mandate when the Council decides, by 30 September,
to extend the mandate of the United Nations
Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (MONUC). Its intention to do that is stated
in the resolution's eleventh preambular paragraph.
