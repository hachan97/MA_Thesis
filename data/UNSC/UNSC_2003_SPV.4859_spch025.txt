The President: I thank Mr. Piot for the
clarification he has provided. As there are no further
speakers inscribed on my list, the Security Council has
thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of
the item on its agenda. Before adjourning the meeting,
I would like to inform Council members that a
document summarizing the key points of the debate
will be compiled and made public.

The meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.
