Mr. Qin Huasun (China) (interpretation from Chinese): We have taken note or the statements made by
several representatives. We believe that deciding one's own
position on the merits of a matter is the right or every
sovereign State.

Some countries made accusations against. China. Those
accusations are totally groundless.
