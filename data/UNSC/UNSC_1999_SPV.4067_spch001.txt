The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received letters from the representatives of
Burundi, Finland, Norway and the United Republic of
Tanzania in which they request to be invited to participate
in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives to
participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Nteturuye
(Burundi) took a seat at the Council table; Ms. Rasi
(Finland), Mr. Kolby (Norway) and Mr. Manongi
(United Republic of Tanzania) took the seats reserved
for them at the side of the Council Chamber.

The President: In accordance with the understanding
reached in the Council's prior consultations, and in the
absence of objection, I shall take it that the Security
Council agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Ibrahima Fall,
Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

I give the floor to the Assistant Secretary-General for
Political Affairs, Mr. Ibrahima Fall.
