The President (spoke in Arabic): Before I give
the floor to the next representative, I realize that this
may be the final statement that Ambassador Delattre
delivers to the Council before he leaves us in a couple
of days. I speak on behalf of all Council members when
I say that he should be proud of what he has achieved in
an outstanding professional manner. We congratulate
him on his new post and wish him every success in his
future endeavours.
