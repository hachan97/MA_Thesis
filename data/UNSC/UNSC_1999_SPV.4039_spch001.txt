Afghanistan, Egypt, Finland, India, the Islamic Republic of
Iran, Japan, Kazakhstan, Norway, Pakistan, Tajikistan,
Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in which they request
to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice,
I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules

The President: In accordance with the understanding
reached in the Council's prior consultations, and in the
absence of objection, I shall take it that the Security
Council agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Kieran Prendergast,

accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

I invite the Under-Secretary-General for Political
Affairs, Mr. Kieran Prendergast, to take a seat at the
Council table and to make his statement.
