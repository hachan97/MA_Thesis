Mr. Allen (United Kingdom): The United Kingdom, together with Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany and the United States of America, would like to raise an objection to the briefer proposed under rule 39 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure. The purpose of our meeting today is for the Security Council to review the implementation of resolution 2118 (2013) and the decision of 27 September 2013 by the Executive Council of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Our discussion should focus on those issues. While we agree that the presidency of the Security Council should have the space to propose briefers, they must be relevant to and knowledgeable of the topic under discussion. Unfortunately, that is not the case for one of today's briefers. Mr. Bustani is a distinguished diplomat, but given his departure from the OPCW many years before it considered the Syria chemical weapons file, he is not in a position to provide relevant knowledge or information on the implementation of resolution 2118 (2013), unlike, for example, the current Director General of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.We would therefore request that the presidency put the issue of its proposed briefer to a procedural vote.
