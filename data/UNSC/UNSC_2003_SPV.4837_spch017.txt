Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
At the outset, I wish to thank President Meron and
Lord Ashdown for their detailed briefings. I commend
Lord Ashdown for his efforts to facilitate the
implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement.

The Chinese delegation has been closely
following the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We
were pleased to see that, as a result of the unremitting
efforts of the Government and the people of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, the country is moving towards stability.
We note the preliminary results of reconstruction and
the further harmonization of various ethnic groups. We
hope that the parties concerned in Bosnia and
Herzegovina will pursue their efforts to consolidate the
peace process in a joint commitment to the lasting
peace and development of the country. This is in the
interests not only of the members of Bosnia's various
groups, but also of the peace and stability of the region
as a whole.

China has always supported the peace process in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. We have contributed civilian
and police personnel to the United Nations Mission in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. China is willing to join the
rest of the international community in pursuing efforts
to help that country to embark on the path of
autonomous development as soon as possible.

My delegation supports the various efforts
undertaken by the International Criminal Tribunal for
the Former Yugoslavia to further improve the
efficiency of its proceedings. We are particularly
grateful to President Meron for his work to that end.
We note that the State Court, the Prosecutor's Office
and the Special Department of Bosnia and Herzegovina
are preparing to establish a special chamber to try war
crimes. We hope that the establishment of the relevant
organs will further the implementation of the
Tribunal's completion strategy and promote the
achievement of justice and national reconciliation.
