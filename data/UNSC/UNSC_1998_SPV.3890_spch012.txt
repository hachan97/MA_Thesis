Mr. Dangue-Rewaka (Gabon) (interpretation from French): Once again, we are facing the threat of a nuclear
arms race. In similar circumstances, the ideal would be for
the Security Council to adopt a consistent attitude of
firmness and disapproval, regardless of who stands accused.
We are obliged to note, however, that in fact, in certain
cases, the Council's assessments are subject to equivocation
and some subjectivism.

That is why we would have preferred, inter alia, that
operative paragraph 1 of the draft resolution under
consideration be worded in the same terms as the
statements adopted by the Council in similar circumstances.

Having said that, in our desire for unity and a
constructive spirit, we will associate ourselves with the
consensus.
