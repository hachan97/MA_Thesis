Mr. King (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom associates itself with the European Union
statement to be given shortly by the Italian
Ambassador. We welcome this opportunity to reiterate
our support for Council resolution 1244 (1999) as the
basis for the international community's policy on
Kosovo.

Kosovo has come a long way since that resolution
was passed in 1999. For the work that he has done in
the past 18 months, Mr. Steiner deserves much credit
and our thanks for putting down the strong foundations
necessary to build a successful future for Kosovo. We
have heard about the developments and achievements
this morning. But in particular we would like to draw
attention to Mr. Steiner's policy initiative of "standards
before status", which has underpinned the international
community's recent efforts. The United Kingdom
firmly supports that policy and continues to believe
that making the benchmarks operational is an important
task that needs to be taken forward.

There is still work to do, as we have heard. The
task ahead for the international community is to ensure
that Kosovo's citizens and the authorities in both
Pristina and Belgrade work together to build a future
that really works - a future that reflects the
democratic principles of tolerance and security for all.
The international community will do all it can in
support, but the onus is also on those in the region to
show the seriousness of their efforts to achieve those
goals. In that respect, the United Kingdom particularly
welcomes the open letter, quoted earlier by Mr. Steiner,
to displaced residents of Kosovo, calling on those who
have not yet returned to do so and to join the effort to
make Kosovo safer and better for all. This, after all, is
the goal that we all share.
