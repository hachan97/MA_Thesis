Mr. Yao Shaojun (China) (spoke in Chinese):
The situation in Abyei remains generally calm. It has
benefited not only from the assistance provided by the

European Union and the international community but
also, more importantly, from good cooperation between
the Sudan and South Sudan on the relevant issues.
Whether the Abyei issue can be properly resolved
has a bearing on the stability of the two countries
concerned and the region as a whole. The continued
active implementation by the United Nations Interim
Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) of its mandate will
contribute to the maintenance of peace and stability in
the region, which is why China voted in favour of the
Council's adoption just now of resolution 2469 (2019).
The Security Council and the international community
should continue to provide constructive support to the
two Governments in order to properly address the Abyei
issue, support African countries in resolving African
problems in African ways and refrain from imposing
solutions. In particular, as the implementation of the
resolution advances, we must focus on strengthening
engagement with various stakeholders in the Sudan and
South Sudan through communication and coordination,
listening to their legitimate concerns and encouraging
them to continue to strengthen dialogue and build
mutual trust. China will continue to support UNISFA
in fulfilling its mandate, and we stand ready to play a
constructive role in achieving peace and stability in the
area as soon as possible.
