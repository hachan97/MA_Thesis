Mr. Enio Cordeiro (Brazil): The Brazilian
Government is attentively following the situation in
Kosovo and expresses its concern about the most recent
developments in the crisis, including the humanitarian
aspects. In conformity with its unflinching commitment to
the pacific settlement of disputes, the Brazilian
Government regrets that the escalation of tensions has
resulted in recourse to military action.
