Mr. Sevi (Turkey): Turkey aligns itself with the
statement made by the representative of the European
Union.

I would like to take this opportunity to make
some very brief additional remarks on the sanctions
regime under the Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1267 (1999). Turkey believes that the
overall review process is important and should be
undertaken in an effective manner. The Ombudsperson
will contribute to the effectiveness of the process and
to the rule of law, including by preventing possible
unfair application of the listing process. Therefore, we
fully support the Ombudsperson.

On the other hand, all counter-terrorism measures
should respect the basic human rights of individuals. In
this regard, the right to reply and object of those
persons who have been added to the consolidated list
should be protected.
