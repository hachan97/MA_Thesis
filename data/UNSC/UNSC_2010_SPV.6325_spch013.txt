Mr. Mugoya (Uganda): We welcome and thank
the Foreign Minister of Turkey for his informative
statement. We also welcome the presence of the
Deputy Secretary-General and thank Assistant
Secretary-General Fernandez-Taranco for his briefing.

It was with shock that we received the reports of
the Israeli attack on the humanitarian flotilla travelling
to Gaza in international waters this morning. Uganda
condemns the attack on the humanitarian convoy,
which resulted to loss of life and injuries, and we
express our condolences to the bereaved families.
While we do not have the full facts and will await full
details, we do support the call by the Secretary-General
for a full investigation into this matter.

We are concerned by the grave humanitarian
situation caused by the continued blockade imposed
against the people of Gaza. This incident serves only to
exacerbate the political stalemate arising from a lack of
substantive progress in the Middle East peace process.
It is also a reminder, and we reiterate our call on Israel
to end the blockade of Gaza and to allow delivery of
humanitarian aid to its population. We call on Israel to
release the ships and civilians they hold and to permit
the delivery of humanitarian assistance to its final
destination.

Finally, we re-emphasize the importance of the
full implementation of Security Council resolution
1860 (2009).
