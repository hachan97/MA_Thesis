Mr. Yankey (Ghana): I thank Under-Secretary-
General Egeland for his update. I wish to commend
him on his tireless efforts to ensure that the plight of
the millions of displaced people in Darfur continues to
receive the attention it deserves. We further welcome
his positive assessment of the negotiations between the
Lord's Resistance Army and the Government of
Uganda and his recommendations in that regard. We
share the view that without justice there can be no
lasting peace and stress the need to uphold the
independence of the International Criminal Court.

The Emergency Relief Coordinator has been very
clear about the urgency with which the impediments to
the delivery of humanitarian assistance must be
addressed, even as the consultations on implementing
the Darfur Peace Agreement and the related
deployment of a peacekeeping mission in Darfur
continue. The tragic irony about the situation in Darfur
is that the flow of arms and those engaging in war
crimes and crimes against humanity enjoy more
freedom than do those engaged in saving lives. It is for
the Council to draw its own conclusions about the
motives and intentions behind the deliberate imposition
of restrictions on humanitarian relief.

Mr. Egeland, who is very familiar with the daily
reality in the IDP camps, has strongly emphasized that
the time available to avert a looming disaster in Darfur
is very limited. We must decide on the appropriate
response. I have a question that is just a matter of
detail. We are interested to know from the Emergency
Relief Coordinator whether there are any up-to-date
records on the number of deaths that have occurred in
the IDP camps. In most reports one still sees the figure
of 200,000, or sometimes 300,000. Are there any up-to-
date records on the number of deaths?
