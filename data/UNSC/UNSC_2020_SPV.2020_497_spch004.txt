Indonesia welcomes today's adoption of resolution 2525 (2020), on the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID). We commend both penholders' efforts in facilitating the negotiations and their commitment to championing consensus amid the challenging circumstances resulting from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Indonesia believes that a responsible drawdown of UNAMID is closely linked to the Sudan's overall journey towards peace and stability. With this in mind, Indonesia voted in favour of the resolution. As UNAMID's drawdown has coincided with an unprecedented global pandemic, we need to adjust the drawdown plan to ensure that its execution is smooth and responsible. We welcome the new deadline and look forward to hearing the Secretary-General's assessment on progress in the drawdown. In the meantime, UNAMID needs to continue to play its protection-of- civilian role in Darfur and support the Government of the Sudan in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. These efforts should be undertaken while ensuring the safety, security and health of all peacekeepers and workers serving under UNAMID. Finally, Indonesia hopes that, with resolution 2525 (2020), the responsible drawdown of UNAMID will smoothen the Sudan's transition into a new chapter in its journey towards peace and prosperity.
