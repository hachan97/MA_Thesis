Mr. Heusgen (Germany): To be brief, I can only
echo what was said earlier by my Belgium and United
Kingdom colleagues. This is a very sad day for the
Syrian people and the Security Council. China and
Russia bear an enormous responsibility. We are going
into the holiday season now, and 4 million people in
Syria do not know if in the next year, after 10 January
2020, they will still receive food, be able to feed their
babies or get medicine.

We went very far and received a lot of criticism.
There were questions as to why we did not put five
or four and why were we ready to do six plus six,
and so on. We were criticized a lot by many around
the table, but we were ready to compromise. We tried
to get everybody on board. My Russian colleague put
something on the table and said, "take it or leave it". Is
that Russian diplomacy - not being ready to negotiate,
not giving anything andjust saying "do it or not"? With
respect to his remark that it is not 4 million but only
1 million people who are suffering - what kind of
cynicism is that?

My Chinese colleague said very clearly that
China supports the Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). OCHA asked for this.
It asked for more than what we offered. How can he be
against that? I again ask the representatives of Russia
and China to not let the people down. We are ready to
work hard to see to it that after 10 January 2020 there
will still be a possibility for those suffering people
to survive.
