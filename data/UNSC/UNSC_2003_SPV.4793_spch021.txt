Mr. Rosenblatt (United States of America): We
would like to join other members in welcoming Prime
Minister Diarra to the Security Council today, and take
this opportunity to express the support of the United
States for his efforts in moving the reconciliation
process forward in Cote d'Ivoire. We listened with
interest to his presentation of the disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme,
an integral part of that process.

The United States fully supports the
implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis accords and
the Prime Minister's efforts in that regard, and urges
that he continue to look for ways to accelerate the
implementation process. The latter would include the
prompt appointment of permanent defence and interior
ministers.

We applaud the efforts of the armed forces of
Cote d'Ivoire, working in conjunction with the military
stabilization force of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) in C6te d'Ivoire and
the French military unit in carrying out Operation
Licorne, an effort to seal the C6te d'Ivoire-Liberia
border. That operation has helped to hinder further
munitions and arms from reaching the combatants in
the deplorable civil strife in Liberia.

Lastly, we should like to thank the Prime Minister
for his Government's cooperation with the United
Nations military liaison presence in Cote d'Ivoire and
for welcoming the Security Council's mission to
Abidjan. We also can support the draft presidential
statement submitted by France.
