The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now make
a statement in my capacity as representative of the
Argentine Republic.

I would like first of all to thank Mr. Carl Bildt for the
views he has shared with us and his very precise and
detailed report, which are very valuable because of his
experience in the Balkans.

We believe that a long-term strategy designed to bring
about peace and stability in the Balkans depends on a
whole set of factors ranging from the implementation of
political, social and economic reforms to reconciliation
among the countries of the region, as well as reconciliation
among the people within countries. There is therefore an
internal as well as an international dimension, and
sometimes there is also a historical background that dates
back centuries. As Mr. Bildt reminded us, the first decade
of the twentieth century, like the last, was a time of great
convulsions in the Balkans, and that was where the incident
that set off the First World War took place. The agents of
disintegration in the region can be overcome only when all
the participants - the population and the leadership -
realize the need for coexistence in a framework of
pluralism. This is the basis for a democratic society based
on rule of law, without which we have only a society
dominated by fear, violence and intolerance.

In this context, it seems particularly important to us
that we respond appropriately to the plight of refugees and
internally displaced persons. This is necessarily a long-term
process, and the assistance of the international community,
particularly from this Organization, will be required to
prevent further confrontations and to create the necessary
conditions for the establishment of international peace and
security in that region.

I now resume my functions as President.

I call on Mr. Bildt so that he may respond to the
questions and comments that have been addressed to him.
