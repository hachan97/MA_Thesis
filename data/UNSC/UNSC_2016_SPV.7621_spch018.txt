The President (spoke in Spanish): I wish to remind
all speakers to limit their statements to no more than
four minutes in order to enable the Council to carry
out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy
statements are kindly requested to circulate their texts
in writing and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking in the Chamber.

Iwould also like to appeal to speakers to deliver their
statements at a reasonable speed so that interpretation
may be provided accurately.

I wish to inform all concerned that we will be
carrying on this open debate right through the lunch
hour, as we have a very large number of speakers.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Argentina.
