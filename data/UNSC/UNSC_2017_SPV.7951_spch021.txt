The President (spoke in Spanish): I wish to remind
all speakers to restrict their statements to no more than
four minutes in order to allow the Council to carry
out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy
statements are kindly requested to circulate the texts
in writing and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking in the Chamber.

I now give the floor to the representative of the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
