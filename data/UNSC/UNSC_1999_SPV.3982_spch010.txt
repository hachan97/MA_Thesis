Mr. Qin Huasun (China) (interpretation from Chinese): The Chinese delegation voted against the draft
resolution a short while ago. We have always maintained
that United Nations peacekeeping operations, including
preventive deployment missions, should not be
open-ended. The situation in the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia has apparently stabilized in the
past few years, its relations with neighbouring countries
have been improved, and peace and stability there have
not been adversely affected by developments in that
region. In his recent reports, including document
S/ 1999/ 161 before us, the Secretary-General has clearly
indicated that the original goal of the Security Council in
establishing the preventive mission in the former

 

Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has already been met. In
this case, there is no need to extend further the mandate of
the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force
(UNPREDEP).

I should also like to reiterate that Africa and other
regions are still plagued by conflict and instability and need
greater attention and contributions from the United Nations.
In View of the Organization's current financial difficulties,
it would be neither reasonable nor fair to continue to assess
Member States for UNPREDEP. The already insufficient
resources of the United Nations should be used where they
are needed most.

UNPREDEP has contributed to the maintenance of a
stable situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia. China highly appreciates the contributions of
the Secretary-General and others, including countries that
have contributed troops to UNPREDEP.
