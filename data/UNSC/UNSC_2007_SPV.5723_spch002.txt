Mr. De La Sabliere (France) (spoke in French): I
would like to thank you, Mr. President, for your kind
and friendly words addressed to me on the occasion of
my last appearance in the Chamber. I am very touched.
With your permission, I should like to say a few words
to the Council.
First of all, it has been an honour for me to
represent France at the Security Council for almost five
years in order to defend its positions and put forth its
initiatives for world peace and security. It has been a
rewarding task.

I think that we who meet in this body know well
that we live in an unstable world in which old and new
threats to peace and security can build up in a
dangerous way. Crises, internal and regional conflicts,
the protection of civilians and children, terrorism and
the risks posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction call for active international cooperation, a
strong United Nations and a Security Council able to
live up to the responsibilities entrusted to it by the
Charter.

The Council's work is difficult and - perhaps
not always, but often - is successful in both the short
and long term. I would also add that the Council,
acting on behalf of the international community, is
never as strong as when it is united. That is why France
endeavours to promote consensus on, or broad support
for, a good text as much possible.

A spirit of cooperation in the Security Council,
which I have always enjoyed, is crucial, and I would
like to thank colleagues and their missions for it. I
thank them for the quality of our personal relations and
friendships.

In conclusion, I would also like to thank the
Council's secretariat, which supports us in our work,
including translators, and the interpreters - who I
hope have not suffered too much throughout the years
due to the cadence of my speech.
