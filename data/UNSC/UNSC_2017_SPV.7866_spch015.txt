Mr. Aboulatta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Egypt
voted in favour of the Security Council's adoption today
of resolution 2337 (2017), on the developments in The
Gambia, because we hope that it will eventually help to
achieve a breakthrough in the current political impasse
there. We believe in the importance of the Council's
aim, which is to promote and support the brave and
principled positions of the regional Powers concerned,
represented by the African Union and the Economic
Community of West African States, and which also
coincide with our deep-rooted belief in the necessity of
finding African solutions to African crises.

Egypt joined the unanimous consensus on
the resolution after the introduction of important
improvements into the text, and in that regard I would
like to thank the delegation of Senegal for its flexibility.
We were anxious to see the inclusion in the resolution of
wording reflecting one of the most important purposes
and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,
which is the peaceful settlement of disputes. We believe
that efforts to achieve that should be exhaustive if we are
to avoid chaos and uphold the principles of international
law. However, in the light of the last amendment to the
draft, which underlined the importance of a political
settlement of the impasse in The Gambia, we are
convinced that today's resolution does not endorse any
mandatory automatic enforcement, as such processes
require the Security Council's clear and unquestioned
authorization, in accordance with Chapter VIII of the
Charter of the United Nations.

In conclusion, Egypt hopes that the political crisis
in The Gambia can be brought to an end through the
assumption of office of the democratically chosen
President-elect, Mr. Adama Barrow, because we badly
need a shining example of a peaceful democratic
transition of power on our continent that can ultimately
enable it to create a bright future for its peoples.
