The President (spoke in French): Following
consultations among members of the Security Council,
I have been authorized to make the following statement
on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council strongly welcomes
the agreement of 5 May 2006 reached at the intra-
Sudanese peace talks in Abuja as a basis for
lasting peace in Darfur; commends the signatories
to the agreement; expresses its appreciation of the
efforts of President Sassou Nguesso of the
Republic of Congo, President Obasanjo of
Nigeria, in his capacity as host of the talks, and
African Union Special Envoy and Chief
Negotiator Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim; calls on all
the parties to respect their commitments and
implement the agreement without delay; urges
those movements that have not signed the
agreement to do so without delay, noting the
benefits it will bring them and the people of
Darfur, and not to act in any way that would
impede implementation of the agreement; and
welcomes the forthcoming meeting of the African
Union Peace and Security Council on 15 May
2006.

"The Security Council commends the
African Union for what the African Mission in
Sudan (AMIS) has achieved in Darfur despite
difficult circumstances; stresses the need for
AMIS to be urgently further strengthened in line
with the conclusions of the Joint Assessment
Mission report of 10-20 December 2005 so that it
is able to support implementation of the Darfur
peace agreement until a United Nations operation
is deployed; calls in this regard for the Secretary-
General and the African Union to convene a
pledging conference without delay; and urges
Member States and international and regional
organizations to provide every possible assistance
to AMIS.

"The Security Council stresses that the
Secretary-General should consult jointly with the
African Union, in close and continuing
consultation with the Security Council, and in
cooperation and close consultation with the
parties to the Abuja peace talks, including the
Government of National Unity, on decisions
concerning the transition to a United Nations
operation; looks forward to receiving at the
earliest opportunity from the Secretary-General
detailed planning proposals for a United Nations
operation in Darfur; calls in this regard for the
Government of National Unity to facilitate
immediately the visit of a joint United Nations
and African Union technical assessment mission
to Darfur; encourages the Secretary-General to
consult urgently with potential troop-contributing
counties on the assets required for a United
Nations operation; stresses that a United Nations
operation should have strong African
participation and character; and calls on
international and regional organizations and
Member States to provide the United Nations
operation every possible assistance.

"The Security Council expresses its deep
concern over the deteriorating humanitarian
situation in Darfur; welcomes the visit of the
United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator,
Jan Egeland; expresses its deep concern at the
shortfall in humanitarian funding; urges Member
States to make additional funds available; and
calls on all the Sudanese parties to respect the
neutrality, impartiality and independence of
humanitarian assistance agents."

This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2006/21.

There are no further speakers on my list.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 4.10 p.m.
