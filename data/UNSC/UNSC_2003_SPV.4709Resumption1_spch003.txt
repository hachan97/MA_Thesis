The President: Let me repeat what I said
yesterday. I would suggest that all speakers take their
seven minutes fully to address the subject matter. I will
say right now that I am grateful for all the kind words
to me that they may have thought of, so perhaps we can
refrain from addressing kind words to the presidency
and save some time for the discussion of the subject
matter.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Egypt, on whom I now call.
