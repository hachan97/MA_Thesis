Mr. Alajmi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): We welcome
the unanimous adoption by the Security Council of
resolution 2491 (2019). We thank the delegation of
the United Kingdom for its considerable efforts as
penholder on the issue of Libya. At the same time, we
commend its flexibility during the negotiations on the
draft resolution.

Today, we voted in favour of resolution 2491
(2019), thereby confirming our steadfast position in
support of all efforts of the United Nations to address
the challenges raised by the smuggling of migrants and
human trafficking in the Mediterranean off the coast
of Libya.

According to the report of the Secretary-General
contained in document S/2019/711, on implementing
resolution 2437 (2018), there was an increase in the
number of migrant deaths at sea this year as compared
to previous years. Migrants continue to face difficult
and coercive conditions, in particular because of the
security situation in Libya. The continued trafficking
of illegal migrants across Libyan territory and off the
coast of Libya undermines efforts to achieve peace
and stability in that country. We call on all Member
States to support the efforts of the United Nations to
provide a safe haven for migrants and allow them the
time they need to prepare asylum requests or for their
repatriation. That would help to ensure the security,
stability, and territorial integrity of Libya as well as
non-interference in its internal affairs.
