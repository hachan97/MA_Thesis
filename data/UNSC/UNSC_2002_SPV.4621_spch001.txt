The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2002/1106, which contains the text of a
letter dated 26 September 2002 from the Secretary-
General addressed to the President of the Security
Council regarding the nominations which have been
received for permanent judges of the International
Tribunal for Rwanda. In this connection, the members
of the Council will note the information contained in
the Secretary-General's letter.

Members of the Council also have before them
the draft letter which I, as President of the Security
Council, would propose to send to the Secretary-
General in reply to the aforementioned letter, informing
him of the decision by the Council to extend the
deadline for nominations of judges of the Tribunal until
15 November 2002.

In the absence of objection, I shall assume that
the Security Council agrees that I should send the letter
as drafted to the Secretary-General.

It is so decided.

The reply will be issued as a document of the
Council under the symbol S/2002/1 131.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The Council will remain seized of the matter.

The meeting rose at 10.20 am.
