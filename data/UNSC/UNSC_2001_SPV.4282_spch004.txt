Mr. Mudenge (Zimbabwe): The positions as
agreed by the members and declared by the parties are
those positions that were declared, recorded and signed
for on 8 April 2000 at Kampala. They are the positions
that are found also in the Harare sub-plans. As far as
the parties are concerned, there is no confusion as to
which positions are intended, because they were
initialled and signed for by every member. They are in
documentary form, which I am sure the United Nations
has had the advantage of possessing. So the positions
are in no doubt.
