Mr. Wang Yingfan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
The Chinese delegation wishes to thank Mr. Kouchner
for his briefing.

While many people are praising the municipal
elections in Kosovo, we have taken note of the fact that
the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
deems the election result null and void. The Serbs,
Turks and other ethnic groups do not have effective
participation in the elections. Members of ethnic
groups still lack guarantees for their security, and they
are concerned over this situation.

We expect the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to
implement as soon as possible measures to ensure the
representation ofthe Serbs and other ethnic groups. We
have also taken note of the fact that the elections are
regarded locally as a symbol of Kosovo's movement
towards independence. If the tendency towards
Kosovo's independence grows, that would be in
contravention of Security Council resolution 1244
(1999). The international community and the Security
Council should pay attention to this tendency towards
independence in Kosovo and to what consequences it
would have on the situation in the Balkans.

Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) already
contains provisions on the future status of Kosovo. We
hope that UNMIK will actively encourage and guide
the Albanian Kosovars to conduct dialogue with the
Government ofthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. We
believe that the positive and constructive influence of
the international community should be able to produce
positive results. The question of Kosovo can have the
prospect for a fair and reasonable fundamental
resolution only with the ultimate restoration of national
harmony.
