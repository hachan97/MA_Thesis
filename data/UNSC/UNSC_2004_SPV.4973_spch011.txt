Mr. Rostov (United States of America): I want to
thank High Commissioner Lubbers for his briefing, and
I would like to say a few words prior to asking a few
questions.

Members may have seen Secretary of State
Powell announce, on Tuesday of this week, that the
United States was going to contribute an additional
$88.3 million, to bring our total contribution to $247
million for refugee support - $44 million of which is
targeted for Africa.

I also would like to make the point that I think
that we are all not only grateful for the work of the
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), but also cognizant that it probably
has a larger and more important impact on more people
than almost any other Office of the United Nations.

The second point I want to make is that we are
all, I think, very concerned about the humanitarian
situation in and around Darfur and Chad. We are very
conscious, as the Government of the Sudan itself is,
that there is a very dire situation there. My questions
therefore build on the questions colleagues have put
forward and are directed to that situation.

We would be interested in obtaining some insight
into UNHCR's planned protection role for Darfur. We
would be interested in any information about any
contingency planning being done by the Office in the
event of additional refugee flows into Chad. Finally,
following up on a number of questions, we would be
interested in what Mr. Lubbers' Office would
recommend that the international community provide by
way of security to enable refugees to live in a measure
of security and for his Office and other humanitarian
workers to do that work in a secure fashion.
