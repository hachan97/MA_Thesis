Mr. Salam (Lebanon): Allow me, first, to extend
the thanks of the Government of Lebanon to all
members of the Security Council for the unanimous
decision to renew for another year the mandate of the
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL),
without amendment to its mission, its rules of
engagement or its concept of operations, as per the
request of my Government.

I would also like to take this opportunity to praise
UNIFIL's dedicated work, in close coordination and
cooperation with the Lebanese Armed Forces; to
commend the leadership of its Commander, Major
General Asarta Cuevas; and to express our deep
gratitude to all troop-contributing countries for their
continued support to Lebanon and its efforts to
consolidate security and stability in its south. Lebanon
appreciates the troops' valiant sacrifices, the most
recent of which being the regrettable death of a French
UNIFIL member in a car accident last week. Allow me
also to acknowledge the guidance provided by the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations.

I know that this is well known to all members of
the Security Council, however allow me to conclude by
reiterating Lebanon's strong commitment to the full
implementation of resolution 1701 (2006) in its
entirety.
