The President: I thank Mr. Cekuolis for his
statement.

(spoke in French)
In accordance with the understanding reached
among members of the Council, I should like to remind
all speakers to kindly limit the length of their
statements to no more than four minutes, in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work as
expeditiously as possible. Delegations with lengthy
statements are kindly requested to deliver a condensed
version in the Chamber, on the understanding that they
may distribute the longer version in writing.

I shall now give the floor to members of the
Council.

I shall first give the floor to the representative of
Indonesia. On behalf of the Security Council, I warmly
welcome the presence among us of Mr. Eddy Pratomo,
Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia. I
now give him the floor.
