Mr. van Walsum (Netherlands): I would like to add
a word, if I may, on Iraq's obligations regarding the
repatriation of all Kuwaiti nationals, or their remains. I
did not mention this issue in my intervention this morning
because it was not referred to in the report of the
Secretary-General. But, as other delegations have made
reference to the issue, I would like to join them in
welcoming the appointment of Ambassador Yuli
Vorontsov as high-level coordinator.

The Council should not discuss humanitarian matters
concerning Iraq without reminding the Government of
Iraq of its commitment to facilitate the repatriation of all
Kuwaiti and third country nationals, as reiterated in
operative paragraph 13 of resolution 1284 (1999).
