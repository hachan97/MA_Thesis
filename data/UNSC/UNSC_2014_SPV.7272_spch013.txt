The President: I would just observe that this
meeting will need to end at 5 p.m., and we have a long
list of speakers, including members of the Council. I
would ask speakers to remain respectful of the time
constraints.

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Paul
Kagame, President of the Republic of Rwanda.
