The President: I thank Ms. Guebre Sellassie
for her briefing, and also in particular for the two
recommendations that she made to us, which I hope we
shall be able to consider seriously. I hope that she will
not mind, considering that she has been so focused in
her remarks, if we come back to her with any questions
that members of the Council may want to raise.

I now give the floor to the members of the Security
Council.
