Mr. Musayev (Azerbaijan): I should like briefly
to share with the Council the reasoning behind our
abstention in the voting on resolution 2114 (2013).

First of all, we would like to express our gratitude
to the delegation of the United Kingdom for its
leadership and efforts in facilitating the negotiations on
the resolution. Azerbaijan fully supports the Secretary-
General's good offices mission and the six-month
mandate renewal of the United Nations Peacekeeping
Force in Cyprus. At the same time, similarly to our
approach taken with regard to previous resolutions
on the issue, both conceptual and some textual
considerations again prevented us from voting in favour
of the resolution.

We believe that achieving a mutually acceptable
and comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem,
within the established United Nations parameters, is
possible and within reach. The resolution just adopted
urges the sides to resume their substantive negotiations
and continue their discussions to reach decisive
progress on the core issues, and stresses that the status
quo is unsustainable.

However, in our view, the resolution does not
provide a full and proper update of the situation and
does not place the required emphasis on the necessity
to agree on a results-oriented process. Furthermore, as
a result of the efforts aimed at finding a compromise
rather than reflecting the factual situation, certain
provisions of the resolution do not accurately describe
some of the developments on the ground. This is the
case, for example, with regard to paragraph 5 of the
resolution, in which it would be essential to welcome
not only the efforts to accommodate the Committee on
Missing Persons exhumation requirements, but also the
actual access granted to that end.

For the reasons I have just cited, Azerbaijan decided
to abstain in the voting on resolution 2014 (2013).
