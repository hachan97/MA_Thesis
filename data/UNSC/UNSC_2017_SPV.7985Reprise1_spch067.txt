The President (spoke in Spanish): There are no
more names inscribed on the list of speakers.

On behalf of the Security Council, I would like to
thank all participants in today's open debate for their
input, which will be very important for continuing the
work, not only of the Council but also of the Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1540 (2004), on the
topic that has brought us together for today's debate.

The meeting rose at 5.10pm.
