Mr. Graf zu Rantzau (Germany): My Government
regrets that it was not possible to solve the question
before us today through direct negotiations between the
two parties concerned.

As to the substance of this dispute, the position of
my country is fully reflected in the statement made by the
Representative of France, speaking on behalf of the
European Union, during the Council's debate last Friday,
12 May 1995, and in the declaration of the European
Union Presidency of 15 May 1995.

My delegation is able to vote in favour of the draft
resolution before us because the sponsors were willing to
amend the text by taking fully into account my
Government's concerns and those of our European
partners.

It is our hope that after the Council's discussion of
this issue the parties will in the future deal with and settle

 

this problem through direct negotiations, and that unilateral
acts can he avoided henceforth.

We welcome the statement made by the Government
of Israel on 14 May 1995 that it has no intention to carry
out additional expropriations of land in Jerusalem for
housing purposes, and we expect that controversies which
are harmful to the continuation of the peace process, such
as the one we are dealing with today, can be avoided in the
future.
