Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I would like to join
my colleagues in welcoming our new colleague from
Cote d'Ivoire. We look forward to working with him
and would like to thank Ambassador Alcide Djedje for
his excellent cooperation in the interim.

We voted in favour of resolution 2428 (2018), but
listening to some of the explanations of vote around the
Chamber today, an outside observer could have been
forgiven for thinking that the resolution was about
the peace process. It is not. It is a resolution designed
to protect the people of South Sudan. It imposes a
long-needed arms embargo that will limit the flow
of weapons that fuel the conflict in South Sudan, as
well as further targeted sanctions on two individuals
whose acts have expanded and extended the conflict
and caused immeasurable suffering to the people of
South Sudan. Both targets are military officials, and
there is decisive evidence of responsibility on their
part for human rights abuses. It would be a very sad
commentary on the prospects for peace if those two
measures designed to help the people of South Sudan
were allowed to get in the way of and complicate the
peace process. One cannot and does not advance peace
by ignoring atrocities, and in my experience, if people
are looking for a reason to abandon a peace process,
they will find one, regardless of whether the Council
takes action to protect the people of that country or not.

I would like to make it very clear that we expect
the peace process to continue. We support the efforts of
the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the
African Union and other regional organizations to that
end, and we urge all leaders in South Sudan to work
with them to advance the peace process.
