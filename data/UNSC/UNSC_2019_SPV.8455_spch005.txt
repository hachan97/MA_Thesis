The President (spoke in Spanish): Before
adjourning the meeting, as this is the last Council
meeting scheduled for the month of January, I
would like to express the sincere appreciation of the
delegation of the Dominican Republic to the members
of the Council, especially my colleagues the Permanent
Representatives and their teams, as well as to the
Council secretariat, for all the assistance they provided
us. This has indeed been a very busy month and one in
which we reached consensus on a number of important
issues within our purview. We could not have done it
alone or without the hard work, support and positive
contributions of every delegation and the Secretariat
staff, including the conference officers, interpreters,
translators, verbatim reporters and security officers.

As we conclude our presidency, I know that I
speak on behalf of the entire Council in wishing the
delegation of Equatorial Guinea good luck during the
month of February.

The meeting rose at 5.35 pm.
