Mr. Merores (Haiti) (spoke in French): I
apologize for taking the floor again, but I could not fail
to do so, even if just once more to thank Council
members and all others who spoke this morning. On
behalf of my Government, I thank them for their very
positive comments; the Government will be duly
informed of those comments. I am certain that the
Government will follow up on the recommendations
made as my country moves towards stability.

A number of speakers made reference to the
problem of sexual violence arising from certain
deplorable incidents in certain camps for the displaced.
I assure the Council that the Government is well aware
of these incidents and that, together with the United
Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH)
and the Haitian National Police, it is taking appropriate
measures to remedy the situation and ensure better
protection of women and children.

Finally, I want to convey the gratitude of the
Government and the people of Haiti to Mr. Mulet and
to MINUSTAH. We all know that they are working in
extremely difficult conditions and that they have
nonetheless made it possible for the Government and
the country to make progress towards stabilization.
