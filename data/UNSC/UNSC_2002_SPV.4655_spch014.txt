Mr. Williamson (United States): We believe that
the 3 December signing of a ceasefire agreement
between the Forces for the Defence of Democracy
(FDD) faction, led by Pierre Nkurunziza, and the
Government of Burundi is a significant step towards
achieving peace in that country. We would like to
express our sincere and deep appreciation for the
facilitation efforts led by South African Deputy
President Zuma and conducted with the assistance of
President Bongo of Gabon and President Mkapa of
Tanzania.

In addition, we would like to express our
appreciation to the Regional Initiative and to its
Chairman, President Museveni of Uganda, for their
contributions to the peace process.

While we do not intend to diminish the
achievements of the Facilitation or the contributions of
the Regional Initiative, we believe that, despite the
ceasefire agreement, the situation in Burundi still
warrants close monitoring by the Security Council.
Specifically, the Council should seek to encourage all
parties to observe the provisions of the ceasefire
agreement, while remaining alert to any indicators that
the situation is devolving towards a mass killing
scenario.

In addition, we remain concerned that the FNL,
led by Agathon Rwasa, continues its campaign of
violence, refuses to sign a ceasefire agreement and
remains outside of the Arusha process. We believe that
the leaders of those armed groups that have remained
outside of the process must face consequences. We
support the call by President Museveni for regionally
imposed sanctions.
