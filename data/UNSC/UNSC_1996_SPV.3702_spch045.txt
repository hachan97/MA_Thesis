The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank
the representative of Cape Verde for the kind words he
addressed to me.

The next speaker is the distinguished Vice Minister
for Foreign Affairs and Worship of Costa Rica, His
Excellency Mr. Rodrigo Carreras. I invite him to take a
seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
