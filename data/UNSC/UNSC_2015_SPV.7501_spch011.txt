Mr. Van Bohemen (New Zealand): New Zealand
was pleased to support and co-sponsor resolution 2235
(2015), which we have just adopted.
Chemical weapons are an appalling weapon. The
international community showed its revulsion of these
weapons and its determination to stamp them out in
the negotiation and adoption of the Chemical Weapons
Convention. The adoption of resolution 2118 (2013) was
a highly important step by the Council in responding
to reports confirming the use of chemical weapons in
Syria. The Syrian regime's acceptance of that resolution
and its decision, albeit belated, to join the Chemical
Weapons Convention and to cooperate in the destruction
of its chemical-weapons stocks were welcome. A major
international effort led by the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has been under way
to remove and destroy those weapons.

Yet, reports have continued to come out of Syria
that chemical weapons continue to be used. This is
monstrous, even in the context of that thoroughly
horrible conflict. Accordingly, it is right and proper that
the Council has now adopted a Mechanism to enable
the identification of those responsible and to hold them
to account. Those who use or authorize the use of such
weapons must be held to account for their dreadful
deeds. We welcome agreement on the text of resolution
2235 (2015) as an all-too-rare example of collective
Council action on the Syrian conflict. We hope that the
spirit of cooperation that underlies the resolution will
embue the Council's efforts to address and resolve the
wider Syrian conflict.
