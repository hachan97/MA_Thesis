Mr. Gaspar Martins (Angola): Angola has voted
in favour of resolution 1556 (2004) and we did so with
a sense of having accomplished a duty.

Terrorism is a common threat to peace and
security and a common challenge to the international
community as a whole. Therefore it is only logical that
the Council has unanimously voted for this resolution,
which constitutes an important landmark in the fight
against terrorism.

Over the past 25 years, Angola has been the
victim of terrorist acts. We can therefore understand
the importance of standing united in the fight against
terrorism, regardless of who the terrorists are or what
their political, philosophical, ideological, religious or
other motivations may be. The victims of terrorism
deserve our solidarity, particularly as they are usually
civilians and, quite often, children.

The resolution we have just adopted is good news
and we thank the sponsors, particularly the Russian
Federation, for the constructive approach they
demonstrated throughout the long negotiations. We
have a good instrument and now it is up to all States to
put it to work to strengthen cooperation in the global
fight in which we are all involved.
