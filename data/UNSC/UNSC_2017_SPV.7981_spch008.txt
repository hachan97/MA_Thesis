Mr. Cardi (Italy) (Spoke in French): At the outset
I should like, on behalf of my Government, to once
again convey our condolences to the families of the two
members of the Group of Experts on the Democratic
Republic of the Congo killed in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo - Michael Sharp and Zaida
Catalan. We also extend our sympathy and solidarity to
Chile, Sweden and the United States.

We commend the unanimous adoption of resolution
2360 (2017). It sends a strong message about the unity
ofthe Security Council on this important topic. I should
like to thank the French delegation for its efforts in
drafting the text, which conveys the Council's energetic
and explicit condemnation over the murder of the
two Experts.

At the same time, the resolution enables us to
condemn the violence in Kasais. Italy is extremely
concerned about the deteriorating humanitarian
situation in those provinces, about human rights
violations and the shrinking of the democratic space
in the country. We are therefore convinced of the need
to continue to implement the New Year agreement of
31 December 2016, which is critical to supporting the
legitimacy of the transitional institutions.

Given the country's situation, which remains
very difficult, Italy endeavours to work alongside the
members of the Council and assisting the Democratic
Republic of the Congo to achieve stabilization.
