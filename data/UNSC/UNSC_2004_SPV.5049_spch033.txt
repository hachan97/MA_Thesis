Mr. Kitaoka (Japan): Japan is greatly concerned
about the recent clashes between the Israelis and the
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, which have caused many
casualties. We are deeply worried that such clashes will
trigger another cycle of violence, making it still more
difficult to bring about peace between the two parties.

In order to prevent a further deterioration of the
situation, Japan strongly urges the Israeli side to
exercise the maximum restraint and the Palestinian side
to make the utmost efforts to control the extremists and
to produce tangible results in that regard. We also urge
both sides to promptly resume their efforts to
implement the road map.
