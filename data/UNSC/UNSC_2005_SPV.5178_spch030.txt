Mr. Sardenberg (Brazil): Let me first take this
opportunity, Madam President, to join those who have
extended their congratulations to you and to the
delegation of Denmark for your presidency this month,
which is already showing itself to be successful. I also
wish to thank Ambassador Wang Guangya and our
Chinese colleagues for their excellent work in the
presidency last month.

I think this has been a valuable debate, with
substantive contributions and assessments by Council
members and other Members of the Organization. A
remarkable coincidence can be seen in the statements
this morning. As a result of our debate and of the work
and recommendations of the mission, the Council will
be in a position to consider, in an appropriate manner,
the issues relating to Haiti, including the extension of
MINUSTAH's mandate at the end of this month.

I wish to make a comment in response to a
concern expressed by Ambassador Sealy of Trinidad
and Tobago, speaking for the CARICOM. countries. I
refer to the case of Mr. Yvon Neptune, a case that is
mentioned in paragraph 44 of our report. In Haiti, long
detentions while pending cases are awaiting trial, are,
unfortunately, the rule and not the exception.
Notwithstanding that circumstance, the status of high-
level authorities of the former Government should be
taken into account in order, inter alia, to enhance
national reconciliation while preparations for elections
are under way. Therefore the mission, in its contacts
with the authorities and the press while in Haiti,
stressed the need to speed up such cases.
Finally, I wish to wholeheartedly thank our
colleagues for their contributions to the work of the
mission and also for their words addressed to our
delegation, Brazil, and to myself personally. I also
thank the Secretariat for the very able support the
personnel gave our mission.
