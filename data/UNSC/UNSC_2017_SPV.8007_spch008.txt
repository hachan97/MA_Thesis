Mr. Skoog (Sweden): Like others, I would like
to thank the United States for introducing resolution
2368 (2017) today, which improves the tools at the
disposal of the international community in combating
international terrorism.
Sweden welcomes the unanimous adoption of
today's resolution and the substantive updates to the
sanctions regime. As the Islamic State in Iraq and
the Levant (ISIL)/Da'esh and Al-Qaida develop new
strategies and adapt to a changing landscape, the
sanctions regime must be adjusted so as to effectively
counter the threat posed by those groups. In particular,
we welcome the substantive additions with regard to
trafficking in persons, while linking the sanctions
regime to landmark resolution 2331 (2016). Once again,
the Security Council has reaffirmed its intention to
consider targeted sanctions for individuals and entities
that are associated with ISIL or Al-Qaida and involved
in trafficking in persons in areas affected by armed
conflict and in sexual violence in conflict.

The Office ofthe Ombudsperson is a demonstration
of the Council's commitment to fulfilling due-process
requirements, and the Office is essential to the
effectiveness of the sanctions regime. We wish, in that
connection, to take this opportunity to congratulate
the Ombudsperson, Catherine Marchi-Uhel, on her
important appointment as Head of the International,
Impartial and Independent Mechanism to Assist in the
Investigation and Prosecution of Persons Responsible
for the Most Serious Crimes under International Law
Committed in the Syrian Arab Republic since March
2011, and thank her for her outstanding work. We ask
the Secretary-General and the Secretariat to facilitate a
swift transition.
