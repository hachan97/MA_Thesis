Mr. Denisov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Right up until the time of today's vote, the
members of the Council continued to work on the draft
resolution containing the response of the Security
Council to the latest report of the Mehlis Commission.
We had very much hoped that Council members would
be able to overcome their differences of opinion and
reach a consensus on that document. Despite the
continuing divergences of View, we were able to come
to an agreement, and the resolution was adopted
unanimously.

We proposed our own amendments to the texts
prepared by our French and American colleagues,
which made it more balanced in nature, without,
however, fully freeing it of negativism with respect to
Syria - unnecessary in the current situation. We
continue to oppose unwarranted pressure on Damascus,
as well as interpretations with respect to the degree and
nature of Syrian cooperation with international
investigators that are not in keeping with the
conclusions of the Mehlis Commission.

We have noted that Damascus began cooperating
with the Mehlis Commission on the basis of the
provisions of resolution 1636 (2005). So far, the Syrian
side has taken only initial steps in that respect; it still
has considerable distance to cover.

The Security Council must monitor the manner in
which the Syrian side meets its obligations and, where
necessary, assist it.

We would also reiterate Russia's firm conviction
of the need to continue efforts to establish the facts
with respect to the circumstances surrounding the death
of the former Prime Minister of Lebanon, Rafik Hariri.
