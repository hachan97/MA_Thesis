The President: I thank Mr. Yacouba for the
clarifications provided.

I thank all colleagues for what has been an excellent
and thoroughly interactive discussion. I am particularly
grateful to our three Police Commissioners for finding
the time to brief the Security Council. Under-Secretary-
General Lacroix is a more regular fixture, but it was
good to have him, as well. I thank Ms. Fitah-Kona for
joining us from Bangui, where, I know, it is now quite
late, and for staying with us.

It has been a rich opportunity to get information
from those working on the ground. With particular
regard to the Police Commissioners and those who
serve under them, they have the gratitude and respect
of the Council, which sends them on deployment and
is very conscious of its obligations when it does so.
I would also like to thank our interpreters for their
excellent work, as always, our colleagues from Security
Council Affairs Division and our conference officers
for all they do.

The meeting rose at 5.50 pm.
