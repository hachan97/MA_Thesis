Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The worsening piracy off the coast of
Somalia requires that the international community
2

adopt qualitatively new measures to combat it. Today,
we have taken a great step forward in combating
piracy. The resolution adopted on our initiative
includes a broad array of qualitatively new measures
aimed at establishing the necessary conditions to more
effectively counteract pirates. It generally draws on the
ideas of Mr. Jack Lang, Special Adviser to the
Secretary-General on Legal Issues Related to Piracy
off the Coast of Somalia, which enjoy broad
international support, and takes in an entire set of
problems related to the growing piracy threat.

For the Russian Federation, it is important that
the resolution includes special emphasis on combating
impunity for pirates. The request on the Secretary-
General to report to the Council on practical aspects
for establishing national anti-piracy courts in Somalia
and a specialized Somali anti-piracy court with
international components on the territory of a third
State is a first practical step towards establishing an
effective judicial mechanism capable of providing a
credible and reliable solution to the problem of
bringing pirates to justice. We look forward to
receiving a thorough report from the Secretary-General
that includes concrete proposals on the modalities for
establishing such anti-piracy courts. For our part, we
are prepared to provide the Secretary-General with all
the necessary support to carry out that work.

Allow me to express our appreciation to all the
members of the Council for their cooperation, support
and determination to achieve compromise. We are also
grateful to our colleagues for their valuable ideas,
which made it possible for us to strengthen the
resolution and to lend momentum to this important
anti-piracy initiative.
