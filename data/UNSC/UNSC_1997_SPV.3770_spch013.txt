Mr. Richardson (United States of America): It has
been six years since Somali faction leaders overthrew the
Government of the dictator Siad Barre and two years
since the withdrawal of the United Nations Operation in
Somalia (UNOSOM) forces from Somalia, yet the
Somalis have still not formed a national government.

The United States believes that the Somali faction
leaders themselves must make the difficult decisions
required to reach a viable reconciliation process. We have
followed and will continue to follow closely events in the
Horn of Africa region. We support the efforts of regional
leaders, the Organization of African Unity, the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the League
of Arab States, Italy and others who have tried to
facilitate negotiations.

But outsiders cannot bring peace to Somalia. The
international community can only assist the efforts of
Somalis to reach their own solutions to the crisis and to
move towards peace, stability, law, order and national
reconciliation. We urge all Somali leaders to end the
divisions that keep them from political reconciliation and
to work towards a broad-based national government that
represents all the Somali people.
