Mr. Ebner (Austria): Austria regrets that the
Council was not able to agree today on the draft
technical rollover resolution before us. We firmly
believe that the United Nations Mission monitoring
and verifying a security regime continues to be crucial
for stability in the region and therefore is in
everybody's interest. The Mission has played a key
role in improving the situation of the internally
displaced and refugee population in the area. We
therefore attach great important to a continued United
Nations presence.

We supported and continue to support the concept
of a rollover resolution so as to give the Council the
extra time necessary for negotiations. We affirm our
commitment to the sovereignty, independence and
territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally
recognized borders.

The last two technical rollover resolutions -
resolutions 1839 (2008) and 1866 (2009), which
enjoyed consensus on the Council - both made
explicit reference to resolution 1808 (2008). Austria
believes that there have been no major changes in the
situation over the past three months that would justify
the deletion of such a reference in the draft resolution
before us.
