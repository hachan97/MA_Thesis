The President: I thank the Minister for Foreign
Affairs and International Cooperation of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo for his kind words
addressed to me and to my country.

I shall now call on the members of the Council.
In addition to the 15 Council members, 6 others have
requested to take the floor on this subject, so I
emphasize the need for brevity and focus with regard to
the statements that are going to be made here.
