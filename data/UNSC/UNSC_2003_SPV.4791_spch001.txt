The President (spoke in Spanish): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special
Representative of the Secretary-General for Iraq.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Vieira de Mello to take a seat at the
Council table.

I should like to inform the Council that I have
received a letter dated 17 July 2003 from the
Permanent Representative of Spain to the United
Nations, which reads as follows:

"I have the honour to address you, as
President of the Security Council for the month of
July, in order to request that Mr. Adnan Pachachi,
Mr. Ahmad Chalabi and Ms. Aqeela al-Hashemi,
members of the Governing Council of Iraq, be
allowed to participate in the Security Council
meeting that will take place on Tuesday, 22 July
2003, concerning the item entitled 'The situation
between Iraq and Kuwait', in accordance with
rule 39 of the provisional rules of procedure of
the Security Council."

That letter has been published as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol S/2003/750.

If I hear no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Adnan Pachachi, Mr. Ahmad Chalabi
and Ms. Aqeela al-Hashemi to take seats at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph
24 of Security Council resolution 1483 (2003),
document S/2003/715.

I welcome the presence of the Secretary-General,
Mr. Kofi Annan, and I invite him to take the floor.
