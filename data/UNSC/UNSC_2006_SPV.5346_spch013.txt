The President: I shall now make some remarks
in my capacity as the representative of the United
Republic of Tanzania.

I wish to join others in congratulating the
Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of
Belgium, Mr. Karel de Gucht, on the assumption of the
chairmanship of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and in thanking him for
his briefing this morning. We also pay tribute to the
outgoing Chairman, Mr. Dimitrij Rupel, Minister for
Foreign Affairs of Slovenia, for his work while he was
in office.

The OSCE is doing a commendable job in
complementing the task of the United Nations of
maintaining peace and security and in responding to
threats to peace in the areas that fall under its mandate.

Although the Organization encountered many
challenges last year, it responded to them in a
professional and exemplary manner and prevented the
further escalation of conflicts in Central Asia and the
Caucuses. It also took on board the running of police
development units, coordinated and implemented
conventions and protocols on antiterrorism and
addressed economic and environmental threats to
security.

The priorities that the OSCE has set for itself
during the Belgian chairmanship - which include the
promotion of the rule of law, the penal systems, access
to justice, combating international crime and a whole
range of economic and political matters - are very
high goals that, we are sure, the OSCE will fulfil to the
best of its ability.

The activities of the OSCE are a great source of
encouragement to other, similar organizations around
the world to complement the objectives of the United
Nations. For us in Africa, it provides an example worth
emulating in the areas of security, regional political
institutions, human rights and development.

I now resume my function as President of the
Council.

I now give the floor to Mr. Karel de Gucht to
respond to comments and questions raised.
