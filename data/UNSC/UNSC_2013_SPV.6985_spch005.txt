The President: I thank Mr. Ladsous for his briefing.

I recognize that we are discussing the launch of
an important new mission, but maybe this is the time
to remind Secretariat briefers that they should limit
their remarks to 15 minutes. We have made some good
progress in recent months in restricting the size of the
written reports from the Secretary-General, but we
seem to be going in the opposite direction in terms of
the oral briefings from the Secretariat to the Council.
I now give the floor to Ms. Haq.
