Mr. Ouch (Cambodia): First of all, may I
congratulate you, Sir, in your capacity as President of the
Security Council for the month of September. I am
convinced that you can steer the debate of the Council on
this difficult and complex issue in the right direction so
that we can find a way out of this dilemma in our part of
the world.

As a member of the Association of South-East Asian
Nations (ASEAN), Cambodia is following with keen
interest the events in our fellow ASEAN country,
Indonesia, which is undergoing a process of transition and
change. The events in East Timor which we are
witnessing every day must therefore be seen in the
context of Indonesia's efforts to introduce reform into its
system as it moves towards democracy. I wish therefore
to extend our congratulations to Indonesia on its initiative
to give the people of East Timor a choice between
accepting widespread autonomy and independence from
Indonesia. This is indeed a noble step, and we have seen
that the ballot, organized by the United Nations, was
successful, with no disturbances taking place during the
voting or the counting of the ballots. Having experienced
an election ourselves under the auspices of the United
Nations in 1993, I must congratulate Indonesia and the
United Nations for the success of this major operation,
which will herald a new era for East Timor. This was not
an easy task.

However, we are very concerned about the recent
Violence which has occurred in East Timor, and we have
acknowledged the latest efforts made by the Indonesian
Government to rectify the situation. We urge the
Indonesian Government to make further efforts to bring
this violence to a speedy end and, together with the

 

United Nations, to implement the May 5 Agreement in a
peaceful and cooperative manner.

Cambodia wishes that the decision to be taken by the
Security Council should take into consideration the report
of the fact-finding mission and respect for the sovereignty
of Indonesia.
