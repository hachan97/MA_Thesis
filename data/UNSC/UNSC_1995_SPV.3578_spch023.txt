Mr. Zawels (Argentina) (interpretation from Spanish): With the resolution that we have just adopted,
this Council has dedicated itself to one of its most
delicate functions - that of deciding, on the basis of the
behaviour of a State, on the regime of sanctions imposed
on it. In accordance with what we have stated at past
meetings, we completely agree with the provisions of
resolution 1015 (1995), which we believe to be an
adequate response to developments and to the attitude of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), not only as regards the closure of its border
with the territories of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the
control of the local Serb authorities, but also as regards
its participation in the peace process.

Most of the news reaching us today from the
Balkans makes it possible for us to have moderate but
firm optimism as regards the results of the peace process.
We hope that the day is not too far off when it will no
longer be necessary to use the sanctions regime in order
to maintain international peace and security in that region.

Finally, we wish to express our sincere appreciation
to all the personnel of the Mission of the International
Conference on the Former Yugoslavia. Thanks to them,
every time this Council has reviewed the regime of
sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(Serbia and Montenegro), it has had a clear and objective
view of a reality with which it must be familiar in order
to take the decisions entrusted to it.
