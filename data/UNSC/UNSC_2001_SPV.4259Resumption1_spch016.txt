Mr. Guehenno: I would just like to say how
heartened I have been and encouraged by the debate
that took place today, and I would like to thank the
members of the Council for their supportive statements
of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and of
our strengthened cooperation with UNAIDS. Such
announcements as the one made by the Minister of
International Development of Norway provide a
tremendous boost to the efforts of all those in the
United Nations system who want to take an ever more
active role in the global war against AIDS.

I would also like to say, to borrow Ambassador
Holbrooke's own words, that I did not take any of his
remarks personally. On the contrary, I consider them as
a reflection of the priority that he rightly attaches to the
issue of HIV/AIDS, and I welcome the suggestions that

were made. Ambassador Holbrooke can be forceful in
his criticism. He has also been effectively forceful in
his support of peacekeeping. and for that I would like
to put on record that he will enjoy the lasting gratitude
of all peacekeepers. I would be grateful to the United
States delegation if it would convey to the Ambassador
our gratitude.
