The President: I wish to remind all speakers to
limit their statements to no more than four minutes in
order to enable the Council to hear from all speakers
who are on the list this afternoon. If delegations have
longer statements, they are kindly requested to circulate
the texts in writing and to deliver a summarized version
when speaking in the Chamber. The red light on the
collar of the microphone will begin to flash after four
minutes have elapsed.

I now give the floor to the representative Rwanda.
