Mr. Singer Weisinger (Dominican Republic):
I would like to congratulate the French-German
presidency for resolution 2463 (2019). But I would
also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the
French presidency on the first part of the French-
German presidency, which sends a significant message
of European Union unity. I must congratulate your
excellent team, Mr. President, and express my hope
that my friend the German Ambassador has learned
many tips from this presidency and that of the
Dominican Republic.
