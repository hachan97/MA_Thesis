Mr. Parham (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom welcomes the adoption of this resolution,
which makes arrangements for the continuation of
essential legal functions of the International Criminal
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR)
following the completion of the Tribunals' trials and
appeals, including by making provision for the trials of
the remaining fugitives, who must be brought to
justice.

The resolution requests the ICTR and ICTY to
take all possible measures to complete their remaining
work as provided by the resolution by the end of 2014.
In making that request, we encourage both Tribunals to
continue to explore all steps to ensure completion
without further delay, while respecting the need for due
process and judicial independence.
