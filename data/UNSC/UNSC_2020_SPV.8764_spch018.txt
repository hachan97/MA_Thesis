Mr. Allen (United Kingdom): I really fail to understand why these games are being played by such an expert delegation as the Russian delegation. You have been here, as we have, for 75 years. You know that if a briefer is proposed under rule 39, the Council can either accept that, as happens in the majority of cases, without any vote at all, or a Council member can raise an objection, as Christoph has reminded us, as your colleague Gennady did in 2018, when I was present in the Security Council Chamber (see S/PV.8209). You are proposing a briefer. You have been told that the Council does not unanimously accept that briefer. You therefore need to get nine votes in favour of the briefer. There is no debate or discussion about that. That is simply how the rules of procedure work, Mr. President.
