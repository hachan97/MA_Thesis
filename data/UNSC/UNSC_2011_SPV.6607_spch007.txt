Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We thank the Chair of the Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1737 (2006),
Permanent Representative of Columbia Nestor Osorio,
for his briefing on the work of the Committee over the
past three months. The Committee has worked actively
in the reporting period in strict compliance with its
mandate. The Committee must continue to work
specifically along those lines, as must its Panel of
Experts, which provides useful and practical assistance
to the Committee. It is extremely important that the
work of the experts be impartial and independent, and
that they use only reliable sources and verified
information.

Russia strictly complies with all requirements of
the sanctions regime against Iran. By and large, we
believe that in order to ensure the maximum
effectiveness of that regime, all members of the
international community must strictly comply with the
relevant resolutions of the Security Council, and not
deviate from them.

With respect to the current situation regarding
Iran's nuclear programme, we have consistently been
in favour of resolving all problems through dialogue
with the Iranian side. We are convinced that, with no
alternative to a political and diplomatic approach, we
must find compromise solutions that would enable us
to move towards the stated aim of removing any doubt
over the purely peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear
programme. Iran will then be able to fully enjoy all the
rights of a non-nuclear weapon State under the Treaty
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

Russia will do its utmost for the swift resumption
of talks between the E3+3 and Iran.
