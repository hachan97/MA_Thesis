The Secretary-General: I would, very briefly, like
to thank you, Mr. President, and the members of the
Council for having focused attention on this very
important issue, and for having invited President Mandela,
as Facilitator, to join us in our work.

I think we have demonstrated to the Facilitator and
to the people of Burundi and their leaders that we are
prepared to work with them on the peace process, and
that if they work honestly and sincerely with President
Mandela to push the process forward, the Council and the
entire United Nations will be there to work alongside
them. I think they owe it to the people of Burundi, to the
region and to Africa. I hope that when next we meet we
will have considerable progress to report.

The meeting rose at 12.45 pm.
