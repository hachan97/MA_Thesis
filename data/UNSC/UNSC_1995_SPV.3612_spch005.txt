The President (interpretation from Russian): It is my
understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to the
vote on the draft resolution (S/1995/1047) before it. If I
hear no objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the
vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council who
wish to make statements before the voting.
