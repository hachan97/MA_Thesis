The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as the representative of the United Kingdom.

We are pleased to see the Government under new
consensus Prime Minister Gomes, whom we welcome
today, now working towards legislative elections on
18 November. Holding free, fair, credible and transparent
legislative elections in 2018, in accordance with the
Constitution and national laws and commitments,
is critical.

Discussions on a stability pact, flowing from the
Conakry Agreement, have also started the process of
reflection on longer-term reform to the security sector,
justice, administration and the Constitution. These
will help Guinea-Bissau to achieve political stability
and sustainable peace over the longer term. As our
civil society briefer made clear, an inclusive approach,
particularly including women, will be vital.

The United Kingdom is grateful to the United
Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-
Bissau (UNIOGBIS) for its work in the country,
realigning its work to its revised mandate. In particular,
we welcome the support of UNIOGBIS for legislative
elections and political dialogue.

With regard to sanctions, we are satisfied that
targeted sanctions are having the intended impact,
limiting the influence of those under sanctions to have
a disruptive impact on the Conakry Agreement and
providing a disincentive to military entry to politics.
The United Kingdom supports the scheduled review
of European Union and United Nations sanctions in
summer 2019, after the presidential elections.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

I give the floor to the Prime Minister of Guinea-
Bissau.
