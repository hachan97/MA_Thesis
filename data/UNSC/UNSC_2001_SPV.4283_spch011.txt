Mr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I would like to associate myself with the
words of welcome to the Minister for External
Relations of Angola and with the words of gratitude
extended to Ambassador Richard Ryan for the
statement he made at the beginning of our discussion.

As one of the observer States for the
implementation of the Angola peace process, Russia,
like the United States, fully associates itself with the
statement to be made today by the Permanent
Representative of Portugal to the United Nations,
Ambassador Antonio Monteiro, on behalf ofthe troika.

I should like to add briefly that we believe that
the current sanctions against UNITA are the most
effective instrument available for applying pressure, on
behalf of the international community, on the combat
wing of UNITA, headed by Savimbi. We are also
convinced that peace in Angola can be restored only on
the basis of the principles of the Lusaka Protocol.
Together with other colleagues, we welcome the
productive work carried out by the Monitoring
Mechanism on sanctions against UNITA, under the
leadership of Ambassador Juan Larrain, pursuant to
Security Council resolution 1295 (2000). The report
submitted to the Security Council will no doubt help to
increase the effectiveness of sanctions against UNITA.

Russia, both in its national capacity and as a
member of the troika, will promote concrete steps
designed to ensure that all the members of the
international community scrupulously observe Security
Council sanctions against UNITA. This pertains, first
and foremost, to those States neighbouring Angola. We
will consistently pursue a policy to strengthen the
effectiveness of such a regime and to enhance the
United Nations Monitoring Mechanism, which has
performed well.
