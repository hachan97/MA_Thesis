Mr. Fall (Guinea) (spoke in French): I will be
brief. I have a couple of comments on Sierra Leone.
We will look at the question of the Mano river basin
region this afternoon. Almost all members of the
Council recognize that the mandate given to the United
Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) was a
clear and precise mandate which facilitated the success
of the operation. I note the key role played by the
United Kingdom in the past, and today, in stabilizing
the situation in Sierra Leone. Let me repeat:
UNAMSIL's role is not over. It must continue to
support ongoing activities until there is lasting peace in
Sierra Leone. The international community must also
continue its work, helping to stabilize the situation in
Sierra Leone, which can bolster the efforts made to
date.

What has been done in Sierra Leone is something
innovative, something that can also serve as a model
for other parts of Africa. The success of the operation
in Sierra Leone, if we look at it squarely, contains some
elements we must take into account. Here, we are also
thinking of Liberia, and other countries in Africa. We
believe this example should be considered and
analysed by the Council, so that all the lessons of the
successful Sierra Leone experience are learned and so
that the Council can make progress elsewhere in
Africa.
