The President: There are no further speakers
inscribed on my list. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.

Before adjourning, I would like to inform
members that in order to allow sufficient time for the
translation of the draft resolution on the United Nations
Mission in Nepal to be completed, I propose to invite
members to consultations on the Sudan now and to
return to the Council Chamber thereafter.

The meeting rose at 10.45 am.
