Mr. Geng Shuang (China) (spoke in Chinese): I note my failure to understand the proposal raised by the representative of the United Kingdom, on behalf of some members of the Council, concerning Mr. Bustani, former Director General of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), who has rich experience, unique insights and knowledge of the working methods and procedures of the OPCW. Mr. Bustani is very knowledgeable about the chemical weapon issue and is well suited to be a briefer. His briefing would bring unique value to this meeting. If I am not mistaken, at previous Council meetings where speakers have been invited to give briefings in accordance with rule 39 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure, some have not been nearly as professional or representative as Mr. Bustani. However, at those meetings, other members did not try to block such briefers or raise objections to their being invited in accordance with rule 39 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure. I would therefore like to express my regret over the practice of the United Kingdom representative and other Council members. I propose that we take a procedural vote on the proposal put forward by the representative of the United Kingdom so that we know how many members really oppose the invitation extended to Mr. Bustani as a briefer.
