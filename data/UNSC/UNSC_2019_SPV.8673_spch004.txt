The President: As I shall not read out the statement
(S/PRST/2019/l4) in the interest of time, I will just
make it clear, for those watching and listening, that
the presidential statement is about the briefing that
the Council received from the Director-General of the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
(OPCW) on 5 November (see S/PV.8659), under the
agenda item "The situation in the Middle East",
and it is also about cooperation between the United
Nations and the OPCW and upholding the Chemical
Weapons Convention. It does not go into any questions
of attribution.

I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the
representative of the United Kingdom.

I would just like to say that I support what the
French representative said. There are some differences
among Council members on attribution, but it is very
important that all Member States, including the Syrian
Arab Republic, abide by their commitments under the
Chemical Weapons Convention.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

The meeting rose at 3.10pm.
