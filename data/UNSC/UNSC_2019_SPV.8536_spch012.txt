Mrs. Gueguen (France) (spoke in French): France
welcomes the adoption of resolution 2471 (2019), which
extends the sanctions regime against South Sudan,
a country with a civilian population that has been
tragically tried and tested by violence. France shares
the opinion expressed by the other European members
of the Security Council. The sanctions regime continues
to be an especially important tool that contributes
to stabilizing South Sudan. It is a tool to support the
implementation of the Revitalized Agreement on the
Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South
Sudan and deprive the parties to the conflict of the
means to commit violence.

The spread of weapons in the country constitutes
a genuine scourge. France calls on the South Sudanese
authorities, as well as the countries of the region, to
fully implement the arms embargo. We also recall that
individual sanctions, in order to be effectively applied,
require the mobilization and engagement of all regional
and international actors. France remains extremely
concerned about the level of human rights violations,
including the level of sexual violence. We call for an
end to all forms of violence and for ensuring that those
responsible are brought to justice.

Lastly, France would like to express its hope that
the Security Council will systematically use sanctions
to punish and bring pressure to bear on those who
commit sexual violence, especially since it is now an
independent criterion for sanctions designation.

I would like to conclude by congratulating you,
Mr. President, and your team on your successful
presidency of the Council this month.
