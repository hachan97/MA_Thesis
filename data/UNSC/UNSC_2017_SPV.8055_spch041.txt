Mr. Rabbani (Afghanistan): What we heard earlier
today from the representative of Pakistan was but
another attempt to divert international attention from
its open and explicit support for terrorism and violent
extremism. All of us here today are well aware of the
security dynamics in Afghanistan and in the region,
and I should therefore not have to go into great detail
about Pakistan's long-term and long-standing use
of terror and violent extremism as an instrument of
foreign policy.

The main factor for insecurity in Afghanistan
therefore relates directly to the export of violent proxy
groups into Afghanistan from within Pakistan. As we
stated last week before the General Assembly (see A/72/PV.6), these facts have been verified by various
members of the international coalition present in
Afghanistan. It is on this basis that Afghanistan has
called on the Security Council to take specific action in
defence of the Charter of the United Nations.

With all that Afghanistan and Pakistan have in
common, as beautifully outlined by the representative
of Pakistan, we are keen to see genuine and
comprehensive State-to-State discourse on peace,
security and prosperity. We hope to see constructive
engagement rather than a continuation of the all-too-
familiar plausible deniability and various attempts to
change the narrative through fake and distorted images,
facts and figures. This kind of behaviour will bear no
fruit for peace. The policy of deception has no future.
Pakistan should instead seize the opportunity to reverse
course and choose the path of adhering to the Charter
of the United Nations.
