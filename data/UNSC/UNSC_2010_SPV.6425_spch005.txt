The President: I would like to thank Mr. Mbeki
for his briefing and for all of the work that he is
undertaking, and particularly for speaking to the
Council from such a distance. Although we could not
see him, let me assure him that we listened very
carefully to what he said. I take back everything I said
about a power failure in Johannesburg. We will blame
New York, instead, for all of the technical difficulties.

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Ali
Ahmed Karti, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the
Sudan.
