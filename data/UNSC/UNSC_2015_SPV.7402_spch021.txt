Ms. Mogherini (spoke in French): I would like to
thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to have
participated in this debate, which was very important
for me personally and for the European Union. I assure
you that I am ready, both personally and on behalf of
the European Union, to work to maintain our friendship
and partnership with the United Nations, and the
Security Council in particular, in the months and years
to come. As you said, the European Union is not only
a regional organization, it is also the most significant
regional integration process in the world.
