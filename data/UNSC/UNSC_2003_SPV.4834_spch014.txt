Mr. De La Sabliere (France) (spoke in French):
I, too, would like to thank the Assistant Secretary-
General for Political Affairs, Mr. Kalomoh, for his
thorough briefing, which gave us much information on
the situation on the ground, and the Special Envoy of
the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, Mr.
Ramos Horta, who made a very useful contribution to
the work of the Council this morning.

France condemned the coup d'etat that took place
on 14 September along the lines of the principles
established by the African Union. We support the
approach taken by the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS), and we also believe that it
was good that the Security Council affirmed in its
previous statement that in such situations regional and
subregional organizations could be of great assistance.
ECOWAS has shown over the past few years the extent
to which its contribution could be useful.

Like those who have preceded me, I believe that,
despite the developments that have been described to
us as little cause for alarm, it is important that the
Security Council should follow the situation closely.
We have therefore taken note of the information given
us this morning on the resignation of President Kumba
Yala and the transition arrangements. It seems that the
path is now clear for restoring constitutional order, but
the civilian transitional authorities must do everything
that they can to ensure prompt, fair, credible and
transparent legislative elections, which have been
scheduled for 12 October. In that respect, I would like
to take up the question posed by Ambassador Konuzin:
It would be good to know what the United Nations can
do to help to ensure that the deadline that has been set
is met.
