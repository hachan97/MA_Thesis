Mr. Ingolfsson (Iceland): Iceland has aligned
itself with the statement made by Greece on behalf of
the European Union. In addition, Iceland would like to
state the following.

Iceland regrets that Iraq has had to face the
serious consequences of military action. This would
not have been necessary had the Iraqi regime decided
to change its attitude and cooperated immediately,
actively and fully, as it was obliged to do under
resolution 1441 (2002).

The Icelandic Government has given its political
support to the coalition of States assembled for the
immediate disarmament of Iraq. This is due to our
conviction that action was necessary to ensure the
implementation of all relevant United Nations
resolutions regarding the disarmament of Iraq.

We urge Member States of the United Nations to
unite in the work ahead and to secure a full United
Nations role in providing humanitarian assistance to
the Iraqi people and in the post-war reconstruction of
their country. The Iraqi people need the full support of
the international community to be able to rise again in
prosperity, democracy, dignity and peaceful co-
existence with their neighbours after decades of
dictatorship and aggression.
