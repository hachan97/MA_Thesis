Mr. Yel'chenko (Ukraine): On behalf of my
Government, I would like to express my sincere thanks to
you, Mr. President, and through you to all members of the
Security Council, for the condolences just expressed in
connection with the tragic accident at the coal mine in the
eastern part of Ukraine.

As a result of the gas explosion in the coal mine, more
than 80 workers were killed. Our Government has set up a
special commission to investigate the tragic accident, which
is the biggest of its kind in the history of my country.

I will immediately convey your condolences, which
are a source of great moral support, to my Government and
to the families of the deceased.
