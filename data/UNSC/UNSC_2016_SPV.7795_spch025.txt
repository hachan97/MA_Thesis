Mr. O'Brien: I thank you, Sir, for the opportunity
to speak again. As an international civil servant acting
impartially, I do not retract, qualify or disclaim any fact
or part of my earlier statement, which, I can assure you
and each and every member of the Council, that I and
my team and the wider United Nations have put together
with great care, seriousness and professionalism.

I am prompted to state the age-old truth: Do not
shoot the messenger. Rather, I urge the Council to stand
up for the beleaguered people of Syria and to seize
the opportunity that I described of taking leadership
and those steps that are available to the Council and
which they can take to stop the violence now, to stop
the war now.

The United Nations continues its work undeterred.
It remains ready to work with all parties to deliver
humanitarian assistance, protect civilians and reach
people in need. While humanitarians have a particular
role, rest assured that we will work as one United
Nations, including our support for Staffan de Mistura
and his work.

I conclude by simply paying an undiluted tribute
and saluting again the brave, undeterred, faithful
humanitarian workers in Syria working tirelessly for
the people of Syria, who are caught up in this terrible
endless crisis and need life support and protection.
