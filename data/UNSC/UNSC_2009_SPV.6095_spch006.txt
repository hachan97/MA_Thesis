Mr. Ripert (France) (spoke in French): Given the
very important relations that we, as France and as the
Security Council, have with the African Union, it is
obvious that it is entirely appropriate to give due
consideration to the statements by representatives of
the African Union. Given our long-standing friendly
relations with Commissioner Lamamra, we of course
do not want to keep him from speaking.

However, I must express publicly my reservations
concerning the motivation behind this decision. Those
reasons were made known to me, and it was with
reservations that I accepted the decision, which was
taken because of scheduling constraints on the part of
the Commissioner, who wished to address the Council
before leaving New York. Under these circumstances,
France will, of course, help the Commissioner address
the Council in the way that he has worked out.

However, if it is because this is a subject that
concerns the African Union that the floor will be given
to a regional organization before it is given to the
Security Council, I will have to express my very
serious reservations. That does not seem to be in
accordance with, in particular, the discussions that we
held in this very Chamber a few days ago on relations
between the African Union and the Security Council.

Once again, if it is a matter of scheduling
constraints, it is with great pleasure that I would wish
to help our friend Mr. Lamamra get out of this difficult
situation. Under those circumstances, we have no
objections.
