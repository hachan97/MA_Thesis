The President: Since this is perhaps one of
Ambassador Nambiar's final appearances before the
Security Council, may I, on behalf of the Council
members, address him and wish him all the best in his
future pursuits.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Costa Rica. I invite her to take a seat
at the Council table and to make her statement.
