Mr. Michon (France) (spoke in French): The
Security Council just adopted resolution 2418 (2018),
which renews the sanctions regime on South Sudan.
France voted in favour of the resolution, which should
help to put an end to the violence in South Sudan and to
advance the political process.

The international community and the Council
could not - cannot - remain impassive in the face
of the clashes on the ground in the past few months
and the continuous violations of human rights.
In that connection, we welcome the efforts of the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)
through the High-level Revitalization Forum to bring
the parties back together and find a political solution.
However, we regret that the parties did not seize upon
that opportunity to reach a political agreement that
would provide peace prospects for South Sudan and its
long-suffering people.

The parties must now take advantage of the coming
weeks to reach an adequate political agreement. Today's
resolution should make them aware of their responsibility
in that regard. The international community must stay
fully mobilized to promote favourable conditions for
peace and security in South Sudan. IGAD, the African
Union and regional and international partners, as well
as the Council, have a role to play. The coming weeks
will be pivotal for South Sudan.
