The President: I thank Mr. Sharma for those
concluding remarks. Once again, on behalf of the
Council, we wish him all the best in the future.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Council will remain seized of the matter.

The meeting rose at 1.20pm.
