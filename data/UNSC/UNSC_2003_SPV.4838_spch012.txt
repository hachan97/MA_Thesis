Mr. De La Sabliere (France) (spoke in French): I
should like to begin by thanking the President Meron,
President Mase, Ms. Del Ponte and Mr. J allow for their
interventions, which my delegation listened to most
attentively. Once again, we reiterate my country's
support for the two Tribunals.

Like previous speakers, the French delegation has
closely followed the implementation of the completion
strategy as developed by the two Tribunals and
supported by our Council, most recently in resolution
1503 (2003). It is, of course, clear that it is important
for all of the players involved - the organs of the two
Tribunals, the judges, the prosecutors, the registrars
and, above all, the States of the regions concerned -
to mobilize themselves with regard to arrests, transfers,
cooperation, witnesses and evidence. The international
community must assist and support competent national
jurisdictions in the delocalization of these matters.

I have two very brief questions to add to those that
have already been asked, addressed to President Meron
and to President Mose. I should like to ask them whether
they have planned or are planning specific mechanisms
to follow up on a regular basis the way in which the
completion strategy is being implemented in its
particulars. Are they planning, in particular, for the
establishment of warning criteria to address any
difficulties that may arise?
