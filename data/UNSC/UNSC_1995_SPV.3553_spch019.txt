MS. Cafias (Argentina) (interpretation from Spanish):
Argentina has witnessed the military advance by the
Bosnian Serb forces on the safe area of Srebrenica with
considerable concern. Faced with this very serious step in
the escalation of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
the Security Council could not remain impassive. For this
reason we support the resolution the Council has just
adopted. By sending this message, we wish to make it clear
that the Security Council is not ready to accept as a fait
accompli the taking of Srebrenica, and that it fully supports
the UNPROFOR forces in the field and their efforts to
relieve the critical plight of the civilian population in this
area. That population has once again been forced to seek a
new place of refuge, and their sufferings are a matter of
particularly grave concern.

My delegation categorically condemns the constraints
and the attacks to which UNPROFOR personnel have been
subjected and which have often resulted in their detention
or death. In this context, we wish to pay a particularly
warm tribute to the Dutch contingent for the extremely
good job it is doing in this very difficult situation. Together
with the other members of the Security Council, we call on
the Bosnian Serb forces to release immediately and
unconditionally all members of UNPROFOR still being
held.

Srebrenica should be restored to the status agreed to
by the parties in April 1993. For this reason, in the present
resolution the Council has requested the Secretary-General
to take the necessary steps to this end, and we urge all the
parties to cooperate in this respect. The leaders of both
parties must understand that a political solution is the only
option in this conflict. The suffering of their peoples and
the appeals of the international community should prompt
the parties to abandon the military option once and for all.
