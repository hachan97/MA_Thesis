Mr. Hickey (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom was pleased to vote in favour of resolution
2414 (2018), which we believe sends a strong signal
of the support from the Security Council in three key
areas - first, support for de-escalation; secondly,
support for the continuing work of the United Nations
Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara
(MINURSO); and, finally, supporting the overall goal
of progress towards a lasting and mutually acceptable
solution that provides for the self-determination of the
people of Western Sahara.

With that goal in mind, we encourage the parties
to engage now with a political process in a spirit of
realism and compromise. The six-month window
provided by the resolution is an opportunity and
an indication of the importance the international
community attaches to achieving progress. Another
indication is the appointment of the new Personal Envoy
of the Secretary-General, as well as the commitment
he has already shown, in his first months, to finding
a solution. The United Kingdom strongly supports the
efforts of Personal Envoy Kohler, as well as the work
of MINURSO and its new Head, Mr. Colin Stewart.
We call on all concerned to engage positively over the
coming months, in line with both the spirit and the
letter of resolution 2414 (2018).
