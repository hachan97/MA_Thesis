The President: I thank the Prime Minister of
Somalia for his kind words addressed to me.

I should now like to inform the Council that I
have received letters from the representatives of Iraq
and Kenya, in which they request to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Aldouri
(Iraq) and Mr. Jalang'o (Kenya) took the seats
reserved for them at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I received a letter dated 18 October 2001
from the Permanent Representative of Mali to the
United Nations, which reads as follows:

"I have the honour to request that the
Security Council extend an invitation under rule
39 of its provisional rules of procedure to His
Excellency Mr. Mokhtar Lamani, Permanent
Observer of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference to the United Nations, during the
Council's discussion of the item entitled "The

a"

situation in Somalia .

That letter will be published as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/2001/984.

I invite Mr. Mokhtar Lamani to take the seat
reserved for him at the side of the Council Chamber.
