The President: I have received letters from the
representatives of the Central African Republic and
Chad, requesting to participate in this meeting. I
propose to invite those representatives to participate in
this meeting without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

On behalf of the Security Council, I extend an
invitation under rule 39 of the Council's provisional
rules of procedure to Mr. Youssef Mahmoud, Special
Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of
the United Nations Mission in the Central African
Republic and Chad.

It is so decided.

Participants have before them document
S/2010/6l l, which contains the report of the Secretary-
General on the United Nations Mission in the Central
African Republic and Chad.

I now give the floor to Mr. Youssef Mahmoud.
