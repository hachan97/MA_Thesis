Mr. Cherif (Chad) (spoke in French): I would
like to thank the Chair of the Committee established
pursuant to resolution 1737 (2006), Ambassador Gary
Quinlan, for his quarterly report on the activities of the
Committee for the period of 25 June to 12 September.

Chad takes note of the quarterly report and
encourages the Committee to continue its work,
including the consideration of the recommendations
of the report of the Panel of Experts (S/2014/394, annex). Chad also encourages the Committee to
continue its interaction with Member States to provide
them with guidelines on Security Council measures.
Finally, we encourage the Committee to continue
its communication with the Islamic Republic of Iran
concerning the incident of 31 March.
