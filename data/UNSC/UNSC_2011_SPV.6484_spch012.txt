Mr. Onemola (Nigeria): This Council has
consistently expressed concern over the situation in the
Middle East, including the continued Israeli settlement
activities in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. This
issue is of serious concern to my delegation because of
its implication for peace and security in the region. We
view the cessation of settlement activities as a
confidence-building measure with the potential to
return the parties to the negotiating table. We therefore
felt constrained to vote in favour of the draft
resolution, and we regret that it was not adopted.

We reiterate that it is time for the parties to this
dispute to demonstrate their undivided commitment to
peace. They should remove all obstacles to the
resumption of direct negotiations to resolve persistent
permanent status issues. The Council, for its part,
should continue its supporting role in the peace
process, fostering security and stability within the
occupied Palestinian territory.

For our part, we shall remain firmly committed to
the goal of seeing a secure State of Israel living side by
side in peace and security with an independent State of
Palestine with recognized borders.

While peace in the Middle East is attainable, it
must come on the back of sustained political will and
commitment. The Middle East needs peace. The world
needs peace.
