Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation voted in favour
of resolution 2124 (2013), which was prepared by
the delegation of the United Kingdom. We did so in
support of the efforts of the African Union to promote
a settlement in Somalia on the basis of the key role
that the African Union Mission in Somalia plays in
resolving the situation in that country. However, we
cannot fail to point out that some of our concerns were
not appropriately borne in mind by the drafters of the
resolution during the work on the text.

In particular, we are seriously concerned about
paragraph 21, which refers to the requirement on
the Somali Government to provide full access to
humanitarian organizations in the country. That
requirement runs counter to what the General Assembly
has established concerning the principles on the
provision of emergency humanitarian assistance. That
is odd, given that the Federal Government of Somalia is
simply not in a position to control a significant part of
the country's territory.

It is clear that international humanitarian
organizations are leaving Somalia or do not go to work
there - not because they are hindered from doing so,
which could be attributed to the Somali Government,
but because of the underlying security situation. In
trying to establish humanitarian principles, the Council
is delving into an area outside its remit, namely, the
standards-setting work of the General Assembly. In
that regard, we would like to underscore that we do
not consider the wording of paragraph 21 as setting a
precedent.
