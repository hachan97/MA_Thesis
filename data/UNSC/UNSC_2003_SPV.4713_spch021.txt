Mr. Dahlgren (Sweden): I would like to make
just three brief points. First, I would like to express my
gratitude for the kind words expressed to my
Government for the part that it - together with many
others - has played in this project.

Secondly, I am of course heartened by the support
expressed in the Council for many of the proposals in
the Stockholm report. That goes both for the clear
willingness of the Secretariat, as explained by
Assistant Secretary-General Tiirk, to play a more active
role in improving coordination and monitoring, and for
all those members of the Council that have endorsed an
improvement in the implementation of targeted
sanctions. We look forward to turning some of those
ideas into reality.

Thirdly, I agree with Jeremy Greenstock about
the lessons that sanctions committees can learn from
the Counter-Terrorism Committee with regard to the
transparency that that Committee displayed, its
effectiveness and, perhaps even more important, its
relationships with Member States.

The commitment that has been expressed by so
many Council members this morning for improving
targeted sanctions is, of course, very positive. But with
all due respect, that is not enough. As several speakers
have underlined this morning, there must be universal
support for targeted sanctions if they are to be
successful. Each Member State must do its share. I
think that we in the Stockholm Process have an
additional task in that important effort: to make those
guidelines known, not only in this Chamber in this city,
but in capitals all over the world, and, perhaps, to use
the resources that may be available to promote an
understanding of the need to ensure not only the
implementation of more effective targeted sanctions,
but also the means to do so.
