Mr. Zhao Yong (China) (spoke in Chinese): I thank
Ambassador Ramirez Carrefio for his briefing and
appreciate the active the work of the Committee pursuant
to resolutions 751 (1992) and 1907 (2009) concerning
Somalia and Eritrea, under his able leadership.

Recently, Somalia's political process has made
progress. Efforts aimed at building a federal system
are proceeding steadily, and economic and social
development is gradually being restored, which China
welcomes. China believes that, with the help of the
international community, the Somali Government and
people will attain greater achievements on the path to
peaceful reconstruction. China maintains that sanctions
are not the end, just the means. Council sanctions
against Somalia and Eritrea should contribute to
promoting peace and stability in Somalia and the Horn
of Africa, as well as to the counter-terrorism efforts of
the Somali National Army and the African Union.

The final report of the Monitoring Group issued in
October (see S/2015/802) found no evidence of support
to Al-Shabaab by the Eritrean Government. In the light
of the changes in the situation, the Council should make
the corresponding adjustments to the relevant sanctions
regime.
