Mr. Burian (Slovakia): Slovakia too voted in
favour of the technical resolution extending the
mandate of the United Nations Mission for the
Referendum in Western Sahara for six more months.
We hope that this period will be used to resume
dialogue between the parties to find a final solution to
the issue of Western Sahara based on direct
negotiations. We also agree that adequate attention
should be paid to the human rights situation in the area.
