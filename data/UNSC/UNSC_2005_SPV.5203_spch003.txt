The President (spoke in French): I thank
Mr. Zacklin for his comprehensive briefing.

As there is no list of speakers for the Council
members, I should like to invite them to indicate to the
Secretariat if they wish to take the floor.

I now give the floor to Mr. Didace Kiganahe,
Minister of Justice of Burundi.
