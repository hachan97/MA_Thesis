The President (spoke in French): In accordance
with rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure, I invite the representative of South Sudan to
participate in this meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

After consultations among Council members, I
have been authorized to make the following statement
on their behalf:

"The Security Council underscores the
seriousness and urgency of the situation in South
Sudan, as demonstrated by its 3 March 2015
unanimous adoption of resolution 2206 (2015)
establishing a United Nations sanctions regime
for those undermining the peace, security or
stability of South Sudan, with initial dates for
the Council's review of 5 March 2015 and 1 April
2015, and demanding that the parties commit to
finding a comprehensive agreement and calling
upon all parties to armed conflict in South Sudan
to issue clear orders prohibiting all violations of
international humanitarian law and human rights
violations and abuses Without further delay.

"In that regard, the Security Council expresses
its profound disappointment that President Salva
Kiir, former Vice-President Riek Machar and all
parties have failed to conclude an agreement on the
transitional arrangements outlined in the 1 February
2015 Areas of Agreement on the Establishment of
the Transitional Government of National Unity
in the Republic of South Sudan signed by the
Republic of South Sudan and the Sudan People's
Liberation Movement/Army in Opposition by the
5 March 2015 deadline set by the Intergovernmental
Authority on Development (IGAD). In this context,
the Security Council reiterates its willingness to
impose sanctions against those who threaten the
peace, security or stability of South Sudan.

"The Security Council reiterates its strong

condemnation of the repeated violations of the
Cessation of Hostilities Agreement accepted and
signed by the Republic of South Sudan and the
Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army in
Opposition on 23 January 2014, and emphasizes
that the actions of President Salva Kiir and former
Vice-President Rick Machar in continuing to
pursue a military solution to this conflict are in
breach of their obligations under that Agreement.

"The Security Council commends IGAD, as
supported by the United Nations and African Union,
for its relentless work in establishing a forum for
political and security dialogue, establishing and
operationalizing the Monitoring and Verification
Mechanism for the Cessation of Hostilities
Agreement and leading multi-stakeholder political
negotiations to establish a Transitional Government
of National Unity.

"The Security Council takes note ofthe 6 March
2015 message from Ethiopia's Prime Minister and
Chairman of IGAD Hailemariam Dessalegn to the
people of South Sudan explaining why the peace
talks did not produce the necessary breakthrough.

"The Security Council welcomes IGAD's
intention, joined by the friends of South Sudan
from Africa and abroad, including the United
Nations, to implement a common plan and to table
a reasonable and comprehensive solution to end
the crisis in South Sudan and urges all parties to
engage meaningfully in the peace process so to
bring about a political resolution of the crisis and
an end to the violence.

"The Security Council reiterates its intent
to impose any sanctions that may be appropriate
to respond to the situation, which may include
an arms embargo and the designation of senior
individuals responsible for actions or policies that
threaten the peace, security or stability of South
Sudan, so as to encourage the Government of South
Sudan and opposition forces to form a Transitional
Government of National Unity, take effective and
comprehensive steps to cause forces under direct or
indirect control to cease military operations, acts
of Violence, as well as violations of human rights,
and enable full access for humanitarian assistance.

"The Security Council renews its deep
appreciation for the courageous actions taken and
ongoing by the United Nations Mission in the
Republic of South Sudan (UNMISS) personnel
and troop- and police-contributing countries for
the protection of civilians and the stabilization of
the security situation, and reiterates its support to
UNMISS.

"The Security Council reaffirms its deep
concern that the conflict has resulted in great
human suffering, including significant loss of life,
displacement of 2 million people, and the loss of
property, further impoverishing and disadvantaging
the people of South Sudan.

"The Security Council further underscores
the significant importance of fighting impunity
and ensuring accountability for serious violations
and abuses of human rights and violations of
international humanitarian law in South Sudan
including those that may amount to war crimes and
crimes against humanity.

"The Security Council renews its calls for
parties to the conflict to allow and facilitate,
in accordance with relevant provisions of
international law and United Nations guiding
principles of humanitarian assistance, the full, safe
and unhindered access of humanitarian personnel,
equipment and supplies to all those in need and
timely delivery of humanitarian assistance.

"The Security Council recognizes the work of
the African Union Commission of Inquiry for South
Sudan in investigating and documenting violations
as well as abuses of international human rights law
and international humanitarian law, anticipates
with interest its findings and recommendations,
encourages the public release of the final report
as soon as possible, and welcomes the further
engagement of the African Union to ensure
justice and accountability, as well as healing and
reconciliation.

"The Security Council looks forward to the
rapid establishment of the Panel of Experts that
will play a central role in assisting the South Sudan
Sanctions Committee established under resolution
2206 (2015), including by providing it with
information relevant to the potential designation of
individuals and entities who may be engaging in
the activities described in paragraphs 6 and 7 of
resolution 2206 (2015).

"The Security Council reaffirms that
it shall be prepared to adjust the measures
contained in resolution 2206 (2015), including by
strengthening through additional measures, as
well as modification, suspension or lifting of the
measures, as may be needed at any time in light of
the progress achieved in the peace, accountability
and reconciliation process, and in light of the
implementation of the parties' commitments,
including the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement
and other obligations specified in the preamble of
the resolution, and compliance with it.

"The Security Council further reaffirms its
support for the people of South Sudan, renews its
steadfast commitment to the peace and security
of South Sudan and the region, including through
its full implementation of resolution 2206 (2015),
and echoes the IGAD Chairman's 6 March 2015
statement that the world stands with the people and
peace will be achieved."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/20lS/9.

I now give the floor to the representative of South
Sudan.
