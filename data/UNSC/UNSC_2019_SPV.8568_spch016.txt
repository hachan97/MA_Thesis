and its secretariat for all their support to us this month.
It has indeed been a busy and special month, during
which we achieved consensus on several important
issues before us. We could not have done it alone or
without the hard work, unlimited support and positive
contributions of every delegation in the Council, as

officers of the conference services, interpreters,
translators, verbatim reporters and security staff.

success to the delegation of Peru in presiding over the
Council for the month of July. In addition, given that
