Mr. Dabbashi (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in Arabic): We followed closely the consultations that
took place over the past few days in the Group of
Friends of Georgia, and we regret that these
consultations were not able to lead to a formula that
took into consideration the positions of all parties. This
prevented the Security Council from adopting this draft
resolution.

We think that it is vital to have a peacekeeping
mission in the region, but any activity on the part of
the United Nations must have the agreement of all
parties of the United Nations. This presence must be
one of credibility and must help promote peace and
security. Since there was no agreement among the
parties concerned, my delegation abstained on the vote.

Despite all that, my delegation reaffirms here that
we appreciate the role that has been played by the
personnel and blue helmets of the United Nations in
the region, and in the end, we would call on all parties
concerned not to increase tensions and to focus all
necessary efforts on maintaining peace and security in
the region, whether or not there is a United Nations
presence there.
