Mr. Aldahhak (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): I will be brief, but I would nevertheless like to
respond to the statement made by the representative of
Israel who just took the floor. I would simply say that the
Middle East region has known terrorism only since the
Israeli occupation, which in the 1940s brought with it
terrorist organizations that began to perpetrate terrorist
attacks against the Arab inhabitants of the occupied
Arab territories of Palestine, Syria and Lebanon. Those
crimes spread to other regions of the world after that.
