Mr. Tumysh (Kazakhstan): Kazakhstan welcomes
the adoption today of resolution 2337 (2017), on the
situation in The Gambia. We thank Senegal for its
efforts to find consensus on the resolution. Kazakhstan
commends the tireless mediation efforts of the
Presidents of Nigeria, Liberia, Ghana and Mauritania,
as well as the African Union, the Economic Community
of West African States and other stakeholders.
Kazakhstan voted in favour of resolution 2337 (2017)
for the following reasons.

First, we believe that it is important to respect
the will of the people of The Gambia, as expressed
in the result of the election last month. Kazakhstan
is committed to peace and long-term stability in The
Gambia so that its people can freely enjoy their rights
and freedoms.

Secondly, the Security Council should seize the
opportunity to send a clear message to the Government
and people of The Gambia, as well as to the international
community, that the United Nations is closely engaged
and requests all stakeholders, including the Gambian
defence and security forces, to exercise restraint.
That message is also to encourage all stakeholders to
prevent any steps that could lead to possible violence
in the country.

Finally, with this resolution we call for a
demonstration of wisdom, responsibility and political
will to effectively resolve the current crisis and ensure
the peaceful and orderly transfer of power to President
Adama Barrow.
