Mrs. Khoudaverdian (Armenia): I regret to be
taking the floor a second time. What I would suggest
is that instead of making fitful attempts to mislead
Member States and abuse the time allocated for this
debate, we suggest that the delegation of Azerbaijan
abandon its irresponsible means of propaganda
and try to explain to its Foreign Ministry and its
leadership that this Organization is much more suited
to serious deliberations on issues related to multilateral
cooperation.
