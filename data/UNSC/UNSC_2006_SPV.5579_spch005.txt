The President (spoke in Arabic): I will now
speak in my national capacity in explanation of vote.

The State of Qatar has voted in favour of the
resolution out of our belief in the need to respect the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Somalia, as well
as its political independence and the unity of its
territory. In the consultations that were held over the
resolution, we affirmed our readiness to undertake any
measures as long as they will genuinely contribute to
easing the intensity of the crisis in Somalia.

Therefore, we have reaffirmed the need to
continue to deal with the situation in Somalia
cautiously and without rushing to any preconceived
judgement. Our main purpose is to spread peace and
stability in Somalia and to entrench a cooperative and
comprehensive national rule.

Our support for the resolution stems from our
understanding that it aims to encourage all Somali
parties to reach a peaceful political settlement through
a comprehensive dialogue among all groups. This
would accomplish the hoped-for stability. It is
important that this resolution not have a negative
impact; it must not be construed as being directed at
one party at the expense of another. This must be kept
in mind when the resolution is implemented.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Council will remain seized of the matter.

The meeting rose at 4.35 p.m.
