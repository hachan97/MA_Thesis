The President: I shall now make a statement in
my capacity as the representative of Ghana.

My delegation is also grateful to the Secretary-
General for his statement. I also wish to reiterate
Ghana's confidence in his good offices in Myanmar.
We strongly support his positive interventions in the
situation in that country, both directly and through the
Special Envoy, Mr. Gambari. Let me also express our
thanks for the briefing provided by Mr. Gambari on his
latest mission to Myanmar, which elicited intense
interest around the globe - and rightly so - because
the situation in Myanmar is a matter of concern to us
all.

Given the circumstances in which the visit was
undertaken, we think that Mr. Gambari deserves
commendation for engaging with both the authorities
of Myanmar and their opponents, as well as with
regional leaders, particularly of countries of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
That underscores the continuing importance of the role
of the Special Envoy as a vital link, not only between
the Government and the people of Myanmar, but also
with the international community at large.

We believe that recent events in the country have
introduced a new dynamic in the political situation and
we are convinced that the long-term peace and stability
of the country depends on the fulfilment of the
legitimate aspirations of the people of Myanmar for
democracy and for a better quality of life. The
contribution of the Special Envoy in that regard is of
utmost importance.

I shall now resume my functions as President of
the Council. I shall now give the floor to the
representative of Myanmar.
