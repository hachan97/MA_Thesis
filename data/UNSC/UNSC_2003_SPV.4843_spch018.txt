The President: I shall now make a statement in
my capacity as the representative of the United States.

I, too, want to thank Ambassador Sharma for
joining us today. We are pleased with the success of the
United Nations Mission of Support in (UNMISET), in
East Timor, for which a number of dedicated
individuals deserve credit, including, of course,
Ambassador Sharma, his colleagues and the late Sergio
Vieira de Mello.

We applaud the Government and people of East
Timor for their progress towards the development of
the country's political institutions and of good
diplomatic relations with neighbouring countries and
those beyond the region.

We call on donors to continue to support progress
in East Timor, particularly through the provision of
bilaterally funded advisers to fill remaining vacancies.
We also call on the Government of East Timor to do its
part to nurture respect for the rule of law, address
allegations of police brutality and adopt the legal
frameworks for civil administration recommended by
Ambassador Sharma.

UNMISET's mandate will end in May 2004. We
concur with the suggestion in the Secretary-General's
report of 6 October that the international community
should begin considering the best means by which the
needs of the country can be met after UNMISET's
withdrawal. We stand ready to participate in this
discussion along with our Council partners as well as
other interested countries, including Australia, New
Zealand, Portugal and Japan.

We agree that the international community should
remain engaged in ensuring the establishment of
security and stability in East Timor after May. We
welcome the initiative of the Australian Government in
offering proposals for how this engagement might
continue. We also look forward to seeing the
Secretariat's further suggestions, as promised in the 6
October report.

I now resume my function as President of the
Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Timor-
Leste.
