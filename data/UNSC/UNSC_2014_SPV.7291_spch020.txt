Mr. Laro (Nigeria): I also wish to thank Under-
Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing.

The recent announcement by the Government of
Israel of plans to build new settlements in occupied
East Jerusalem has grave implications for the Israeli-
Palestinian peace process. The immediate cessation of
illegal Israeli settlement activity is crucial to resolving
the question of Palestine, based on the two-State
solution, which the international community broadly
supports and for which there is no viable alternative.
We therefore join other members of the Council in
ordering the Israeli Government to abandon its plans
to construct new settlements in East Jerusalem, which
under international law is a part of occupied Palestinian
territory.

During the Security Council debate of 21 October
(see S/PV.7281), we called on both parties to seize
the opportunity provided by the current ceasefire to
restart the stalled negotiations. We restate our position
that dialogue remains the only means of resolving
the question of Palestine. The parties should avoid
hostile rhetoric and unilateral actions and take steps
to de-escalate tensions. They should, without delay,
resume direct negotiations on the final status issues,
including on borders, security, the status of Jerusalem
and the return of Palestinian refugees.

Our unambiguous message today, as always, is
that we would like to see Israel and Palestine live side
by side in peace and security, within internationally
recognized borders and consistent with the relevant
Security Council resolutions.
