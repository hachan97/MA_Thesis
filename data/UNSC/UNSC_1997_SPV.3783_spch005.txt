Mr. Richardson (United States of America): The
United States welcomes the extension of the mandate of
the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force
(UNPREDEP) for a further six months, until 30
November 1997. We believe that UNPREDEP plays an
important and highly effective role in promoting stability
in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The crisis
in Albania has heightened the need for UNPREDEP'S
continuation, but in our View there are other sources of
instability and tension in the region which also reinforce
the importance of UNPREDEP now. We fully support a

 

message of sustained, undiminished international
commitment to UNPREDEP and the region.

This resolution to renew UNPREDEP is the product of
the considered recommendations of the Secretary-General
and candid discussion among members of the Council. It
represents a decision on the part of the Council to proceed
with a course of action which we all believe is ultimately
in the best interests of the region, despite any differences
among us on specific ways in which this may be most
effectively achieved. Objectivity and a spirit of cooperation
and compromise have prevailed in the Council on this
issue. We believe this resolution will strengthen
UNPREDEP's ability to carry out its difficult mission and
enhance our collective efforts in the region.
