The United States thanks fellow Council members for demonstrating their ongoing support to the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA). We would also like to extend particular thanks to Ethiopia for its contributions to UNISFA. As both the Sudan and South Sudan respond to coronavirus disease and engage in their own political transitions, the people of Abyei must not be forgotten. They deserve to live peacefully, without fear of attack or intimidation. Abyei's women in particular should be supported to fully, effectively and meaningfully participate in discussions about their own security and future. Reports of violence and tensions in Abyei are disturbing, and the continued loss of life remains unacceptable. We call for restraint from the local communities and dialogue and look to the Sudan and South Sudan to deliver on establishing temporary security and administrative arrangements that can provide a framework for lasting peace in this sensitive area. That step is critical to supporting long-term peace efforts in both South Sudan and the Sudan and in the broader region. With this renewed mandate, the Security Council reiterates that the Sudan and South Sudan should remove all obstacles to the implementation of UNISFA's mandate, including by allowing the deployment of UNISFA personnel to improve the protection of civilians. We also reiterate our call for senior United Nations officials and the African Union to step up their engagement with the Sudan and South Sudan in order to maintain momentum towards resolving Abyei's status and ensuring UNISFA can fully implement its mandate. The United States remains committed to supporting peace and security in Abyei and in the Sudan and South Sudan.
