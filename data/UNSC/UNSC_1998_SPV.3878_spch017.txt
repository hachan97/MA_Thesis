Mr. Shen Guofang (China) (interpretation from Chinese): China has always attached great importance to
humanitarian questions in the territory of the former
Yugoslavia, and it always opposes actions violating
international humanitarian law. On the basis of this political
consideration, China voted in favour of Security Council
resolution 827 (1993) on the establishment of the
International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.

We note that, since its establishment, the Tribunal,
thanks to the cooperation of all sides concerned, has made
earnest efforts and certain achievements. In particular,
recently all sides concerned have been cooperating even
more actively with the Tribunal. We encourage the
continuation of this cooperation so that the Tribunal can
complete its work as early as possible, in accordance with
the provisions of the Council resolution.

We appreciate the efforts made by the Tribunal to
improve its efficiency, and we understand the difficulties
it faces. We hope that the decision to be taken by the
Security Council today will help speed up the work of the
Tribunal. In view of the current requests and needs of the
Tribunal and of the requests of all sides concerned, China
will vote in favour of the draft resolution before us.

However, we wish to express our reservation about
invoking Chapter VII of the Charter in the draft
resolution. When the Security Council was adopting
resolution 827 (1993) we expressed a similar reservation.
Over the last five years the situation in the territory of the
former Yugoslavia has undergone tremendous changes.
This makes it even less appropriate to invoke Chapter VII
now.
