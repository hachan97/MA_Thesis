Mr. Toure (Mali) (spoke in French): Like
previous speakers, I should first of all like to thank Mr.
Guehenno for his update on the situation in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. My delegation hails to and supports the
commendable efforts of the High Representative to
implement the Dayton Peace Accords. We call on the
parties to abide strictly by the Accords. We welcome
the holding, on 11 November, of the third general
elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This
development of the situation in Bosnia and
Herzegovina bodes well for economic reform and
national reconciliation. We should like to pay a well-
deserved tribute to the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe for organizing the elections and
to the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.

Finally, the Council must follow the situation in
Bosnia and Herzegovina very closely so as to promote
peaceful coexistence in that country.
