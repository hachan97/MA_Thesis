Mr. Sergeyev (Ukraine): I too do not want to
continue this dialogue because it is going nowhere. I
would just remind our Russian colleague, citing one of
the most famous Russian writers, Turgenev:

(spoke in Russian)

"There is one truth for everyone. Everyone has
their own truth, but there is only one real truth."

(spoke in English)

The problem is that the Russian representative
quoted two advisers to somebody, and raised the
issue of trust. I do not have the quotation, but all of us
remember that three or four times the Russian President
promised the world community - the last time it was a
decision * to withdraw those troops. That is why they
are worrying about what is going on. We are worrying
about where the armaments are coming from - from
the regular Russian army or from somebody else
in Russia? That is the question. I am asking about
the position of the Russian leadership. Why, despite
the promises, are huge amounts of armaments and
personnel - around 49,000 people - still positioned
along the Ukrainian border? This is about trust. How
can we come back if we have lost confidence, if the
Russian leadership - not our adviser to somebody,
stating something - promised and and yet has failed
to deliver?

I will give the Council the figures. They are not
secret because they come from different sources.
Council members may brief their colleagues in any
format convenient to them, but that is what we have
from a variety of sources. The OSCE keeps demanding,
under agreements to which the Russian Federation is
party, information concerning those flanks, limits and
excercises which Russia is obligated to report. What are
the troops doing? They have been carrying out exercises
since February or March, without explanation. That is
about trust.
