Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 2433
(2018), which demonstrates the Security Council's
important support for the work of the United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).

China acknowledges that UNIFIL continus to
effectively fulfil its mandate and is making an important
contribution to maintaining overall calm and stability
in its area of operation. We commend the cooperation
provided by the host country in the performance of
UNIFIL's tasks, as well as the hard work by troop-
contributing countries and all peacekeepers.

The Security Council's extension of UNIFIL's
mandate for an additional year is conducive to
maintaining stability in southern Lebanon and
contributes to further implementing resolution 1701
(2006). The Council and the international community
should continue to provide political support to UNIFIL,
as well as the necessary resources, so as to ensure that
it has the capacity to perform its duties.
