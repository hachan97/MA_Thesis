Mr. Kone (spoke in French): On behalfoer. Marcel
Alain de Souza, President of the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS) Commission, who
wishes he could have attended this meeting but was
held up in Africa due to prior engagements that are
equally important to our Community's progress, I
offer our apologies for his absence. I also convey our
thanks for the invitation to participate in this important
debate with the theme of peacekeeping operations
facing asymmetric threats. Likewise, I thank all of
the briefers that spoke this morning for the clarity of
their presentations.

ECOWAS takes this opportunity to warmly
congratulate the Senegalese delegation on assuming the
presidency of the Security Council for November, just
a few weeks before the international forum in Dakar
on peace and security in Africa - an event that will
enable us to exchange views on commitments in the
region and find some clues as to how to definitively
steer our region away from potential danger. That is why
ECOWAS views that meeting as part of the concrete
implementation of the new vision that all stakeholders
could share in their response to asymmetrical challenges
and threats in peacekeeping operations. ECOWAS
fully backs that vision and intends to play its rightful
role, as it has always done, for peacebuilding and good
governance in our area.
