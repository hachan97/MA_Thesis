Ms. Rice (United States of America): We will
make our formal statement in consultations. I just want
to say that, while we certainly respect any member's
right to speak in the Chamber and say what they think,
we think the better part of wisdom is to focus on the
goal we all share, which is achieving a genuine two-
State solution. A rhetorical display designed to enflame
is not necessarily a constructive way to advance that
goal. The United States remains fully committed to
achieving a negotiated solution to the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict, and we hope and expect that our
colleagues on the Security Council will continue to be
supportive in that endeavour.
