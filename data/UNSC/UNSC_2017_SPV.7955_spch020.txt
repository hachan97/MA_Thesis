The President (spoke in Spanish): There are no
more names inscribed on the list of speakers.

Since this is the final meeting under the Uruguayan
presidency of the Security Council, I would first like
to thank my colleagues at the Permanent Mission of
Uruguay to the United Nations. Without their support,
we would not have been able to achieve so much
during our presidency. It is the unseen workers at
the permanent missions who make it possible for the
Permanent Representatives and the Deputy Permanent
Representatives to conduct their work. They provide
much needed support, day after day, throughout the year,
but in particular when a country holds the presidency
of the Council. I sincerely thank and acknowledge
them all.
Secondly, I would like to thank all of the Permanent
Representatives present and their delegations for
having made our work as easy as possible this month.
I would also like to thank the Council secretariat for
the technical and organizational support they continue
to provide. I also thank the security personnel, whom
we do not see but who nonetheless are part of our work.
I would like to thank the sound engineers and all of
the staff working in the Chamber and the consultations
room. Last but far from least, I would like to thank
our interpreters and translators, who are absolutely
indispensable to our work.

I know that I speak on behalf of the entire Security
Council in wishing the best of luck to the Plurinational
State of Bolivia when it assumes the presidency of the
Council in June.

I now invite Council members to informal
consultations to continue our discussion on the subject.

The meeting rose at 5.05 pm.
