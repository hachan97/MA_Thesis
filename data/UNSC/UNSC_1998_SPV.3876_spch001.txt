The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of
Angola, in which he requests to be invited to participate in
the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Carneiro
(Angola) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: On behalf of the Council, I welcome
the Vice-Minister of Territorial Administration of Angola,
General Higino Carneiro.

The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Observer
Mission in Angola (MONUA), document S/1998/333.
Members of the Council also have before them document
S/ 1998/349, which contains the text of a draft resolution
prepared in the course of the Council's prior consultations.

The first speaker on my list is the Vice-Minister of
Territorial Administration of Angola, General Higino
Carneiro, to whom I give the floor.
