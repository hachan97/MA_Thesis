The President: Before giving the floor to the
next speaker, allow me, due to the late hour, appeal to
all members to be as brief as possible in their
statements because I think it is in everybody's interest
that we still have enough time at the conclusion of the
meeting to give the floor to our guest speakers to
respond to comments and possible questions.
