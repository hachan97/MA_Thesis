Mr. Laro (Nigeria): I thank Special Representative
of the Secretary-General Zarif for his comprehensive
update on Kosovo. I also thank His Excellency
Mr. Dacie, First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister
for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Serbia, and
Mr. Hashim Thaci for their statements.

The resumption of high-level meetings between
Belgrade and Pristina within the context of the European
Union-facilitated dialogue is a significant development.
We encourage both sides to consolidate the gains
made in the renewed dialogue by implementing the
outstanding provisions of the April 2015 agreement on
the normalization of relations.

On counter-terrorism, Nigeria commends the
Kosovo authorities for the promulgation of a law
prohibiting individuals in Kosovo from joining armed
conflicts abroad. We welcome the establishment of an
inter-agency task force to prevent violent extremism
and radicalization. We encourage the authorities to
ensure the early operationalization of the task force.

Nigeria welcomes the progress made in promoting
voluntary returns to Kosovo. In particular, we
acknowledge the important role of the European Union
in providing housing for returnees. That is a vital step
in helping them to reintegrate. We are concerned about
the large number of cases pertaining to properties
belonging to Kosovo Serbs that are being illegally
occupied by Kosovo Albanians. It is important that
the property rights of Kosovo Serbs are respected
and upheld by the courts. We believe that that would
help to facilitate their voluntary return and improve
inter-community relations in Kosovo.

We take this opportunity to pay tribute to Special
Representative of the Secretary-General Zarif for
his astute leadership of the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo. We assure him of
Nigeria's full support in the execution of his mandate.
