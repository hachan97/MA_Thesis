Mr. Delattre (France) (spoke in French): France
welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 2323
(2016), regardless of nuanced positions. The vote
illustrates the unity of the Security Council in support of
the United Nations process. I warmly thank the British
penholder for his efforts in ensuring the adoption of
the resolution, which extends the mandate of the United
Nations Support Mission in Libya until September
next year. The decision to extend the mandate by nine
months sends a message of continued support to the
Mission. Reviewing the mandate will be possible if
need be during the year, and a strategic review should
be conducted quickly.

The resolution reiterates its support for the full
implementation of the Libyan Political Agreement.
It encourages the Government of National Accord
to make further progress, and in particular to build
on progress that has already been made to establish
a presidential guard. It expresses the Council's full

support to the Vienna communique and provides useful
clarifications on the Mission's mandate, which should
all be welcomed. The extension of the mandate is also
an opportunity to reiterate our full support to Prime

Minister Fayez Serraj and his Government.

In conclusion, I would like to reiterate France's full

support to United Nations efforts on this issue.
