The President: I think that shows that we have
now earned it.

I again thank Mr. Klein very much. I think his
comments are very much appreciated. I have seen that
paper in the folder and I believe it will be very useful
to the Council.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. We will be coming back later in the month to
adopt a draft resolution on the continuation of the
mandate of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.

The Council will remain seized of the matter.

The meeting rose at 12.50 p.m.
