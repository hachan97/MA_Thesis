The President (spoke in Chinese): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Haiti, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Cazeau
(Haiti), took a seat at the Council table.

The President (spoke in Chinese): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Hedi Annabi,
Special Representative of the Secretary-General and
head of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in
Haiti.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Annabi to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/5 86, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the United Nations Stabilization
Mission in Haiti.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Hedi Annabi, Special Representative of
2
the Secretary-General and head of the United Nations
Stabilization Mission in Haiti. I now give him the floor.
