Mr. Ja'afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): I regret having to take the floor for a second
time. I will be brief. I would like to say that I too
presented irrefutable facts. We are perfectly open to
hearing any explanation that might contradict what I
have stated. We do not wish to harm the reputation of the
United Nations, as we are one of its founding Member
States. I am here as a representative of that Member
State. We are proud of having been a founding Member
State and have always tirelessly defended the United
Nations. However, the Organization is not composed
exclusively of angels; I wish to combat its demons.

The representative of the United States remarked
that I did not refer to the report of the Secretary-General
(S/2016/460), but that is inaccurate. Everything I said
was with respect to that report. We are not levelling
accusations; rather, we are calling the attention of
Council members to problems related to humanitarian
assistance. On several occasions, we have said that
Turkey is using United Nations corridors to move
weapons. Mr. O'Brien and his colleagues have not
responded to that statement.

A few days ago, it was revealed that the Erdogan
regime was sending weapons along the corridors.
He has imprisoned customs officers, journalists and
judges. If that was an attack on the United Nations,
it would mean that the information about Turkey was
false, and that the statement made by the Ambassador
of the United States proves that it did not occur.

We are familiar with the cases of Libya and Iraq,
and I do not want to add Africa to that. Everyone knows
what is going in Africa. We want the work ofthe United
Nations to reflect its Charter. We do not want a new
Charter, casually rewritten according to new rules.
We must defend the dignity and sovereignty of States,
not the attacks that are constantly being made on that
dignity and sovereignty, and we must aid their citizens.
