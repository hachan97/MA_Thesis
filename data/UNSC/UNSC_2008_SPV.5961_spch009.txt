Mr. Mantovani (Italy): This is a time of great
and deep concern over the continued instability in and
around Georgia. We are convinced that the Security
Council cannot delay its action any longer. We do have
in place a ceasefire agreement accepted by the parties
and endorsed by the main international players,
including the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the
European Union. Now, we expect the full, immediate
and visible implementation of this agreement.

The draft resolution introduced by France aims at
nothing more than this, without blaming any particular
side for the current apparent stalemate. Moreover, we
cannot fail to reiterate our commitment to the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia, which
is being called into question.

Obviously, there are other dimensions of this
crisis which are of equal concern to us, including the
impact on other countries of the region and the
worrisome humanitarian situation. Yet it is now time to
focus on the most immediate goals. The adoption of the
draft resolution before us would be a first essential step
towards a comprehensive settlement of the current
cr1s1s.

I would like to conclude by confirming that Italy
is ready and willing to contribute to the increase of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) monitors contingent as decided in Vienna
earlier today. This additional effort would complement
ongoing initiatives in the area of humanitarian
assistance.
