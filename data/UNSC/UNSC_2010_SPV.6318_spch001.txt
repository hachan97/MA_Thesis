The President (spoke in Arabic): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Ibrahim Gambari,
Joint Special Representative for the African Union and
the United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Gambari to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of members to
the report of the Secretary-General on the African
Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur
(8/2010/213).

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Ibrahim Gambari.

I now give the floor to Mr. Gambari.
