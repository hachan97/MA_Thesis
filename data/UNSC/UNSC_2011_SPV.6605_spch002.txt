Mr. Salam (Lebanon): I would like to take this
opportunity to express our deep appreciation for the
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL),
and its leadership and members, women and men, for
their dedication and services. Lebanon commends the
efforts and sacrifices of the UNIFIL forces operating in
2

southern Lebanon and expresses its appreciation to all
troop-contributing countries, many of which are
represented around this table, including the presidency.
It attaches great importance to strengthening
coordination and cooperation with UNIFIL in
accordance with the agreed rules of engagement in
order to ensure the proper implementation of the
mission entrusted to it. Lebanon would also like to
reiterate its commitment to the implementation of
resolution 1701 (2006) in its entirety.
