Prince Zeid Ra'ad Zeid Al-Hussein (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): As the Security Council meets to
discuss the grave crime committed by Israel under the
direct supervision of its highest government authorities
against Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in Gaza yesterday, I
would like to express my Government's strong
condemnation of that assassination. That act makes
clear the brutal nature of Israel's policy of organized
assassinations and extrajudicial killings. That murder
will lead only to an escalation of violence and to the
deterioration of conditions in the occupied Palestinian
territories. Furthermore, it is a threat to the security and
stability of the region as a whole.

We call upon Israel to cease its inflammatory
policies and to work to achieve calm and to maintain
stability. At the same time, we call upon the Council to
assume its responsibilities and provide the Palestinian
population under occupation with the protection it
needs, in accordance with the Fourth Geneva
Convention.
