Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): That was a very
moving conclusion from Mr. Lillie.

Ijust wanted to say that I would like the record to
show that I did not get answers to my questions from
someone who ought to have been able to answer them
and that, for as long as we do not have answers to those
questions, the types of suffering, complications and
dilemmas that David Lillie has outlined will continue.
We therefore need to continue our efforts to try and get
to the bottom of the situation.

I will spare Council colleagues reflections on the
irony that the issue of freedom of speech has been
raised with regard to what we heard at the beginning
and the fact that my questions have not been answered.
However, I would like to stress that we will need to
come back to the issue. It is so important.
