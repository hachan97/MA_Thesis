Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
The Chinese delegation would like to thank Assistant
Secretary-General Annabi for his briefing. The Chinese
delegation has been closely observing the development
of the situation in Kosovo. We are deeply concerned
about the frequent occurrence of incidents of terrorism
and violence recently, which have caused a serious
deterioration in the security situation. We urge the
parties concerned to find out the truth as soon as
possible and bring to justice the perpetrators of those
acts.

We call on the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo, KFOR and the
Kosovo Provisional Institutions to make further efforts
to strengthen law and order, combat organized crime
and ensure the security of all ethnic groups in Kosovo,
especially the Serbs. That is the only way to create the
necessary conditions for the achievement of such goals
as the return of refugees and economic development.

China believes that the fundamental resolution of
the question of Kosovo will require consultation and
dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina with a view to
reaching agreement on practical matters, such as the
return of refugees and the rights of minorities and
missing persons, and thereby establishing a foundation
for the ultimate settlement of the question of the status
of Kosovo. Such achievements would also be
conducive to the peace and stability of the entire
Balkan region.

To that end, we hope that the two parties
concerned will, on the basis of Security Council
resolution 1244 (1999), initiate constructive dialogue
as soon as possible on those questions and, with the
help of the international community, achieve concrete
results.
