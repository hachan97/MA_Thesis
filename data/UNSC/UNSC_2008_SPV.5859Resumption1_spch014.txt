Mr. Gillerman (Israel): While I share the view
expressed by some members of the Council as to the
value of these debates, I feel that, at the end of this
meeting, I would be remiss if I did not express our
gratitude to the assassins of Damascus and the butchers
of the Sudan - both beacons of human rights - for
their expert presentations on terror and genocide. It
was indeed enlightening to hear a lecture about
targeted killings from a country under investigation by
this very Council for assassinating its own political
opponents in Lebanon, as well as about genocide from
the monsters of Darfur. Maybe this meeting did serve
some purpose after all.

As to the statement made by the Cuban
representative, ostensibly speaking on behalf of the
Non-Aligned Movement, I find it strange and
disturbing, just as I did the last time. While we heard
here today from several representatives of countries
that are members of the Movement a clear
condemnation of terror, and especially of the massacre
in Jerusalem on 6 March, there was not a single word
about terror nor was there a condemnation of that
brutal act in the statement made by the representative
of Cuba on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. It is
precisely because we hear such very different
statements from countries belonging to the Movement,
both around this table and outside the Chamber, and
precisely because of our deep respect for so many of
the members of the Non-Aligned Movement, that we
wonder whether the representative of Cuba spoke on
behalf of his own island. If not, whom does he really
represent? I believe that both the Council and the Non-
Aligned Movement deserve an explanation.
