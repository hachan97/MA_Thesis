Mr. Keita (Mali) (spoke in French): On behalf of
the Government and people of Mali, I would first of all
like to convey to the people and Government of the
United States of America our deepest condolences and
sympathies on the tragic events that took place in New
York, Washington, DC, and Pennsylvania on Tuesday,
ll September 2001. I also join with the President ofthe
Security Council in extending the condolences of the
delegation of Mali to the delegation of the United
States.

Mali firmly condemns those barbarous attacks,
which no cause could justify. We hope for the speedy
recovery of the many persons injured, and we pray for
the repose of the souls of those who have lost their
lives in these attacks. Mali stands in solidarity with the
American people and with any decision to be taken by
the Security Council in this regard.
