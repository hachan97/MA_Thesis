Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): I wish
to thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his
briefing.

The crisis in Ukraine is the result of a complex
fabric of historical and contemporary factors. A
political solution is the only way to end the crisis. To
tackle the crisis at its roots, both the current situation
and the historical facts must be considered, taking into
account the legitimate rights, interests and demands of
the various regions and ethnic communities of Ukraine
and the legitimate concerns of all the parties concerned,
with a view to achieving a balance ofinterests for all.

For some time now, various parties including China,
have been vigorously engaged in mediation efforts and
pushing for talks in order to ease the crisis in Ukraine.
The Geneva agreement reached between Russia, the
United States, the European Union and Ukraine calls
for measures to de-escalate the Ukrainian situation,
thereby sending a positive signal for a political solution
to the crisis. Regrettably, tensions in eastern and south-

eastern Ukraine have worsened, with each side more
vehemently accusing the other. Threats and sanctions
have again replaced dialogue and negotiation.
China hopes that all parties concerned will keep
in mind the broader picture of regional peace and
stability, and the fundamental interests of all ethnic
groups in Ukraine, maintain restraint, persevere in
dialogue and consultations, effectively implement the
agreement already reached by all of the parties and
continue to push for a political solution to the crisis so
as to achieve stability and development in Ukraine as
soon as possible.

China's position on the question of Ukraine
remains objective, impartial and responsible. From
the very beginning, China has called on all parties to
seek a political solution through dialogue rather than
confrontation, and we support international mediation
efforts conducive to de-escalating the situation and
seeking a political solution. China will continue to play
a constructive role in mediation efforts and pushing for
talks.
