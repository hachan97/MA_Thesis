Mr. Hamer (Netherlands): The Netherlands
agrees with the principle objective of the present draft
resolution, which is the establishment of the United
Nations observer force in the Middle East. Such a
United Nations presence could be useful, because it is
clear that the parties themselves are not currently
capable of bringing about the necessary de-escalation.
Nevertheless, the Netherlands will abstain on this draft
resolution. We feel strongly that its adoption now
would critically undermine attempts at convincing the
parties to accept such a United Nations observer force.
Moreover, this draft resolution may hinder ongoing
efforts to achieve what is our first priority, namely, the
successful resumption of the peace talks themselves. In
the light of the caution urged on us by the Secretary-
General last week on precisely these points, we are
disappointed that the Council is being forced to vote on
this draft resolution at this moment.
