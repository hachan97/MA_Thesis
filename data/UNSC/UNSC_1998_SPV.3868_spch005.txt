Mr. Amolo (Kenya): The Kenya delegation wishes to
express its support for the draft resolution which is before
us today. We express grave concern about the recent violent
developments in Kosovo, and while appreciating that there
has been some progress in implementing the actions
outlined in the Contact Group statement of 9 March 1998,
a lot more dedicated work is required. The Kenya
delegation therefore calls upon the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and other parties to move expeditiously to
achieve a political solution to the issue of Kosovo through
dialogue. We also call upon the Kosovar Albanian
leadership to condemn all terrorist action and urge them to
pursue their political, social and economic goals by
peaceful means only.

We believe that the proliferation of arms and related
materiel has exacerbated the already tense political and
security situation and believe that an arms embargo will
assist in fostering peace and stability in Kosovo. We
therefore call upon all States to strictly observe this
embargo. The draft resolution before us has a clear
mechanism for lifting this embargo, and we hope that the
clearly laid out conditions to enable this to happen will be
met sooner rather than later.
