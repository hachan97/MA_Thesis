The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached among Council members, I wish
to remind all speakers to limit their statements to no
more than five minutes in order to enable the Council
to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with
lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate the
texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version
when speaking in the Chamber. In the light of the many
speakers at this afternoon's session, I urgently appeal
to all members of the Council as well as
representatives of non-members alike to make a special
effort to limit their verbal statements to no more than
five minutes.

I shall now give the floor to the members of the
Council.
