Mr. Al Harthy (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): Let me
begin by congratulating you, Mr. President, and your
friendly country, the People's Republic of China, on
your presidency of the Security Council this month.
We are confident that your wisdom and your country's
policies will help you to steer the Council's work and
achieve the right results.

Today, at the President's initiative, the Council
is discussing a subject that is very important to
Member States and the international community 4 the
maintenance of international peace and security in a
multilateral world. Maintaining international peace
and security has always been one of the most important
purposes for which the United Nations was established,
and the President's initiative is consistent with Member
States' growing interest in multilateralism, as also
expressed by the Secretary-General and the Acting
President of the General Assembly.

There can be no doubt that our many and diverse
issues with global impact require global solutions and
cooperation on the part of all States, big and small,
especially with regard to the importance of reforming
the mechanisms of the work of the United Nations and
of avoiding double standards in the implementation of
justice and international law.

The Sultanate of Oman believes in the United
Nations and in multilateralism and joint international
action. In our view, they represent the best way
to resolve and settle many of the issues facing the
international community. We therefore hope to see
certain States move away from unilateral measures
that are inconsistent with the principles of the United
Nations and international law.

Peace and security demand that we believe in
multilateralism, joint work and commitment to the
Charter of the United Nations. That is what Member
States chose when they founded the Organization, and
that is what we should work for and achieve.
