The President: I thank the representative of Jordan
for her statement, as well as for her leadership. I do
not know of any role more difficult than that of being
pushed and pulled in so many directions as she has
been. The Ambassador has done a tremendous job with
incredible poise, and always with such regard for the
people who are not represented in the Security Council
Chamber. It has been a great privilege for all of us who
have had the chance to work with her. We thank the
Ambassador.
