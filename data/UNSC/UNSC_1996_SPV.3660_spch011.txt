Mr. Queta (Guinea-Bissau) (interpretation from French): On 31 January 1996, the Security Council

 

adopted resolution 1044 (1996), which, in paragraph 4,
requests the Government of the Sudan to undertake
immediate action to extradite to Ethiopia for prosecution the
three suspects sheltering in the Sudan and wanted in
connection with the assassination attempt on the life of
President Mubarak of Egypt, on the basis of the 1964
Extradition Treaty between Ethiopia and the Sudan; and to
act in its relations with its neighbours and with others in
full conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and
with the Charter of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU).

Nevertheless, my delegation regrets that the
Government of the Sudan has not yet complied with the
request of the Security Council, despite the efforts of the
Secretaries-General of the United Nations and of the OAU.

Guinea-Bissau condemns acts of international terrorism
in all their forms, and believes that the international
community should adopt practical measures to address such
heinous acts. In this context, my delegation reaffirms its
support for the 1994 United Nations Declaration on
Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism.

My delegation also reiterates its strong condemnation
of the attempted assassination of President Mubarak and its
solidarity with the Arab Republic of Egypt. It believes that
the attack affected the sovereignty, integrity and stability
not only of Ethiopia, but of all of Africa.

My delegation encourages the authorities of the Sudan
to take every necessary measure to promote all efforts
aimed at ensuring the implementation of Security Council
resolution 1044 (1996). As the draft resolution before us
does not, in our View, seem to have economic implications
that could adversely affect the civilian population of the
Sudan, my delegation will vote in favour.
