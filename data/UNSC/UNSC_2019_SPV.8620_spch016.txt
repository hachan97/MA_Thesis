Mr. Adom (Cote d'Ivoire) (spoke in French): I take
the floor on behalf of the three African States that are
non-permanent members of the Council to condemn in
the strongest possible terms the two attacks perpetrated
in Kabul during an electoral rally organized by President
Ashraf Ghani. We express our sincerest condolences to
the Afghan people and Government.

I would also like, on behalf of the three African
States members of the Security Council, to welcome
the unanimous renewal of the mandate of the United
Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA).
We commend the co-penholders, Indonesia and
Germany, as well as China, for the spirit of compromise
and flexibility they demonstrated in the course of
the negotiations. We can now only hope that resolution
2489 (2019) and the presence of UNAMA will help the
Afghan people to speedily restore an atmosphere ofpeace
and security conducive to comprehensive development.
