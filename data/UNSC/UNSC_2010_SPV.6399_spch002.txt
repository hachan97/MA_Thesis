Mr. Merores (Haiti) (spoke in French): I shall be
brief. I should like to express the gratitude of the
Government and people of Haiti for the resolution just
adopted by the Council. It demonstrates yet again, as if
there were any need to do so, the Council's ongoing
interest in the issue of Haiti since 2004. That is why,
on behalf of the Government and people of Haiti, I
thank the Council for having adopted the resolution. I
should like in particular to thank the Group of Friends
of Haiti and all our other friends who worked tirelessly
to draft the text that has just been adopted by the
Council. I also take this opportunity to thank all the
troop-contributing countries that are active in the
United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti
(MINUSTAH).

It is common knowledge that Haiti will hold
presidential and legislation elections in late November.
It is therefore clear that the renewal of MINUSTAH's
mandate will send a very strong signal to the people of
Haiti that the Security Council and the entire
international community stand side by side with Haiti
to assist it in the process leading to free, transparent
and democratic elections.

Allow me also to take this opportunity to thank
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for
Haiti, Mr. Edmond Mulet, and all the civilian and
military personnel of MINUSTAH who are working
alongside the Haitian National Police and the
Government to assist us in this process.
