Mr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): My
delegation voted in favour of the draft resolution just
adopted unanimously because it considers that, in the
absence of binding international rules preventing the
acquisition and use by non-State actors of weapons of
mass destruction, it is the responsibility of the Security
Council to act, on an exceptional basis, in order to face
the threat posed by the possible use by terrorist groups
of such weapons.

The text we have adopted contains definite
improvements over the initial draft that was before the
Council. These improvements respond to concerns
expressed by a number of delegations, including my
own, and I wish to thank the sponsors for that. Other
concerns, however, could not be fully taken into
account, such as a stronger reference to the concept of
disarmament; a reference to the positive contribution
that the establishment of zones free of weapons of
mass destruction could make to non-proliferation; and
the call for the early conclusion of a binding
international legal instrument on weapons of mass
destruction and non-State actors.

Nonetheless, the text is generally balanced and
responds in an effective and credible way to the threat
faced by the international community. It reflects our
viewpoint and we welcome it, as it represents a fresh
illustration of the determination of the international
community to act decisively, in a concerted and united
fashion, against the terrorist threat. Algeria is prepared
to make its full contribution to the implementation of
the resolution and to participate actively in the follow-
up Committee that it has established.
