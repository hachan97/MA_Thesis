Mr. Hickey (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom welcomes the adoption today of resolution
2303 (2016) establishing a United Nations police
component in Burundi. We extend our thanks to the
France for its patient efforts to try to find consensus
on the resolution. We regret that not every member of
the Security Council was able to support the resolution
today. A united Council would have sent a clear
message to the Government of Burundi to accept the
police deployment.

In the face of the worrying state of affairs in
Burundi, the Security Council had a clear duty to act.
The situation on the ground remains fragile, with a
very real potential for a spiral into mass violence. The
United Nations police component, working with human
rights observers from the Office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Human Rights, can help stop
that spiral. Together, they can prevent the further
deterioration of the security situation and help decrease
human rights violations. In doing so, the deployment
will help create an environment conducive to political
dialogue, a goal that all of us share.

But we need to recognize that today's resolution
is just a starting point. We must insist on the full
deployment ofthe 228 police officers authorized by the
resolution, and we need to be clear that this deployment
is designed to monitor the actions of all parties in
Burundi, protect all Burundians and support a political
solution to the crisis. But to find this solution, the
Government must commit to and participate in good
faith in a genuine and inclusive political dialogue. We,
the Security Council, cannot let up in our calls for this
dialogue. We must ensure that the eyes of the Council
remain on Burundi.
