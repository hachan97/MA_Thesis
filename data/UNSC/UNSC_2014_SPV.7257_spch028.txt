The President: There are no more names inscribed
on the list of speakers.

Before adjourning the meeting, as this is the last
scheduled meeting of the Council for the month of
August, I want to express my delegation's very sincere
appreciation first of all to the Secretariat. When one
sits in the President's chair, one realizes quite how
much the Secretariat does quietly behind the scenes,
and I for one hugely appreciate it. I also want to express
my appreciation, and that of my delegation, for the
interpreters who have worked extremely hard, but who
have had a particularly tough time this month, as we
have enforced the five-minute rule. That has meant,
however, that some delegations, instead of shortening
their statements, have read them faster.

I would also like to thank very much the members
of the Council. This has been an exceptionally busy
month. We have had six resolutions before the Council
in the month of August and five unscheduled meetings.
We have covered some very controversial issues,
including some thematic issues, that have required
real compromise. Therefore, I really want to thank
all Council members and their teams for the spirit
of compromise and dynamism that they have shown,
which has allowed us to get through the enormous
amount of business.

I also want to wish the United States delegation
very good luck for the month of September. I hope they
will not take this the wrong way, but I hope I do not see
Council members over the weekend.

The meeting rose at 5.25 pm.
