Mr. Ettalhi (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in Arabic): Like those who took the floor earlier, I wish to
thank Under-Secretary-General Pascoe and Assistant
Secretary-General Mulet for their briefings.
My country wishes to state its deep concern at the
escalation of violence and the very high number of
civilian casualties, displaced persons and refugees, as
well as the large-scale destruction in the capital of
South Ossetia and in other areas.

Mistaken assessments or a certain short-
sightedness can unfortunately lead to disasters of this
nature. But when that occurs, the international
community, and the Security Council in particular,
must urgently shoulder their responsibilities.

We see very clearly that a serious humanitarian
disaster has beset the region, and the Council must
focus on putting an end to it. In spite of the suffering,
the dire humanitarian situation and the deteriorating
situation on the ground, the Council has shown itself to
be incapable of agreeing on common language. My
country would support any initiative whatsoever, any
efforts whatsoever, aimed at reaching consensus within
this Council. Here, we reiterate our call for an
immediate ceasefire, for a return to the status quo ante
and for respect for existing resolutions and agreements.
