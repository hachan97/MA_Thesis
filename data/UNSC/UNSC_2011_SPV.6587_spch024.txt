The President: Once again, let me remind all
speakers that, in accordance with the understanding
reached among Council members, statements should be
limited to no more than four minutes in order to enable
the Council to carry out its work expeditiously. Longer
versions of statements can be distributed in writing.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Egypt.
