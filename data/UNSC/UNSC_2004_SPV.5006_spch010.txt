Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
First of all, I should like to thank Ambassador
Konuzin, Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism
Committee (CTC), for his briefing. With Ambassador
Konuzin as Chairman, I believe we can have every
confidence in the work done by the CTC. I support the
points he made in his briefing.

I would like to make three very brief comments.
First, we support reform of the CTC, and we welcome
Ambassador Ruperez as the new Executive Director
of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive
Directorate (CTED). We hope that, through the efforts
of the CTED and the Secretariat, the Directorate will
soon get down to work.

Secondly, China supports the visit by the CTC to
a Member State to gather information on the
implementation of resolution 1373 (2001) in order to
assess the need for assistance in combating terrorism.
China hopes that the visit will help ease the burden on
Member States in submitting their reports to the CTC
by giving them more time to implement resolution
1373 (2001).

Thirdly, we greatly appreciate the offer by the
League of Arab States to host what will be the fourth
special meeting of the CTC with international, regional
and subregional organizations. The League of Arab
States' holding of the upcoming special meeting will
be an opportunity to show the resolve of the Arab
world to combine its efforts to combat terrorism and to
demonstrate that all Member States share the common
cause of combating terrorism. That can only be
beneficial to the common cause of the international
fight against terrorism. We are certain that the League
of Arab States will duly complete the preparatory work
that will make the event a success.
