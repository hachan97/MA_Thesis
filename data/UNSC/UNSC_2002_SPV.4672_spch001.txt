The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now continue its consideration of the item
on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

After consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council.

"The Security Council recalls the statement
of its President of 8 October 2002
(S/PRST/2002/26) concerning the Work
Programme (S/2002/1075) of the Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1373 (2001) of
28 September 2001 (the Counter-Terrorism Committee).

"The Security Council notes the key role to
be played by international, regional and
subregional organizations in supporting
Government capacity-strengthening on counter-
terrorism and in furthering the implementation of
resolution 1373 (2001). It encourages the
Counter-Terrorism Committee to build a dialogue
with and encourage a dialogue between such
organizations active in the areas covered by that
resolution.

"In this context, the Security Council
requests the Counter-Terrorism Committee, with
a view to improving the flow of information on
experiences, standards and best practice, and to
coordinating ongoing activity, to invite all
relevant international, regional and subregional
organizations to:

"(a) Contribute to a report information on
their activities in the area of counter-terrorism;

"(b) Send a representative to attend a
Special Meeting of the Counter-Terrorism
Committee with international, regional and
subregional organizations on 7 March 2003.

"The Security Council invites the Counter-
Terrorism Committee to report on developments
at regular intervals."

This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol
S/PRST/2002/38.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 4.10 p.m.
