The President (spoke in Russian): Members of
the Council have before them document S/2011/744,
which contains the text of a draft resolution submitted
by Gabon and Nigeria. It is my understanding that the
Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft
resolution before it.

I shall first give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the
voting.
