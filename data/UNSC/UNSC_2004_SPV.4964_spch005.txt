Mr. Pleuger (Germany): I should like to thank
Mr. Passy for his interesting and very comprehensive
briefing. We feel that the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) plays an important role
in the field of security and cooperation in Europe and
in adjacent regions, not only as a forum for
consultation, but also in a concrete manner where it
runs field operations. As Mr. Passy pointed out, there
are significant areas of fruitful cooperation between the
United Nations and the OSCE, specifically in the areas
of conflict prevention, crisis management and post-
conflict rehabilitation. Perhaps Mr. Passy could give us
more details and more clarification about where he sees
options for enhanced cooperation between the OSCE
and the United Nations in the area of conflict
prevention and early warning.

As for a second question, we believe that in the
specific context of peacekeeping, cooperation and
burden-sharing with regional arrangements and
organizations make it easier for the United Nations to
become active in many regions. That is, of course, true
not only for the OSCE, but also, for example, for the
African Union and the Economic Community of West
African States. The regional organizations very often
have in-depth knowledge of a conflict and of the
specific problems of the area. We therefore support
close cooperation between the OSCE and the United
Nations and welcome every effort to increase the flow
of information between the organizations, as we are
witnessing today at this briefing. Therefore, we would
be interested to hear from Mr. Passy where he sees
areas for intensified cooperation between the two
organizations in the near future.
