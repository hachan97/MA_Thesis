The President: I thank the representative of the
Syrian Arab Republic for the kind words he addressed
to me.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is Mr. Ibra
Deguene Ka, Chairman of the Committee on the
Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian
People, to whom the Council has extended an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure.

I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and
to make his statement.
