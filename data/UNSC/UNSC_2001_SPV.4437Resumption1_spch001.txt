The President (spoke in French): Before giving
the floor to the next speaker, I would like to apologize
to Member States for the delay in the meeting's
resumption. The Security Council was engaged in such
intense consultations that our discussion was
prolonged. I reiterate our apologies to Member States.

The next speaker on my list is the representative
of South Africa. I invite him to take a seat at the
Council table and to make his statement.
