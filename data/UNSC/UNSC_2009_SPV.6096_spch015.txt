Mr. Jurica (Croatia): First of all, let me thank
Mr. Rashid Khalikov once again for his briefing on the
grave humanitarian situation on the ground in Darfur.
Yet again and after only a short period of time, we are
meeting to hear about things going from bad to worse
in Darfur. After hearing the news about four
peacekeepers being wounded near El Geneina last
week, now we are also informed of a peacekeeper's
death near Nyala. All of this is taking place in the
midst of the latest humanitarian crisis created by the
Government of the Sudan, which happened when they
decided to expel 13 major foreign aid agencies and
three Sudanese agencies, leaving more than 1 million
people out in the open, vulnerable to hunger, disease
and other perils. This is completely unacceptable.

Moreover, we fear that this could lead to further
difficulties in neighbouring Chad by causing a possible
fresh influx of refugees from Darfur. We keenly await
the assessment reports from the Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs which we expect
to be presented next week.

Again, instead of opting for a political solution
and working with the international community on
finding long-lasting solutions for a sustainable peace,
Mr. Al-Bashir and his Government, regrettably, did not
heed the calls for peace, instead opting for a worsening
of the already destabilized situation.
The Government of the Sudan has a
responsibility to protect not only its people but also the
international peacekeepers and humanitarian workers
who are in the Sudan to help the people of the Sudan.
There must be accountability for gross violations of
international humanitarian law, and impunity cannot be
tolerated. The Government of the Sudan must revoke
its inhumane and unacceptable decision.
