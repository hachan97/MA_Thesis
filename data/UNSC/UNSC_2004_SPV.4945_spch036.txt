Mr. Nambiar (India): I thank you, Mr. President,
for scheduling this open debate of the Security Council
on the situation in the Middle East at such short notice.

The targeted killing of Hamas leader Abdel Aziz
Al-Rantisi is unjustified and unacceptable and cannot
be condoned under any circumstances. Such action,
following closely on the killing of the Hamas spiritual
leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, can lead only to the
further destabilization of the already fragile situation in
the region and an escalation of the cycle of violence
and counter-violence.

As is known to all, India has consistently opposed
all acts of terrorism, including cross-border terrorism.
There can be no justification for terrorism in any form
or from any source.

We believe that the need of the hour in West Asia
is moderation and restraint so as to enable peace
negotiations to restart at the earliest. The violence must
be halted, and Israelis and Palestinians must work
together in a viable negotiating process aimed at a just,
lasting and comprehensive settlement based on the road
map set out by the Quartet. We have reiterated several
times in the past that the Quartet road map provides the
only existing way forward for the attainment of the
vision of two States, Israel and Palestine, living side by
side within secure and recognized boundaries, based on
Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973),
1397 (2002) and 1515 (2003).
