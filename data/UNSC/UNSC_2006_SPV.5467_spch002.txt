Mr. Dolgov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation shares the View of
members of the Security Council on the need to hold a
trial for former Liberian President Charles Taylor away
from the seat of the Special Court for Sierra Leone. We
note the constructive role played by the Governments
of the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, the
authorities at the International Criminal Court and the
States parties to the Court's Statute in connection with
transferring the trial to The Hague.

At the same time, we would like to inform the
members of the Council about how we understand the
resolution that has just been adopted.

The Russian Federation believes that, for the
purposes of this resolution, action under Chapter VII of
the Charter is unique and exceptional in nature, and
does not set a precedent for resolving similar issues in
the same way.
