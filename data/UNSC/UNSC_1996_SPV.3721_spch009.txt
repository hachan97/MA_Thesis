The President: I thank the Permanent
Representative of Venezuela for his kind words addressed
to me.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call upon those members of the Council
who wish to make statements before the voting.
