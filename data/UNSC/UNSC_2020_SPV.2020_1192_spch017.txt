I thank Ms. Fatou Bensouda for her briefing. I welcome His Excellency Ambassador Omer Mohamed Ahmed Siddig, Permanent Representative of the Republic of the Sudan, to this meeting. Viet Nam maintains its previously stated position on the Sudan, including as was expressed at the Council's meeting on Tuesday, 8 December (see S/2020/1183). We welcome the recent historic developments in the country, particularly the signing of the Juba Agreement for Peace in the Sudan on 3 October. We commend the continued efforts of the Government in that regard. It is critical that the Sudanese parties continue to fully implement the peace agreement so as to bring about lasting peace and development in the country. We also look forward to the full and timely operation of the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in the Sudan to support the country's transition in this critical period. At the same time, we are concerned about the reports of the increasing number of civilian casualties, including many women and children, over the past few months due to intercommunal violence. We call on the Government to take appropriate measures in addressing that issue, including acts related to violations of international humanitarian law. Viet Nam reiterates its consistent position that the State has the primary responsibility for the implementation of international humanitarian law and the prevention and suppression of serious criminal acts, such as war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression. While attaching importance to the establishment of accountability for violations of international humanitarian law and serious criminal acts, we maintain that it should be carried out in accordance with the fundamental principles of international law, including respect for the State's independence and sovereignty. In that regard, we take note of the thirty-second report of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court pursuant to resolution 1593 (2005).
