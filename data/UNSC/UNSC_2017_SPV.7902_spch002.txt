Mr. Bessho (Japan): As the Permanent Representative
of the lead country in the Council on the Afghanistan
file, I would like to make a brief statement.

Japan welcomes the unanimous adoption of
resolution 2344 (2017) and appreciates the support and
constructive engagement of Council members and all
interested parties. We are united in our serious concern
about the deteriorating security and humanitarian
situation, as well as in our commitment to supporting
Afghanistan and the Government's efforts to tackle the
many complex challenges it faces. Though there may be
differences in nuance in how Council members assess
the current situation, we are also united in recognizing
the important role that the United Nations will continue
to play in promoting peace and stability in Afghanistan.
That is why we have decided to extend the mandate of
the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan
(UNAMA) by one year.

Japan believes that the Council should have more
opportunities to better understand the current situation
on the ground. Japan considers that the time is ripe to
discuss how the Council can better support concrete
improvements in security and development. Japan would
therefore like the Council to consider a new format for
our meeting on UNAMA in June, which will provide
opportunities for Council members, along with Special
Representative of the Secretary-General Yamamoto, to
have interactive discussions on various issues.

Japan is committed to continuing to assist
Afghanistan on its path towards a better future, and
looks forward to working with the Council in the
days ahead.

The meeting rose at 3.15 pm.
