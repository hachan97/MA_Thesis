The President: Thank you, Mr. Sevan, for your
very comprehensive briefing to the Council.

Before turning the floor over to the first
representative on my list of speakers, I believe all
Council Members join me in extending our
condolences to the International Committee of the Red
Cross and to the families of all of those who were
killed or injured and in joining in the Secretary-
General's condemnation of this horrible crime.
