Ms. Bishop (Australia): Russia called for a
transparent and accountable investigation. Russia is
participating in it now. The Under-Secretary-General
said that the United Nations was confident that the
investigation was being conducted in accordance with
International Civil Aviation Organization guidelines.
Those are the very guidelines that the international
community has carefully established to ensure an
objective investigation.

I point out that resolution 2166 (2014) does not
create the investigation; it supports the need for an
investigation, for an investigation is automatically
required under the Chicago Convention. Through
resolution 2166 (2014), the Council supports that
independent international investigation. We demanded
integrity. We wanted access to the site - unrestricted,
full access to the site - and a cessation of violence.

It is in Russia's power to call off the separatists so
that we have access to the site. Let us get on with it.
Give the independent investigators access to the site.
The Netherlands, Malaysia and Australia stand ready to
return to the site, give comfort to the grieving families
and allow the investigation to continue. It is established,
it is independent - the United Nations says it is - the
other countries involved have given support, so we call
on Russia to enable the investigation to continue by
ensuring that the ceasefire is maintained and that we
can have secure, safe access to the site.
