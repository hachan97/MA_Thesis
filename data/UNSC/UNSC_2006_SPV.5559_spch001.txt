The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Lebanon, in which she requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Ms. Ziade
(Lebanon) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2006/832, containing the fourth
semi-annual report of the Secretary-General on the
implementation of Security Council resolution 1559
(2004).

After consultations among the members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council recalls all its
previous resolutions on Lebanon, in particular
resolutions 1559 (2004), 425 (1978) and 426
(1978), resolutions 520 (1982) and 1680 (2006),
and resolution 1701 (2006), as well as the
statements of its President on the situation in
Lebanon, in particular the statements of 18 June
2000, of 19 October 2004, of 4 May 2005 and of
23 January 2006.
"The Security Council reaffirms its strong
support for the territorial integrity, sovereignty,
unity and political independence of Lebanon
within its internationally recognized borders.

"The Security Council welcomes the fourth
semi-annual report to the Security Council, of 19
October 2006, on the implementation of
resolution 1559 (2004).

"The Security Council notes that important
progress has been made towards the
implementation of resolution 1559 (2004), in
particular through the deployment of the
Lebanese Armed Forces in the south of the
country for the first time in three decades, but it
also notes with regret that some provisions of
resolution 1559 (2004) have yet to be
implemented, namely the disbanding and
disarming of Lebanese and non-Lebanese
militias, the strict respect for the sovereignty,
territorial integrity, unity and political
independence of Lebanon, and free and fair
presidential elections conducted according to the
Lebanese constitutional rules, without any
foreign interference and influence.

"The Security Council commends the Lebanese
Government for extending its authority
throughout its territory, particularly in the south,
and encourages it to continue its efforts in this
regard.

"The Security Council reiterates its call for the
full implementation of resolution 1559 (2004)
and urges all concerned States and parties as
mentioned in the report to cooperate fully with
the Government of Lebanon, the Security Council
and the Secretary-General to achieve this goal.

"The Security Council reaffirms its support
to the Secretary-General and his Special Envoy in
their efforts and dedication to facilitate and assist
in the implementation of all provisions of
resolutions 1559 (2004) and 1680 (2006).

"The Security Council acknowledges the
Secretary-General's intention to revert to the
Council in his next report on implementation of
resolution 1701 (2006) and looks forward to his
further recommendations on the relevant
outstanding issues."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2006/43.
The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on the
agenda.

The meeting rose at 6.20 pm.
