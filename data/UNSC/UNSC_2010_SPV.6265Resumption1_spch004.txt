Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): I have the pleasure to
address the Security Council today on behalf of the
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), and to begin by
expressing our thanks to Assistant Secretary-General
Oscar Fernandez-Taranco for his comprehensive
briefing today, as well as NAM's sincere appreciation
to the Secretary-General for attending that briefing
today, stressing the importance of the subject under
discussion and the urgency of our debate today, which
comes at a crucial time when the peace process faces
one of its most difficult stages in the international
effort to realize the two-State solution and to put an
end to the occupation of the Palestinian, Syrian and
Lebanese territories since 1967.

The current crisis of confidence is a direct result

of Israel's refusal to move decisively towards a

political endgame and to implement its obligations

according to United Nations resolutions and the Road

Map, starting with a total freeze on all settlement

activities in the occupied Palestinian territory,
including East Jerusalem.

Despite all credible and serious efforts by the
Quartet and the regional partners to relaunch
negotiations and to achieve comprehensive peace in the
Middle East through the attainment of the two-State
solution and the Israeli withdrawal from all occupied
Arab territories, a just and lasting settlement to the
question of Palestine is still visibly far from being
achieved due to Israel's positions and continued
defiance of international law and Security Council
resolutions.

As such, the situation in the occupied Palestinian
territory, including East Jerusalem, remains critical,
continues to deteriorate and needs serious attention
from this body to overcome the current impasse and to
press on for the early resumption of the negotiating
process. This critical situation has been recognized
widely by neutral observers and the world's media.

The international community must be resolute in
demanding that Israel abide by all its obligations under
international law and cease all of its violations and
unlawful measures, including its policy of collective
punishment of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip
and its illegal settlement activities, and that it
unambiguously negotiate and resolve all core issues -
Jerusalem, settlements, the refugees, borders, security
and water - in a comprehensive manner and within a
fixed time frame.

Regrettably, since the last Security Council open
debate on this issue in October 2009 (see S/PV.6201),
Israel, the occupying Power, has failed to abide by its
obligations and continues to impede efforts to resume
peace negotiations by refusing to freeze all settlement
activities and by continuing to impose unilateral
measures aimed at altering the status, demographic
composition and Arab nature of the occupied
Palestinian territory, particularly East Jerusalem.
Moreover, Israel has not refrained from measures that
prejudice the outcome of negotiations on the final
status issues, thus undermining confidence, inflaming
tensions on the ground, preventing any progress and
10-22138
raising questions about Israel's credibility as a partner
for peace.

The unacceptable decision of the Government of
Israel to restrain rather than to cease completely all
settlement activities, and even to exclude East
Jerusalem from the scope of this unilateral decision,
falls considerably short of Israel's obligations under
Security Council resolutions, the Fourth Geneva
Convention and the Road Map, particularly because
settlement activity does not just violate international
law but undermines trust, aims at prejudging the
outcome of the future permanent status negotiations,
and imperils the basis of the two-State solution. The
Non-Aligned Movement condemns Israel's deliberate
policy regarding the construction of more new
settlement units and the continued Israeli declarations
in this regard in defiance of repeated international calls
to stop all settlement construction and activities.

In this regard, in the short period since the
unilateral declaration by Israel on settlements, Israel
has announced the construction of more then 1,600
new units, particularly in Jerusalem, in addition to the
construction of thousands more already under way. The
international community must use its political tools,
including the Security Council, to take necessary
measures to bring Israel into compliance.

The Non-Aligned Movement expresses deep
concern regarding the extensive damage caused by the
Israeli settlements, the separation wall and the inhuman
network of checkpoints, which are severing the
Palestinian territory in the occupied West Bank into
separate cantons, isolating East Jerusalem, undermining
the contiguity, integrity, viability and unity of the
Palestinian territory, and jeopardizing prospects for
achieving the two-State solution.

Further, the Israeli authorities continue to
discriminate against the Palestinian residents of East
Jerusalem, including by revoking identity cards and
allowing violent Israeli settlers to attack Palestinians
and confiscate their homes, properties and land, as well
as to devastate their agriculture and desecrate their
places of worship. The ongoing Israeli measures in
occupied East Jerusalem have not only inflamed
tensions in the holy city, but also have the potential of
endangering the already fragile stability in the region
as a whole.

Meanwhile, the unresolved crisis in Gaza also
continues to have negative repercussions on all efforts
to advance the peace process and inflicts unacceptable
suffering on the fabric of civilian life in Gaza. Israel
continues to impose a blockade on the Palestinian
civilian population, depriving them of their humanitarian
needs and preventing Gaza's reconstruction one year
after the unlawful attack in December 2008, in
violation of international humanitarian law and United
Nations resolutions, including Security Council
resolution 1860 (2009) and General Assembly
resolution ES-10/18, adopted at its tenth emergency
special session. The Non-Aligned Movement demands
that Israel immediately lift its illegal blockade and
allow the immediate and sustained opening of all
border crossings to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in
Gaza and to ensure its urgent reconstruction. The
Non-Aligned Movement again stresses the urgent need
immediately to begin reconstruction in Gaza and
deeply condemns the obstruction by Israel of the
import of essential reconstruction materials into Gaza,
as well as Israel's negative response to the United
Nations proposal to kick-start civilian reconstruction
activity.

Further, the Non-Aligned Movement calls on
Israel to compensate the Palestinian people for the
damage and trauma they suffered during its military
aggression on Gaza last year, along with compensating
the United Nations for the human and material losses
that occurred in that attack. The Non-Aligned
Movement also reiterates its call for the restoration of
the situation in the Gaza Strip to that which prevailed
prior to June 2007, and stresses the importance and
urgency of achieving Palestinian reconciliation and
unity. In this regard, the Non-Aligned Movement
reiterates its support for every effort to achieve a
speedy Palestinian reconciliation, including Egyptian
and regional endeavours to realize the just and
legitimate national aspirations of the Palestinian
people, with all its political groupings.

Turning to Lebanon, the Non-Aligned Movement
remains deeply concerned over Israel's ongoing air and
land violations of Lebanon's sovereignty, in breach of
Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), and calls on
Israel to withdraw fully from the remaining occupied
Lebanese land in the Shab'a farms, the Kfar Shuba
hills and the northern part of Al-Ghajar village.

Concerning the occupied Syrian Golan, the
Non-Aligned Movement reaffirms that all measures
and actions taken or to be taken by Israel, the
occupying Power, to alter the legal, physical and

demographic status of the occupied Syrian Golan and
its institutional structure, as well as the Israeli
measures to impose jurisdiction and administration
there, are null and void and have no legal effect. The
Non-Aligned Movement demands that Israel abide by
Security Council resolution 497 (1981) and withdraw
fully from the occupied Syrian Golan to the borders of
4 June 1967, in implementation of Security Council
resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).

The Non-Aligned Movement has repeatedly
warned of the danger and consequences of the ongoing
Israeli measures in the region. It is vital at this juncture
that the international community intervene and take a
robust and united position in order to strengthen the
process and to reaffirm the clear terms of reference for
negotiations on all core issues that are grounded in the
United Nations resolutions, the Madrid terms of
reference and the agreements reached between the
parties, starting with a total freeze on settlement
activities.

Accordingly, the Non-Aligned Movement remains
committed to supporting all endeavours that aim at
ending occupation and the establishment of a
Palestinian State living side by side with Israel in
peace and security, in accordance with the established
parameters of the peace process, as defined by Security
Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 1397
(2002), 1515 (2003) and 1850 (2008); the Madrid
terms of reference, including the principle of land for
peace; the Arab Peace Initiative; and the Road Map.
The Non-Aligned Movement calls for serious and
concrete actions from the Security Council in this
regard.
