Mr. Alemu (Ethiopia): 1 would like to add a few
words to what I said earlier.

First, let us not kid ourselves. There are many
double standards with regard to ensuring international
justice and fighting impunity. We strongly believe
that the original referral was absolutely wrong. We
in the region knew that was the case. Therefore, our
position on the matter is in no way to be understood
as allowing impunity. By the way, the African Union
is perhaps the only organization in the world whose
charter, which is called the Constitutive Act, provides
for the organization to intervene in the internal affairs
of member States in situations in which war crimes,
crimes against humanity and genocide have been
committed. I doubt that any other organization has that
kind of provision. I might be mistaken.

Having once made a mistake, the Security Council
seems to insist on not rectifying it. Frankly, the Council
has no case here, and Member States have to realize that.

Incidentally, my objection to what the Prosecutor
said was essentially based on the form and style of her
presentation, not its substance. Otherwise, the fault
lies with the Council, not with the Prosecutor. The
referral was wrong, and it needs to be withdrawn. I also
agree with what the Permanent Representative of the
Sudan said in connection with the statement delivered
by our colleague from the Netherlands concerning the
Permanent Representative of Senegal's past statement
(see S/PV.8132).
