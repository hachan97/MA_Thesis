Mr. Li Baodong (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
abstained on the resolution that was put to a vote just
now. Children and armed conflict is an important
item for the Security Council. China has taken a
constructive approach from the very beginning in the
consultations on the resolution. We have repeatedly
emphasized that all sides of the Council should be
patient in consultations and properly address the major
concerns relating to the resolution so as to make sure
that a consensus could be reached on the resolution
and that the Security Council could have a unified
voice on the question of protecting children. However,
the resolution failed to accommodate the reasonable
concerns of Council members, and it was hastily put to
a vote without adequate consultation.

China found it difficult to support a resolution that
continues to give rise to serious differences among the
members of the Council. In accordance with the Charter
of the United Nations and the relevant resolutions of
the Council, the Security Council should focus on the
protection of children in situations of armed conflict.
The resolution must not be willfully interpreted to
equate incidents of terrorist attack in Pakistan, for
instance, to armed conflict, which would exceed the
mandate of the Security Council. Pakistan is at the
forefront of the international fight against terrorism and
has made important contributions to cooperation in the
international fight against terrorism. The international
community should provide more support and help to
Pakistan's efforts in counter-terrorism rather than
creating difficulties and obstacles.
