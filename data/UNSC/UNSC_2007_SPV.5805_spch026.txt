The President: I thank Special Representative
Ould Abdallah for the very clear explanation and very
clear message that he has given us.

We have fully understood, you can be sure, Sir,
the rationale of your statements. I also hope that you
realize that one of the main objectives of this debate
was to strengthen your hand in dealing with the crisis. I
think that the debate has shown that you have full
support and that from now on you can feel that your
hand really is strengthened.
I think that your clarification has rightly focused
on the need to strengthen AMISOM, which the Council
has highlighted. It is a question of the credibility of the
partnership between the African Union and the United
Nations.

Also, I think it has to be clear that we must pay
tribute to Uganda, because, as you said, we speak of
AMISOM, but in fact that means the battalions of
Uganda - to whom all members of the Council are
grateful.
