Mr. Mayr-Harting (Austria): Today's adoption
of resolution 1966 (2010), establishing the residual
mechanism for criminal tribunals, is a very important
step in the field of international criminal justice. The
establishment of the residual mechanism sends a strong
Security Council message against impunity. The high-
level fugitives indicted by the International Criminal
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda cannot
escape justice. The legacy of these two courts will also
be preserved. At the same time, the resolution sends a
clear signal to the Tribunals to take all possible
measures to expeditiously complete their work, prepare
their closure and ensure a smooth transition to the
mechanism.

In view of our long-standing focus on the rule of
law, Austria was happy and honoured to be able to
chair the Informal Working Group on International
Tribunals and to facilitate the adoption of today's
resolution. I would very much like to thank all
delegations for their spirit of compromise, which made
the adoption of today's resolution possible. I also wish
to thank the Secretariat and, in particular, the Office of
Legal Affairs for the invaluable support they have
provided to the Working Group during the past two
years.
