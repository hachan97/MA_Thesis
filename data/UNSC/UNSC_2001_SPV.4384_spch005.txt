Sir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): The
United Kingdom very much welcomes the fact that the
Government of Sudan has complied as far as
practicable with the conditions for lift in Security
Council resolution 1054 (1996). Today's resolution
sends out a clear signal that the Council stands ready to
act once it has determined that a country has complied
with the demands set out in a resolution. Other States
that currently support terrorism should take note and be
led by the example which Sudan has set.

We particularly welcome Sudan's recent
cooperation with the international community against
terrorism, even before the terrible events of ll
September. The fact that Sudan has ratified the relevant
conventions on terrorism is a clear signal of that
Government's intent. The United Kingdom remains
actively interested in the pursuit of a just and lasting
peace agreement, which will benefit all the people of
Sudan. The lifting of these sanctions will allow the
intensification of diplomatic activity to this end. We
look forward to the day when the Security Council's
discussions of Sudan can focus on international support
for such a peace settlement.
