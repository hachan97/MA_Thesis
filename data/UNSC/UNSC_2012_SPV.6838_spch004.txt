Mr. Osorio (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): The
effective protection of children affected by armed
conflict is the primary objective that should influence
Security Council decisions on that issue. In that regard,
we support the work of the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict,
and welcome the appointment of Ms. Leila Zerrougui.

We have a considerable body of Council provisions
and decisions on that issue, whose effectiveness and
correct implementation should be assessed before we
broaden that legislative framework. What is essential
is to strengthen and increase assistance and national
capacity-building, as well as close cooperation with
States, in order to achieve the effective protection of
children affected by conflict.

Colombia voted in favour of resolution 2068 (2012),
but warns that there is a clear difference between the
incidents and situations that should be considered. The
Council should concern itself with situations in which
armed conflicts indeed threaten international peace
and security and are therefore part of its agenda. We
believe that the resolution which we have just supported
again fails in that regard. The resolution lacks a
reference to the need to restrict the content of reports of
the Secretary-General to the mandate entrusted by the
Security Council, which is clearly limited to situations
and contexts provided for in resolutions 1612 (2005)
and 1882 (2009) and 1998 (2011).
Colombia supports open consultation processes
that provide for the participation of all members and
the opportunity to address the concerns of all parties
involved through the genuine pursuit of consensus.
That helps to enrich the debate and the consideration
ofpossible compromise solutions to opposing positions
and ensures a transparent process.
