Ms. Sanders (United States of America): The
United States expresses its appreciation to Ambassador
Oshima, the Japanese mission and the Secretariat for
this comprehensive report and for all the work that
went into planning and undertaking this valuable
mission.
We applaud the efforts of the Government of
Afghanistan, as well as the United Nations Assistance

Mission in Afghanistan, for their hard and difficult
work. We are pleased that the international community
solidly supports Afghanistan and its democratic
transition. The United States commends the
extraordinary work of the members of the International
Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and NATO. Despite
many challenges, their contributions have improved
security, democracy and governance in Afghanistan,
added to its economic and social development, as well
as assisted in counter-narcotics and regional
stabilization efforts.

The recent trip of the Security Council clearly
demonstrated that the international community's
support will not diminish. We look forward to working
with the Government of Afghanistan and the
international community to help bring about security
and stability in Afghanistan, including through
continuing implementation of the Afghanistan
Compact. We affirm our commitment to working with
the Government of Afghanistan, ISAF partners and the
United Nations towards security, democracy and
prosperity in Afghanistan.
