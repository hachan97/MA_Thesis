The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.

Following consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council takes note with concern of
reports that Libyan-registered aircraft flew from Libya
to Niger on 8 May 1997 and returned to Libya from
Nigeria on 10 May in violation of resolution
748 (1992). The Council has requested the Committee
established pursuant to resolution 748 (1992) to follow
up this matter directly with the representatives of
Libya, Niger and Nigeria. The Council calls upon all
States to fulfil their obligations under resolution
748 (1992) in the event that aircraft flights originating
in Libya seek to land in their territory.

"The Security Council takes note of the letters
from the Permanent Representative of Libya dated
16 May 1997 (S/1997/373), from the Permanent
Representative of Niger, dated 13 May 1997, and the
note verbale from the Permanent Representative of
Nigeria, dated 15 May 1997. The Security Council
recalls that paragraph 4 of resolution 748 (1992)
decided that all States shall deny permission to any
aircraft to take off from, land in or overfly their
territory if it is destined to land in or has taken off
from the territory of Libya, unless the particular
flight has been approved on grounds of significant
humanitarian need by the Committee established
pursuant to paragraph 9 of the resolution."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/1997/27.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.
The meeting rose at 1.45 pm.
