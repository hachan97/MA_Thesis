Mr. Powles (New Zealand): New Zealand welcomes
the Council's adoption this morning of the resolution
authorizing the deployment of a multinational force to East
Timor in response to the Indonesian Govemment's decision
to invite an international peacekeeping presence through the
United Nations. My country will be among the earliest
participants, with others from the region.

Speed is of the essence in View of the gravity of the
humanitarian situation in East Timor. We welcome
Indonesia's pledges of full cooperation in dealing with the
crisis. Cooperation from all arms of the Indonesian
Government will be critical to the success of the
operation authorized this morning. New Zealand was
among those countries which urged Indonesia to invite an
international peacekeeping presence. We did so as a
friend and regional partner, and we are gratified by the
response of the Indonesian Government. In responding to
the crisis in East Timor we have sought to be helpful,
constructive and forward-looking. We welcome
Australia's role in making this multinational force
possible.

While it has proved necessary at this time for the
Council to establish a multinational force in view of the
urgency of the situation, I would like to place on record
New Zealand's expectation of its early replacement by a
United Nations peacekeeping operation, as envisaged in
the resolution. We look forward to seeing the
Secretary-General's recommendations to the Security
Council in this regard as soon as possible.
