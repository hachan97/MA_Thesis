The President: On behalf ofus all, I really want to
thank the interpreters, security personnel and engineers
for having donated 15 minutes of their available time
for peace and hope in the Middle East.

There are a number of speakers remaining on my
list for this meeting. I intend, with the concurrence of
the Council, to suspend the meeting until 3 p.m.

The meeting was suspended at 1.15 p.m. and
resumed at 3.10pm.

The President: I wish to remind all speakers to
limit their statements to no more than four minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements
are kindly requested to circulate the text in writing
and deliver a condensed version when speaking in
the Chamber.

I now give the floor to the representative of Qatar.
