The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now make
a statement in my national capacity.

Peru remains deeply concerned about the incident
involving the use of a nerve agent in public spaces,
which has seriously endangered the lives of at least
three people in the United Kingdom. We wish to express
our solidarity with the victims and with the population
potentially exposed to the chemical agent in question.

Peru condemns all use of chemical weapons. We
believe that such a practice constitutes, per se, a threat
to international peace and security and a violation of
the related non-proliferation regimes.

Accordingly, we reaffirm the importance of
investigating the incident through the Organization
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and
through the mechanisms and procedures established
under the Convention on the Prohibition of the
Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of
Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction. In that
regard, we believe that the results of the analyses
carried out by the mission deployed by the OPCW at the
request of the British Government should be known.
In line with the principle of the peaceful settlement of
disputes, we urge the parties concerned to cooperate
fully with the investigations, with a view to determining
the responsibilities and sanctions that may result from
the case.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

The representative of the Russian Federation has
asked to make a further statement.
