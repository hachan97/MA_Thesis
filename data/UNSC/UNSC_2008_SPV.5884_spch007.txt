Mr. Kafando (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French):
As members know, the conflict in Western Sahara is of
the greatest concern to my country - not solely
because it is an African problem, but also because of
the potential danger it poses every day, after more than
30 years of attempts to reach a compromise. In that
regard, Burkina Faso has maintained a consistent
position: to encourage the parties to persevere on the
path of negotiations, because, in our view, only the
parties concerned can resolve their differences - of
course, with the support of the international
community. We consider that the present resolution
encourages the parties to pursue negotiations, which is
why Burkina Faso has supported it: that consideration
is of great importance to my country. In our View, it is
6

of the utmost importance to send a signal of
encouragement to the parties so that they will
persevere in the negotiations in a spirit of good faith
and dynamic compromise.

We respect the views of delegations that have
expressed differing opinions, and we thank them for
their understanding, which has enabled us to adopt the
resolution unanimously. It is our hope that this new
resolution, which renews the mandate of the United
Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara, will contribute to progress in the negotiations
that the parties have already begun, in particular with
respect to the consideration of substantive issues.
