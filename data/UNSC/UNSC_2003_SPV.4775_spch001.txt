The President (spoke in Russian): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Rwanda and the United Republic of Tanzania,
in which they request to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the discussion without the right to
vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mrs. Booto
(Democratic Republic of the Congo),
Mr. Nyamulinda (Rwanda) and Mrs. Mulamula
(United Republic of Tanzania) took the seats
reserved for them at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The President (spoke in Russian): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Jean-Marc de La Sabliere, head of the
Security Council mission to Central Africa.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them photo
copies of the report of the Security Council mission to
Central Africa. That report will be issued as a
document of the Security Council under the symbol
S/2003/653 on Friday, 20 June 2003.

I give the floor to Mr. Jean-Marc de La Sabliere,

head of the Security Council mission to Central Africa.
