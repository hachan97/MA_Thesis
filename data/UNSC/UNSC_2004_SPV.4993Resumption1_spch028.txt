Mr. Martin: I think that any representative of a
civil society organization who had heard the whole of
today's debate would feel, as I do, very gratified by the
strength of the consensus that has been expressed
around this table regarding the importance of the role
of civil society in post-conflict peace-building. It is
striking to have heard Member States voice support for
a very considerable range of initiatives that the
Security Council itself could take or encourage others
to take, all of which are also in the spirit of the report
of the Cardoso Panel, which in such a timely manner
has informed the debate. As we have heard, these
initiatives have included the enhanced used of the Arria
formula, and I think that, particularly because I am
from an organization working at the international level,
I would stress again the importance of the Arria
formula being more open to those from developing
countries, from our local partners.

The measures have included the holding of
seminars between the Security Council and civil
society. As we have, many members have stressed the
importance of contacts in the field, which can be more
open to local civil society during Security Council
missions, engaging civil society in peace settlements,
mission planning and needs assessments, the utility of
appropriate references in Council resolutions and
mandates to engagement with civil society,
encouraging special representatives of the Secretary-
General to engage in regular consultation with local
civil society, the possibility of NGO coordinators in
missions, and the communication back to the Council
of the point of View of civil society on peacekeeping
operations.

I am certain, without purporting to speak for
them, that our local partners would warmly welcome
moves in all those directions. But most of all I think
they would welcome, as I do, simply the spirit of this
debate of openness and cooperation between the
Council and civil society. I thank you, Madam
President, and your Government for providing the
opportunity and for setting the tone for that debate.
