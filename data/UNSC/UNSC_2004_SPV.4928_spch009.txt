Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
should like first of all to express my gratitude to you,
Mr. President, for having convened this necessary and
timely meeting.

The Chinese delegation would like to welcome
the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia and
Montenegro and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of
Germany to today's meeting. I would also like to
welcome in particular the presence of the Secretary-
General, Mr. Kofi Annan.

The Chinese delegation is shocked by the serious,
bloody events that have taken place in recent days in
Mitrovica and other cities in Kosovo, resulting in many
deaths and injuries. We condemn those acts of violence
in the strongest terms. I would like to take this
opportunity to express our deep condolences to the
families of the victims. We call upon the Albanian and
Serb communities in Kosovo to exercise maximum
restraint so as to prevent the situation from worsening.

Those tragic events have demonstrated that,
almost five years after the Security Council adopted
resolution 1244 (1999), the situation in Kosovo is still
very fragile and there is still a long way to go before
peace, stability and multi-ethnic harmony and peaceful
coexistence can be achieved in Kosovo. The
international community, the Government of Serbia and
Montenegro and the Provisional Institutions of Self-
Government must redouble their efforts to that end.

We welcome the joint statement made on 17
March by UNMIK, the Provisional Institutions of Self-
Government, political leaders and other parties. We
support all the efforts made by the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General, UNMIK and
KFOR to re-stabilize the situation. We earnestly hope
that the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government
and other relevant parties will work closely with them
so as to prevent such events from recurring.
