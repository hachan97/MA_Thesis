The President (spoke in Russian): I thank Lord
Ashdown for his comments.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

I would like once again to take this opportunity to
thank Lord Ashdown for his efforts towards the
consolidation of peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and
to wish him well in his future endeavours.

The meeting rose at 12.30 p.m.
