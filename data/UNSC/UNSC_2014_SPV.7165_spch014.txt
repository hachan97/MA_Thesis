Mr. Quinlan (Australia): I thank Under-Secretary-
General Feltman for his briefing and his warning to
the Council. Australia strongly supported calls for the
holding of tonight's briefing to give the Council an
up-to-date sense of the continuing destabilization and
increased tensions in eastern Ukraine, much of which
has evidently been sponsored and condoned by the
Russian Federation.

We, with the rest of the Council, welcomed the
17 April agreement reached in Geneva on steps to
de-escalate the crisis, including commitments to refrain
from further acts of violence and provocation. That was
a positive development and, we hoped, a demonstration
of serious commitment to reduce tensions and work
cooperatively towards a diplomatic and political
solution to the crisis.

Ukraine is living up to its Geneva commitments.
It has submitted to Parliament a draft law on amnesty
for protesters who surrender their weapons. It has
initiated a process of constitutional reform aimed at
decentralizing power. It has committed to holding a
broad public debate on possible constitutional changes
and sought proposals for constitutional reform. It is
working to disarm radical movements. The Ukrainian
Government has also said that it will guarantee the
rights of Russian speakers to use their own language.
It has strongly condemned xenophobia, intolerance
and anti-Semitism and begun an investigation into the
distribution of anti-Semitic leaflets in Donetsk. It has
invited all political groups to discuss ways to resolve
the crisis in eastern Ukraine and it has supported the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) in its work to de-escalate tensions.

But what has Russian done since 17 April to honour
its Geneva commitments? Disappointingly, all evidence
at hand points to Russia's continued determination to
promote instability and challenge Ukraine's authority
over its sovereign territory. Russia's claims that it has
no agency in or influence over the actions of armed
militia groups operating in eastern Ukraine are not
credible. The seizure of OSCE observers on 25 April
in Sloviansk and their mistreatment and their continued
detention is a deplorable and cynical act against
impartial international personnel working to bring
peace and stability to the region, an act clearly intended
to impede the ability of all OSCE monitors to work in
eastern Ukraine. We call for their immediate release.

We have also witnessed continued and extreme
provocations, including military manoeuvres on the
Russian side of the Ukrainian border and reported
multiple violations of Ukrainian air space by Russian
military aircraft. We have witnessed the deplorable
shooting on 28 April of the Mayor of Kharkiv and
the abduction and killing of a Horlivka City Council
representative. We are seeing continued occupation of
Government buildings by well-armed and coordinated
paramilitary groups, including, today, the occupation
of Government buildings in Lugansk. We are seeing the
increasing intimidation of local populations and illegal
detentions. Under-Secretary-General Feltman has just
reported to us increasing reports of violence, with
people killed, wounded, beaten and tortured.

In those circumstances, it is appropriate and
necessary for the Ukrainian Government itself to
take measures to try to ensure security and protect its
citizens in its own territory. It has shown considerable
restraint in the face of extreme provocation, but it has a
right to enforce the rule of law and respond in a manner
proportionate to the circumstances.

We welcome Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs
Lubkivsky's statement during his 25 April press
conference at the United Nations that Ukraine would
protect its people from provocation in a civilized manner
so as to avoid bloodshed. We welcome Ukraine's recent
acceptance ofjurisdiction of the International Criminal
Court (ICC) with respect to crimes committed in its
territory from November last year to February 2014.
We urge Ukraine to extend the ICC's jurisdiction to
crimes committed beyond that date and to accede to the
ICC Statute.

For its part, overwhelmingly, the international
community remains united in its support for Ukraine's
sovereignty and territory integrity and in its position
that Russia cease its illegal intervention, interference
and provocative actions in Ukraine. Statements by
other Security Council members tonight are further
confirmation of that.

To conclude, Australia continues to call on Russia
to meet its Geneva commitments, to allow Ukraine's
elections on 25 May to proceed without interference
or obstruction, which is the right of every sovereign
nation, and to exercise its influence over separatist
activists in Ukraine towards those ends. The crisis
remains very dangerously poised. Active, genuine and
immediate efforts by Russia to defuse it are imperative.
