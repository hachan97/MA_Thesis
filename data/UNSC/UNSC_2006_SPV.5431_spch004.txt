Mr. Faaborg-Andersen (Denmark): Denmark
has just voted in favour of resolution 1675 (2006)
extending the mandate of the United Nations Mission
for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) for
an additional six months. Having done so, we would
like to add our appreciation for the efforts of the
Secretary-General, his Personal Envoy, Ambassador
van Walsum, and the MINURSO operation, for their
work towards finding a resolution to the protracted
conflict in Western Sahara.

Maintaining the status quo is not a viable option;
carries with it the high risk of a renewed outbreak of
hostilities, and it thus needs to be emphasized that all
parties concerned must engage in renewed dialogue
and negotiations in order to move beyond the current
impasse. Denmark would welcome any sincere and
well-conceived initiative that could move the issue
towards a mutually acceptable solution. We appreciate
the very difficult task of the Personal Envoy and would
like to voice our full support for his continued efforts
towards bringing about a peaceful resolution to the
conflict.

We thank the Secretary-General for his recent
report on the situation in Western Sahara (S/2006/249).
In that context, we would like to reiterate Denmark's
firm and long-standing position on the need for full
respect for human rights. We welcome the plans of the
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights to send a mission to the region, and we
look forward to receiving its report.
