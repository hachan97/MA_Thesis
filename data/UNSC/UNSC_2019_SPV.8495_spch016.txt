Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): Iwould
like to thank Under-Secretary-General Rosemary
DiCarlo and Under-Secretary-General Jean-Pierre
Lacroix for their briefings.

Recently, the ceasefire between Israel and Syria
has, by and large, held; however, there continue to be
Violations of the Disengagement of Forces Agreement
in the area of operation of the United Nations
Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF). The
Secretary-General has articulated his deep concern
over the escalation of tensions. The parties concerned
should implement the relevant resolutions and the
Disengagement of Forces Agreement in earnest,
exercise restraint and cease and desist from any action
that might exacerbate tensions along the ceasefire line.

It is particularly important to safeguard the safety
and security of UNDOF personnel and facilities so that
they can implement their mandate with assured freedom
of movement, safety and security. China commends
the constructive role of UNDOF in maintaining
the ceasefire between Syria and Israel, as well as in
maintaining regional security and stability. We support
UNDOF's full return to its mission area, conditions
permitting, to continue the effective implementation
of its mandate. We call upon all parties concerned to
continue providing support and cooperating to that end.

The Golan Heights is recognized by the international
community as occupied territory. The Security Council
has adopted a raft of resolutions that urge Israel to
withdraw from the Golan Heights. China is opposed
to any unilateral action or attempts to alter that fact.
China does not wish to see any further escalation of
tensions in the region.
