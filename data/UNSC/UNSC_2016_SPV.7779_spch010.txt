Mr. Rosselli (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): Today
brought us the terrible news of the death of Shimon
Peres, to whom we pay deep and sincere tribute. A
couple of hours later, we learned of renewed bombings
of hospital installations in Aleppo. It would seem
that this is a without end tragedy. The five pages of
resolution 2286 (2016) apparently have not been worded
strongly enough to protect these hospital installations
and medical personnel against these horrendous - and
as the Secretary-General has called them - cowardly
attacks on hospitals and medical personnel working
in them.
We thank the Secretary-General for the
recommendations that he has prepared, which my
country fully supports. We are also very grateful to
the International Committee of the Red Cross, through
our friend Mr. Peter Maurer - we have taken very
good note of his comments - and to the International
President of Medecins Sans Frontieres, Ms. Liu. We
fully support the proposal to establish a post of special
representative of the Secretary-General to investigate
attacks on hospitals and hospital staff.

My briefing was going to be somewhat longer,
but my colleague Roman Oyarzun Marchesi basically
read out my speech with his comments. I endorse
each and every one of his words. Therefore, the only
thing that I will stress in particular is the need and
the commitment to investigating and punishing these
horrendous acts. All preventive measures are necessary
and indispensable, but we must also recall that war
crimes must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of
the law and that we must therefore take all measures
necessary to ensure thatjustice is served and the guilty
are duly punished.
