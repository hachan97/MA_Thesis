The President: The Security Council has before it
the text of a draft presidential statement on behalf of the
Council on the subject of today's meeting. I thank the
Council members for their valuable contributions to the
draft statement.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among the members of the Council, I shall take it
that the members of the Security Council agree to the
draft presidential statement, which will be issued as a
document of the Security Council under the symbol
S/PRST/2013/1.

It is so decided.

I wish to thank all speakers for their statements.
We have had a full and comprehensive debate that
has lived up to the importance and scope of the topic.
The condemnation of terrorism was unequivocal. The
determination to address and combat it was strong and
unambiguous. The importance of a comprehensive
approach for more effective counter-terrorism efforts
emerged as a prominent and recurring theme. I am sure
that many of the important ideas and proposals that
came up in the debate will receive due consideration in
our work related to counter-terrorism.

There are no more names inscribed on the list of
speakers. The Security Council has thus concluded
the present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 7pm.
