Mr. Konishi (Japan): It was with profound sadness
that we learned of the passing away of His Excellency
Mr. Deng Xiaoping. With his passing, the People's
Republic of China has lost a wise and visionary leader.

It was His Excellency Mr. Deng Xiaoping who, with
great courage and foresight, crafted and vigorously
implemented China's modernization policies of reform
and openness. His Excellency Mr. Deng Xiaoping
attached great importance to developing ties and
promoting mutual understanding between our two
countries, beginning with the conclusion of the Treaty of
Peace and Friendship between Japan and the People's
Republic of China.

He honoured Japan with visits in 1978 and again in
1979, and in turn welcomed to China many Japanese
people from diverse sectors for close and wide-ranging
discussions. Indeed, the friendly and cooperative relations
which our two countries enjoy today are in no small
measure the legacy of this great man.

On behalf of the Government and people of Japan,
I should like on this occasion to convey to His Excellency
Mr. Qin Huasun and the members of his Mission - and
through him to the Government and people of the
People's Republic of China - my sincere condolences at
this time of bereavement.
