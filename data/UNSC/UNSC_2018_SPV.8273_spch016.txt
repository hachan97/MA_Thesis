The President: There are no more names inscribed
on the list of speakers.

Before adjourning the meeting, I would like to
convey my sincere thanks to the members of the
Security Council, as this is probably the last scheduled
meeting of the Council for the month of May. On
behalf of my colleagues in the Polish delegation, I
would like to express the sincere appreciation to all of
the members of the Security Council, especially my
colleagues the Permanent Representatives - excellent
diplomats - and the experts and colleagues from the
Council's secretariat for their support. Indeed, it was a
busy month. I hope that we managed to reach consensus
from time to time. Personally, I felt all of their support
and it was an extremely enriching experience. I learned
a lot, but I hope I was also able to deliver results. Without
everyone's contribution and without everyone's open
heart and spirit, we could never have achieved what we
achieved. I should also mention the interpreters in the
Chamber, whose role is crucial. I thank them for their
work. This was an extremely interesting adventure.

As the Russian presidency approaches, on behalf
of the entire Council, I wish our colleagues from the
Russian Federation good luck and great success. We
return tomorrow under the auspices of their presidency.

The meeting rose at 4pm.
