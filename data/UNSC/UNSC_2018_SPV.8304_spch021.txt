The President: I would like to thank Assistant
Secretary-General Zouev for his vast polyglot skills.
We are looking forward to having him in the Council
more often. There are still two more languages that
he should be able to master, and next time we will
hear his briefing in all the official languages of the
United Nations.

(spoke in Russian)

Since this is the last meeting ofthe Security Council
for the month of June - at least I hope it is - before
adjourning it, on behalf of the delegation of the
Russian Federation, I would like to express my sincere
gratitude to the members of the Council, especially
my colleagues the Permanent Representatives, their
mission staffs and the secretariat of the Council for all
the support that they have given us, and also for the
kind words I have heard today for our presidency. It
really was a busy month, in which we managed to reach
a consensus on a number of important issues within our
remit. We could not have achieved those results alone
or without the hard work, support and constructive
contribution of every delegation and the representatives
of the Secretariat, as well as all the conference staff,
the interpreters and translators, the verbatim reporting
service and the security staff, for which I want to thank
them sincerely.

Our presidency is coming to an end and I am sure
that the members of the Council will support me in
wishing the Swedish delegation luck in July. I hope this
official football, which has been our guiding light for
half of our presidency, will bring luck to the Swedish
delegation and will also remain on the table, according
to the agreement reached with the Swedish delegation,
until the end of the FIFA World Cup. We wish the
delegation of Sweden success with the presidency of the
Security Council and the Swedish national team success
on the World Cup football field, and many thanks to all.

The meeting rose at 4.45 pm.
