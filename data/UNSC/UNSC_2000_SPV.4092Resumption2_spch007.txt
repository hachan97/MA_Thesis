The President: I would like to announce that two
more countries or organizations will waive their right to
speak. The first is Mr. Bouabid, from the International
Organization of la Francophonie, and I thank him. The
second is Japan. We will circulate both of their
statements.

Ambassador Yukio Satoh, to whom I am deeply
grateful, has asked me, however, to read two sentences
from his speech to all of you now because they are of
great importance.

"Japan is prepared to make an additional
financial contribution of $300,000 to promote a
national dialogue facilitated by Sir Ketumile Masire.
With the contribution of $200,000 already made last
November to the Joint Military Commission (J MC),
Japan's financial contribution to the Lusaka peace
process now amounts to $500,000."

I would ask Mr. Salim to bring this to the attention
of the facilitator as soon as possible. I think it will be
welcome news.
