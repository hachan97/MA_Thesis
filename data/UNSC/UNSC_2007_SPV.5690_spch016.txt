Mr. Kuzmin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Like other Council members, we would like
to thank the chief officials of the Special Court for
their briefing today. We feel that this body is one of the
important components in the fight against impunity.
Beyond any doubt, its activities give effective
assistance to establishing peaceful processes in the
region.

The Russian delegation notes that the judicial
processes within the Special Court for Sierra Leone are
working quite successfully, and we note a positive
dynamic in the work of the Court. In our view, we need
to maintain the momentum built up by the Special
Court over the next few years.

Of course, a milestone in the work of the Court
was the capture of the former President of Liberia,
Charles Taylor, the chief accused by this legal body.
The Security Council adopted a resolution on the
transfer of consideration of the Taylor case to The
Hague a year ago. It must be recognized that quite a
long time passed between the Security Council's
decision and the actual start of the hearings on this
case on 4 June 2007. Moreover, as we have learned, the
hearings that started last Monday were interrupted and
their resumption is planned only for 25 June. We would
be grateful to the representatives of the Court if they
could tell us what the reason was for the delay in the
consideration of the case and how realistic the
predicted timeline is for its conclusion by the end of
2008 and for sentencing by mid-2009.

We of course attach great importance to this
question, because this case being considered by the
Special Court for Sierra Leone is a serious precedent,
not only from the point of View of international law,
but also because it could have a positive impact on the
peaceful processes in the region and on the African
continent.
