Mr. Holbrooke (United States of America): You
have before you further evidence of why the United
States and France have such difficult bilateral relations.
I am deeply touched by this, but on instructions I
would have to exercise my veto.

I am deeply touched, Jean David, by your
friendship and your generosity, and, of course, by all of
my colleagues who have spoken thus far, and I thank
you very very much.
