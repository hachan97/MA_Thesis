The President: There are no more names inscribed
on the list of speakers. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.

I would like to express the sincere appreciation of
the delegation of the United States to the members of
the Council and to the secretariat of the Council for all
the support they have given to us this month. Indeed,
it has been a busy month and one in which we rallied
to consensus on several important issues within our
purview. We could not have done it without the hard
work, support and positive contributions of every
delegation and the representatives of the Secretariat, as
well as the interpreters, translators, meeting services
staff and sound engineers.

As we end our presidency, I know I speak on behalf
of the Council in wishing the delegation of Argentina
good luck in the month of August.

The meeting rose at 10.30 am.
