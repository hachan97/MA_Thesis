Mr. Pecsteen de Buytswerve (Belgium) (spoke in French): Belgium voted in favour of the draft
resolution (S/2019/186) on the situation in Venezuela
presented by the United States. We did so because, in
the View of both Belgium and the European Union,
the draft resolution includes the essential elements for
a way out of the crisis, namely, a peaceful political
process; free, fair and credible presidential elections,
with international electoral observation, in line with
the Venezuelan Constitution; the encouragement of
peaceful, inclusive and credible initiatives; the security
of Venezuelan citizens and political actors; and, finally,
unimpeded access to humanitarian aid, in accordance
with humanitarian principles. Belgium also supported
the draft resolution because nothing in its text justifies
the use of force and it advocates for seeking a peaceful
solution. We regret that some have blocked prospects
for this.

As the Security Council prepares to vote on a
competing draft resolution (8/2019/190), I wish to
express the intention of my delegation to vote against it.
Indeed, the text lacks a critical element. For Belgium,
as well as for the European Union, the solution to the
Venezuelan crisis is through the organization of free,
fair and credible presidential elections. The Venezuelan
people have already suffered too much. It is high time
to let them decide their own future.

We also express our reservations with regard
to paragraph 3 of the draft resolution and stress the
importance of humanitarian assistance in line with
the principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality
and independence. It is unacceptable for irregular
armed groups to intimidate civilians and members of
the National Assembly who have mobilized in order to
distribute aid.
