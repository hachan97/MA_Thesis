Mr. Abarry (Niger) (spoke in French): At the outset, I would like to thank the Deputy Special Envoy for her briefing on the political situation in Syria. I also commend the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Envoy that led to the establishment of the Constitutional Committee. We support the Special Envoy in his efforts to facilitate dialogue between the parties. The creationof a secure climate, through the signing of a ceasefire to put an end to the spiral of violence, will help to establish the conditions necessary for the political dialogue we eagerly await. I urge the parties to support the implementation of resolution 2254 (2015), including through the return of refugees, the release of detainees and clarification on the fate of missing persons. No effort must be spared to secure the de-escalation and thawing of the political climate. The involvement of women and young people in the process should also be strongly encouraged. In considering the situation in Syria, it is essential, in our view, to take into account all aspects of the challenges that the country is currently facing. Whether it is the political aspect that we are addressing this afternoon or the humanitarian aspect that we discussed this morning (see S/PV.8707), a solution to the crisis must be inspired by the Syrians themselves, from all segments of society. The international community and the Security Council, for their part, must encourage and support the process by closing the gap between divergent analyses and interpretations and instead taking into exclusive account of Syrian interests in their decisions. The Syrian people have given the world so much and yet they continue to wait, during this difficult time in their history, for the help they need to recover.
