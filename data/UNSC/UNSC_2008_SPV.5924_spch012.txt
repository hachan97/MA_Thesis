Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China welcomes the holding of this emergency meeting
of the Council. We would like to thank Mr. Honwana
for his briefing.

On behalf of the Chinese delegation, we welcome
Prime Minister Dileita of Djibouti to this meeting and
thank him for his statement. I would also like to
welcome the presence of the Permanent Representative
of Eritrea and thank him for his statement. We also
welcome the presence of the representatives of the
African Union and the League of Arab States at today's
meeting.

China is attentively following the recent border
dispute between Djibouti and Eritrea. We find
developments in the border areas to be worrisome. We
call upon the two parties to proceed from the greater
interests of relations between the two countries and of
peace and security in the Horn of Africa. We also call
upon them to exercise restraint and prevent the
situation from worsening further. China hopes that the
two parties will resolve their differences through
dialogue and negotiations.

China supports African Union and League of
Arab States and other regional organizations and
countries of the region in playing an active mediation
role. The Council should continue to play an active and
constructive role in promoting the resolution of the
differences of the two parties through dialogue and
negotiations. The Council may strengthen its contact
and communication with Djibouti and Eritrea, listen to
the views and requests of the parties concerned and
coordinate with and support the good offices of the
African Union and other regional organizations.
