Mr. Araud (France) (spoke in French): I pay tribute
to the Permanent Representative of Nigeria and her
team in their presidency of the Council for last month.

Here we are once again, meeting to address the
crisis in Ukraine. Each time, the Council flaunts
its divisions and hence its powerlessness while that
unhappy country sinks into anarchy.

Let us return to the facts. In eastern Ukraine,
armed groups are gradually seizing the cities. They
enjoy no crowds of supporters other than a few hundred
demonstrators. Their heavy weaponry disqualigies
them as mere sympathetic activists. Russian officers
strut on local television. Observers of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe and jouralists
have been taken hostage. Numerous people have
been detained; more seriously, increasingly credible
allegations are surfacing of enforced disappearances,
killings and torture. These thugs have refused to
implement the Geneva agreement that was intended to
restore the Ukrainian State on its territory.

What has Ukraine done? After showing a restraint
that no other State would have exhbited in the presence
of these attacks on its authority - attacks that have been
organized, supported and justified by a neighbour - it
decided to use its army and police against the armed
gangs spreading a sense of insecurity at the expense
of people most of whom do not support them. These
gangs have so little in common with the spontaneous
coelescence of local groups that they were able to shoot
down a helicopter with a surface-to-air missile - which,
it must be acknowledged, is not commonly found at the
Kharkiv market.

By what right would anyone meddle in the internal
affairs of a State that is only seeking to restore its
violated sovereignty? At the bilateral level, we can
recall the need to act with restraint, but so far there is
no evidence that it has not done so. Going any further
would be to violate the Charter of the United Nations.
I know that reality has left that scenario far behind.
Having trampled the principle of the territorial integrity
of States, the same can be done to the principle of
non-interference in the internal affairs of States. After
all, in sin, it is only the first step that bears a cost, as
the moralists say.

Russia has proven that by renouncing, one after
the other, the principles underlying international life.
But it still has a few regrets as it spirals downwards,
so it tries, against all credibility, to blame the other. It
invokes the agreement of 21 February, which it did not
endorse and discovered only when it was too late. It
brandishes the Geneva agreement, for the achievement
of which it made no effort. Lastly, it makes accusations
that would be comical under different circumstances:
the Nazis are in Kyiv, English speakers have infiltrated
the ranks of Ukrainians - which makes me jealous
that no French speakers are included - and, finally,
the European Union is responsible for the violence.

No, the facts are much more simple. In reality,
Russia has opened a Pandora's box. They have let the
demon of nationalism escape. They have unleashed
bands of thugs on Ukraine. The only alternatives they
are offering Kyiv are capitulation or partition - and
they are suddenly discovering that this mixture can go
completely out of control; that nationalism can oblige
them to do what they do not want to do; that the thugs
act like thugs and, finally, that Ukraine, faced with the

impossible choice they wish to impose on it, can hit
back. At that point, the fire-starting firefighters shriek
loudly to try to make us forget that in fact it was them
who chose this road, and that it is Russia who should
retreat.

For our part, we have been saying for weeks that we
are seeking a de-escalation - we want a de-escalation.
But de-escalation implies that Russia will calm the
armed groups it is equipping and training; that it
will see that the OSCE observers are freed - having
still not publicly condemned their capture in the first
place - and open negotiations with Ukraine; that free
elections will be held on 25 May under international
supervision in order to give the Kyiv authorities
indisputable legitimacy; and that negotiations begin
between Russia and Ukraine. Compromises are possible.
Ukraine is aware of the stakes and is ready, and the
countries of Europe, the most closely concerned in this
crisis, are too. Constitutional reform that responds to the
concerns of the people of eastern Ukraine and respects
Ukraine's sovereignty is quite conceivable. But for that
to happen, we have to put an end to this bad spy thriller,
in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs is replaced by
an information service when a crisis has to be resolved.
What we need today is not a vodka-loving James Bond
but diplomats who can return to the principles that form
the foundations of international life.
