Mr. Bessho (Japan): Iwould like to warmly welcome
Foreign Minister Holguin Cuellar to the Chamber.
Japan welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution
2366 (2017) and is pleased to have co-sponsored it. We
commend the commitment of the parties in Colombia to
the implementation of the Final Agreement for Ending
the Conflict and Building a Stable and Lasting Peace.
The Council has responded to that commitment though
today's resolution.

Japan congratulates Colombia on the historic
completion of the laying down of arms on 27 June.
That is a major step forward for reconciliation. The
path to lasting peace will rely on the firm commitment
of the parties. We hope that Japanese support for the
rehabilitation of victims, post-conflict assistance such
as demining and various other efforts, will contribute
to the peace process and ultimately to the social and
economic development of the people of Colombia.

Much hard work lies ahead. A successful
reintegration process is vital to sustaining peace.
We appreciate the Colombian initiative for the
socioeconomic reintegration of ex-Fuerzas Armadas
Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) combatants, and
emphasize the importance of Government efforts to
foster self-sufficiency through capacity-building and
education. Proactive security efforts are also needed to
secure the vacated areas, deal with armed groups and
FARC dissidents, and protect community leaders and
human rights defenders. We will strongly support those
activities, including via the United Nations Verification
Mission in Colombia, but the Government's role will
be central.

Japan will work closely with Colombia and the
United Nations to support the parties in implementing
the Peace Agreement and continues to stand with the
people of Colombia.
