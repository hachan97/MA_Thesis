Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
situation in Syria is at a critical stage. The political
process is facing important opportunities. Any action
taken on the Syrian issue must focus on further
advancing the overall political process and strive
for long-term stability and security in that country.
We have repeatedly explained our position on the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-
United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM).
Significant differences persist among Council Members
on the issue. It is imperative for the parties to remain
calm, exercise restraint and find an appropriate solution
that is acceptable to all through patient consultations.

Given the major differences among Council
Members, forcing a vote does not contribute to
resolving the issue of chemical weapons in Syria
or serve to safeguard the unity and authority of the
Council, nor does it help to advance the political
process in Syria. China felt that it had to abstain in
voting on draft resolution S/20l7/970. We once again
regret the division seen on the Council today.
