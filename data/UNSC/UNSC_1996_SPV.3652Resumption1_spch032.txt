Mr. Diagne (Senegal) (interpretation from French):
Allow me first to convey to you, Sir, my heartfelt
congratulations on your assumption of the presidency of the
Security Council for the month of April. My
congratulations likewise go to your eminent predecessor,
Ambassador Legwaila, on the work he did during the
month of March.

I should also like to thank the members of the Council
for having kindly authorized me to address this meeting,
which once again shows how precarious the situation in the
Middle East is, and also reflects the determination of the
international community to reaffirm, forcefully and with
conviction, its concern over the dangers that Israeli
practices in the occupied territories pose for the peace
process.

The recent decisions taken by the Government of
Israel to impose a blockade of the territory of Palestine,
both within the territory and between it and the outside
world, thus restricting the free movement of persons and
goods, amount to a real determination to strangle Palestine,
including Jerusalem/Al-Quds al-Sharif, and its entire
economy.

As delegations that have preceded me in this
discussion have already stressed, eloquently and in detail,
it is difficult not to react to these various operations
undertaken by Israel, which are intended solely to
intimidate, punish and humiliate - to make an entire
people pay for the actions, however reprehensible, of a tiny
minority of extremists.

The complete closure of Palestinian territory, the
interruption in the continuity of that territory, the forcible
reoccupation of territories that had just been evacuated, the
confiscation of Palestinian lands and the strengthening of
the powers of Israeli settlers - not to mention other
humiliating acts, such as the destruction of houses and the
arbitrary arrest and detention of thousands of Palestinians:
all these measures, which we condemn and want stopped,
reveal the acute need for a balanced return to a logic of
peace, without which no just and lasting solution can
prevail in this ravaged land of Palestine, including
Jerusalem/Al-Quds al-Sharif.

Guided by this conviction, we wish to take the
opportunity of this special meeting of the Security Council
to make an urgent appeal to the authorities of Tel Aviv to
ask them to return to the path of wisdom and to put an
end to their current policies in the occupied territories,
including Jerusalem/Al-Quds al-Sharif; to abide
scrupulously by the relevant provisions of the Fourth
Geneva Convention, applicable to all territories occupied
by Israel since 1967, including Jerusalem; to comply with
the various resolutions of the Security Council, the
General Assembly and other United Nations bodies; and,
finally, to give a real chance of success to the ongoing
peace process, to which the Israeli and the Palestinian
parties have freely committed themselves with the
emphatic blessing of the international community.

We believe that the efforts and the sacrifices made
by the people of Palestine in its quest for peace, freedom
and justice have limits, even if we are firmly convinced
that the path to peace is often long, difficult and full of
obstacles, particularly in a region as troubled as the
Middle East.

My delegation agrees with the comments made here
by many participants to the effect that a resumption of the
peace process and its consolidation will depend to a large
extent on a return to the climate of trust and hope created
by the Oslo agreements and by the various international
conferences on this subject.

We must now recreate these same conditions by
calling upon Israel to demonstrate more restraint in order
to put the process back in its true context: the
establishment of a just and lasting peace, and, in the long
term, the reconciliation of the hearts and minds of all the
peoples of the Middle East.

It is important, therefore, that the Government and
the people of Israel once again undertake fully to
cooperate with the people of Palestine and its
representative: the Palestinian Authority and its leader,
President Yasser Arafat.

My country, Senegal, and the entire international
community are calling for this kind of genuine
cooperation, which is the sole guarantee of, and is a
prerequisite for, the successful continuation of the peace
process, which is in turn the only guarantee of the
security and the survival of the countries of the subregion.

In conclusion, I should like to pay sincere tribute to
all those in that part of the world who continue, despite
the present situation, to believe in and to hope for the
 

advent of peace. And I pay homage to the memmy of those
who have died for this great cause.
