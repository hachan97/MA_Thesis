Mr. Delattre (France) (spoke in French): First,
I very much thank Mr. Nickolay Mladenov for his
briefing, but more broadly, for his commitment and that
of his team.

We have been saying it for years - the false status
quo that seems to prevail on the ground is, in reality,
a situation that is deteriorating daily and which could
unravel and become an open crisis at any moment.
When peace recedes on the ground, it also recedes in
minds and in speeches, as highlighted in last month's
written report (S/2018/614) on resolution 2334 (2016),
which we again welcome in both content and form.
Generation after generation, Palestinians and Israelis
are becoming more estranged and are losing hope of
a settlement to the conflict, yet neither the passage of
time nor the proliferation of crises in the Middle East
trivializes the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or calls into
question its centrality for the entire region. Beyond its
daily consequences for Israelis and Palestinians, its
historical and symbolic significance is a determining
factor for regional stability. The Security Council
therefore cannot and must not at any cost abdicate its
responsibility and turn its back on the subject.

Regarding the ongoing situation in Gaza, since
30 March waves of violence have threatened to lead
to a new armed conflict. Three such conflicts have
occurred in the Gaza Strip over the past decade. More
than 150 Palestinians have been killed, including 115
in demonstrations and 68 on 14 May alone. France has
condemned the disproportionate and indiscriminate
use of force and called on Israel to respect the right of
Palestinians to demonstrate peacefully. We have also
denounced the exploitation by Hamas and other armed
groups of the demonstrations and its stated desire to
use them to breach the security fence. Finally, we have
condemned the firing of rockets and incendiary devices
into Israeli territory - hundreds of them since late May,
which is unprecedented since the 2014 conflict - as
well as the construction of offensive tunnels by Hamas.

The latest developments this week run the risk
of causing a brutal escalation that must be avoided
at all costs. In this extremely tense context, it is
up to the Council to speak with a strong voice to
prevent the escalation. The silence it has observed
since the beginning of the crisis is deafening and,
frankly, incomprehensible. It must give way to a clear
public message.

The violence of recent weeks cannot be separated
from the broader situation in the Gaza Strip. Beyond the
de-escalation and respect for the 2014 ceasefire, which
are urgently required, there can be no lasting solution
in Gaza without Palestinian reconciliation within the
framework of the Palestine Liberation Organization
principles, and without the restoration of power of the
Palestinian Authority in Gaza.

In that connection, we welcome the relaunching of
the process initiated in Cairo in October, which must
be accompanied by concrete actions on the part of the
Palestinian Authority to improve the living conditions
of the population in Gaza. We welcome the initial
decisions taken in that regard. Beyond that, only a
lifting of the blockade, accompanied by the necessary
security guarantees for Israel, will make it possible to
meet the needs of the population.

Alongside those efforts, an ambitious response
must be made to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The
Special Coordinator's proposals for the accelerated
implementation of priority projects deserve our full
support. Those proposals must be accompanied by
quick-impact humanitarian measures, which are
necessary to provide the population with a visible
response and to prevent further escalation.

In the same spirit, a collective leap is needed to
enable the United Nations Relief and Works Agency
for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to
continue its essential activities and to ensure the start of
the school year, both in Gaza and throughout the region.
The stakes are too high for the population concerned
and for the stability of the region. Given its historical
role in promoting regional stability, we warmly call
on the United States to shoulder its responsibility and
uphold its commitments on this key issue in the context
of the much-needed international mobilization to boost
UNRWA's budget.

Furthermore, the risks of escalation in Gaza must
not make us forget the gravity of the situation in the
West Bank and Jerusalem. The latest developments
in settlement policies threaten more than ever to
irreversibly call the two-State solution into question.
In that connection, I would like to highlight two
particularly serious points.

First, announcements of new construction in
settlements continue. After the 30 May announcements
of 3,500 new housing units in the West Bank, there
were further announcements in late June of more than
1,000 new housing units in Jerusalem, in the Pisgat
Ze'ev settlement.

Secondly, forced demolitions and displacements
of populations are now directly targeting areas long
identified as red lines by the international community.
This is the case in the E-l area, where Israel's
appropriation would separate the north and south of the
West Bank and isolate East Jerusalem from the rest of
the Palestinian territories. Destroying the continuity
of the Palestinian territories would make it impossible
for the two States, both with Jerusalem as their capital,
to find a solution. It would, instead, favour a strategy
of the de facto annexation of the West Bank by Israel.
The Khan Al-Ahmar community is directly targeted,
including structures that have received European
funding. Some 230 inhabitants, including nearly
160 children, are threatened with expulsion. In the
neighbouring community of Abu Nuwar, demolitions
were carried out earlier this month, displacing some
50 people, including more than 30 children. South
of Hebron, similar threats hang over the Palestinian
village of Susya.

In that connection, I reiterate that France's
position on settlements will not change. Settlement-
building is illegal under international law. It violates
the Fourth Geneva Convention and several Council
resolutions, particularly resolution 2334 (2016),
adopted on 23 December 2016. Settlement activity is
dangerous. It aggravates tensions between populations
and fuels violence. Finally, settlement-building is
counterproductive, as it gradually destroys the two-State
solution, both on the ground and on the political level.

This leads me to my last point, concerning the
lack of a viable alternative to the two-State solution.
The single territorial unit that seems to be taking
shape before our eyes would ultimately result in the
unequal coexistence of two citizenship regimes on the
same territory. It would mean, for the Palestinians, the
abandonment of their aspirations to statehood; and for
the Israelis, the end of their democratic project. While
we must fill the current political vacuum, a peace
plan that turns its back on the internationally agreed
parameters of the two-State solution would be doomed
to failure. Any negotiations must take place within
that framework, which is itself based on international
law and Council resolutions, including resolution 478
(1980) on Jerusalem.

As we all know, the destinies of Israelis and
Palestinians are intertwined. Neither people can
sustainably achieve its national aspirations at the
expense of the other. As a friend of both Israelis and
Palestinians, France has only one objective - the
implementation, through negotiation, of the two-State
solution, the only one capable of achieving a just and
lasting peace between Israel and Palestine. It will spare
no effort in that regard.
