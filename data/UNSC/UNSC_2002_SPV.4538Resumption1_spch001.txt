The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Cape Verde, the Central African
Republic, Ethiopia and Malaysia, in which they request
to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions ofthe Charter and rule 37 ofthe
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Da Fonseca
(Cape Verde), Mr. Poukre-Kono (Central African Republic), Mr. Hussein (Ethiopia) and Mr. Hasmy
(Malaysia) took the seats reserved for them at the
side ofthe Council Chamber.

The President: The next speaker inscribed on my
list is the representative of Sierra Leone. I invite him to
take a seat at the Council table and to make his
statement.
