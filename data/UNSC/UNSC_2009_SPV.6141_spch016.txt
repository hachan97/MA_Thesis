The President: I shall now make a statement in
my national capacity.

Turkey is deeply concerned by the nuclear test
conducted by the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea on 25 May. We believe that the nuclear test was
a clear violation of Security Council resolutions 1695
(2006) and 1718 (2006). Earlier, Turkey also expressed
concern at the launch carried out by the Democratic
People's Republic on 5 April. We believe such steps
undermine stability, mutual trust and confidence in the
region even further.

The Turkish authorities have condemned the
nuclear test in strong terms and supported the Security
Council to send a strong and unified response to the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea for this
provocative act. We believe that the resolution adopted
today contains the necessary elements for such a
response. It is our strong expectation that the
Democratic People's Republic and the international
community will comply with and abide by the
provisions of the resolution.

At the same time, Turkey also recognizes the
importance of encouraging the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea to return to the Six-Party Talks.
Turkey remains fully supportive of those talks and
considers them the best vehicle to achieve de-
nuclearization of the Korean peninsula. We believe that
the talks should aim to make concrete and irreversible
progress towards achieving lasting peace, security and
stability in the region. In that regard, renewed
determination by all parties to the talks is essential.

I resume my functions as President of the
Council.

I now give the floor to the Permanent
Representative of the Republic of Korea.
