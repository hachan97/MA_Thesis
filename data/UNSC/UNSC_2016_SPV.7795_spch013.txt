The President (spoke in Russian): I would simply
like to say that we cannot accept the criticism that
we did not follow procedure yesterday. We invited
everyone to speak after the end of the discussion,
and the Ukrainian delegation should also respect the
interests of all delegations that have put their name on
the speakers' list to have an opportunity to speak on the
agenda item that was discussed yesterday. However, let
us focus on the main topic we are discussing today.
