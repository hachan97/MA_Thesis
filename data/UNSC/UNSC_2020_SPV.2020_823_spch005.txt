I thank Special Envoy Pedersen for his briefing, which highlighted the various challenges that the country is facing in its tenth year of war. We also join others in wishing quick recovery to Deputy Special Envoy Matar from her injuries. Like many other Security Council members, we are looking closely at the situation in Syria. Despite the fact that the March ceasefire in Idlib is largely holding, we remain concerned about the sporadic clashes taking place in the area, such as the exchange of fire in the past weeks between Turkish and Syrian troops. Furthermore, terrorist threats persist. Just yesterday, a roadside bomb killed several people near Deir ez-Zor. Most likely it was extremists from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant who planted the improvised explosive device there. These and other similar incidents continue to undermine stability in the northern and eastern parts of Syria. With regard to political developments, Estonia expresses hope that the new round of talks within the Syrian Constitutional Committee in Geneva next week will accelerate the political process, which includes answering the legitimate concerns of the Syrian opposition. However, we note that a new Constitution alone is not enough for solving Syria's problems. National reconciliation requires much more, including the release of arbitrarily detained people and political prisoners, disclosure of the fates of disappeared and missing people, respect for human rights and free elections. Only after these basic criteria are fulfilled will the situation slowly start to normalize, and refugees will be able to return to the country. Unfortunately, we are still far from that point, as was highlighted by the various challenges described by the Special Envoy in his briefing today. Estonia and the European Union remain committed to finding a lasting and credible political solution to the conflict in Syria on the basis of resolution 2254 (2015) and the 2012 Geneva communique (S/2012/522, annex).
