Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): You looked at me, Mr. President, and I
decided that I would say literally just a couple of words
after all. Needless to say, I will not respond to the array
of facts or pseudo-facts presented by my Ukrainian
colleague, but I want to point out for the umpteenth
time that the representative of Ukraine is ignoring the
role of his own people. All his claims are directed at
Russia, but the situation in eastern Ukraine arose at the
very least after the Government overthrow in Kyiv on
22 February. We all know that perfectly well, and so
do our Ukrainian colleagues, of course, but they prefer
to ignore it, because they do not know what to say to
the Ukrainian people. We again heard about the idea
of Ukrainian unity. We have already expressed our
concern in our statement, which I will not reiterate.
However, blaming Russia will not resolve the issues of
the Ukrainian people.
