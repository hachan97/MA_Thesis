The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the
President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for his
statement, and I believe I may speak for all of the
members of the Security Council in expressing my
deep appreciation for the leadership that he has brought
to the African Union, as well as his personal and
political commitment to using peaceful and diplomatic
means to facilitate a resolution of the various conflicts
on that continent.

I will now give the floor to Council members
who wish to address questions to President Obasanjo.
