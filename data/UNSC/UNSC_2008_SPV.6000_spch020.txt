The President (spoke in Chinese): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of China.

Like my colleagues who have spoken before me,
I warmly welcome to New York the President of the
Republic of Djibouti, His Excellency Mr. Guelleh, and
thank him for his briefing to the Security Council. We
also wish to thank the Permanent Representative of
Eritrea for his statement.

Djibouti and Eritrea have tense relations arising
from their border dispute. We deeply regret that tension
and note that, following the outbreak of the border
dispute between them in June, the Security Council
issued a presidential statement (S/PRST/2008/20) on
12 June. We believe that the most important thing at
14
present is for the parties, in the interests of their
bilateral relations and of peace and stability in the
Horn of Africa, to remain calm and exercise restraint
so as to prevent the situation from deteriorating further.

We are always in favour of resolving differences
through dialogue and negotiation, and we are opposed
to the use of military means. We expect Djibouti and
Eritrea to start a dialogue as soon as possible and to
seek a solution to their differences through
consultations on an equal footing. We also support the
mediation efforts made by the United Nations
Secretary-General and the regional organizations such
as the African Union and the Arab League. We also call
on Djibouti and Eritrea to cooperate with those efforts.
We support the Security Council's continuing positive
and constructive role in promoting that both sides
resolve their differences through dialogue and
negotiation.

I shall now resume my function as President of
the Council.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 11.30 am.
