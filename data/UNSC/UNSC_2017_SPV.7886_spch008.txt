Mr. Bessho (Japan): I was deeply shocked and
saddened by the news of the passing of Ambassador
Vitaly Churkin. I happened to meet him on Sunday
at lunchtime; coincidentally, we we were seated next
to each other at a restaurant. He was with his wife, I
was with my wife, and we were all very happy at the
time. In fact, he had arrived a bit after I did, so I did
not realize that he was there. I suddenly heard a voice
saying, Koro, what do you recommend? I looked back
and there was Vitaly, looking happy, looking very well
and with his usual big smile.

We happened to be of the same age, so while a lot
of heated discussions took place in the Chamber and in
the consultation room, I always had something that I
felt for him. He was certainly a great, true, outstanding
diplomat. He worked hard for his country, but at the
same time we all loved him for his humour and his
willingness to try to resolve issues. May he rest in
peace.
