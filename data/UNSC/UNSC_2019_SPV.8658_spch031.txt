Mr. Dogan (Croatia): Croatia remains determined
to continue its constructive approach of partnership
towards Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the occasional
unconstructive slandering and divisive rhetoric of
some individuals will not affect that. Such attacks, as
the EU statement stresses, only raise doubts regarding
the real commitment of those politicians to the EU
integration process of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its
European future.

Let me conclude by stressing that Croatia remains
a staunch supporter of Bosnia and Herzegovina in
building a better future for its citizens.

I am sorry for a lengthy statement.
