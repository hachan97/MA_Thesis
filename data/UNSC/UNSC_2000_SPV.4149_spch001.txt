The President (spoke in Chinese): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the situation
concerning Western Sahara, document S/2000/46l.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2000/500, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by France, the Russian
Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and the United States of America.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the
voting.
