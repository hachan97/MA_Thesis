Mr. Wang Yingfan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
The past few days have seen a drastic escalation and
broadening of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. There has
been a large increase in the number of casualties on
both sides, including many innocent children.
Casualties on the Palestinian side have been more
serious, the economy of Palestine has experienced a
serious setback, and the suffering of the civilian
population has intensified.

China is opposed to violence in any form. All
along, we have called on both sides to exercise restraint
and to take all necessary measures to prevent the
situation from deteriorating further. In the current
circumstances, we urge the Israeli side in particular to
exercise restraint. The use of excessive force can only
result in a vicious cycle of uncontrollable violence and
conflict, thus making the prospect of reviving the
Middle East peace process even more remote. This is a
very dangerous moment for the entire situation in the
Middle East. We are convinced that peace remains the
option for all parties: it is the only option.

In accordance with his mandate from the Security
Council, the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, is
engaged in mediation and consultation among the
parties concerned. China supports the Secretary-
General's efforts. We call on all parties concerned,
especially the Israeli side, to cooperate actively with
the Secretary-General, and we support the early start of
work by the international fact-finding committee. We
should give serious consideration to the proposed
deployment of international observers in the area of
conflict in order to create favourable conditions for
easing the situation and for a resumption of peace talks.
