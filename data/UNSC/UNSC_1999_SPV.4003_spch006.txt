Mr. Duval (Canada) (spoke in French): Canada
unconditionally supports this humanitarian draft
resolution, which responds to the grave concerns of the
international community about the catastrophic
deterioration of the humanitarian situation in and around
Kosovo resulting from the merciless action of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia.

(spoke in English)

Canada strongly believes that it is entirely
appropriate for the Council to be heard on humanitarian
issues which clearly threaten international peace and
security. We thank the sponsors of this draft resolution,
which has engaged the Council in a constructive way to
recognize and help improve the situation on the ground.
