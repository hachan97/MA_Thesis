The President: There are still 49 speakers on
my list, so may I remind all speakers to limit their
statements to no more than four minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
Delegations with longer statements can circulate the
written text. I would very much appreciate it if speakers
could turn directly to the conclusion of their statement.
I request members' cooperation in delivering a
condensed version.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Switzerland.
