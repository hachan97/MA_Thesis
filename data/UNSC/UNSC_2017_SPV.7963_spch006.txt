Mr. Aboulatta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the
outset, I should like to thank Ms. Fatou Bensouda,
Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC),
for her briefing today before the Security Council on
her twenty-fifth report pursuant to Security Council
resolution 1593 (2005). In that regard, allow me to
stress the following points.

First, there is a unified African position regarding
the manner in which the ICC deals with certain issues
relating to Africa, which is reflected in the resolutions
adopted at African Union (AU) summits. Africa,
pursuant to these resolutions, stresses, inter alia, that
at a time when the continent is committed to combating
impunity in accordance with the AU Constitutive Act,
the ICC proceedings against President Omar Al-Bashir,
President of the Sudan, must be suspended.

Secondly, the AU summit resolutions urged the
Security Council to withdraw the referral to the ICC
of the situation in Darfur, and I have expressed strong
concern at the fact that the Security Council has not
responded to the request of the AU in this regard.

Thirdly, the ICC must not take any measure that
couldjeopardize peace, security, stability or the dignity,
sovereignty and safety of the countries of the continent.
The ICC must respect the provisions of international
law relating to the immunity accorded Heads of State
and other senior officials during their tenure.

Fourthly, and in conclusion, we reject any action
taken against any African country under the pretext that
it has not complied with its obligations under the Rome
Statute or on the basis of its non-cooperation pursuant
to Security Council resolution 1593 (2005), because it
did not arrest President Al-Bashir and hand him over to
the ICC, especially given that there is an obligation on
AU member States in this regard under the relevant AU
summit resolutions and the AU Constitutive Act.
