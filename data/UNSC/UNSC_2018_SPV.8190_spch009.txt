Mr. Inchauste Jordan (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): Bolivia voted against
draft resolution S/2018/156, submitted by the United
Kingdom, because during the only consultations the
draft resolution did not enjoy the support of all the
members of the Council and, despite the repeated
remarks and concerns expressed, including breaking
the silence, such considerations were not taken into
account. In addition, before today's meeting, Bolivia
supported the proposal of a technical rollover that
would make it possible to overcome the impasse.

Bolivia will not apologize to anyone for defending
the principles in which we believe, in particular the
sovereign equality of States. We regret that further
consultations did not take place in order to ensure a
text that took the remarks of all members into account.
We also regret the fact that there was no attempt to
reach agreements that allowed for a balanced text and
emphasized the situation that Yemen is experiencing.
Moreover, the tendency to involve other regional actors
in the crisis that Yemen is undergoing, based on the
argument that new members of the Council have yet to
reach an agreement, is irresponsible.

Lastly, my delegation is concerned about the fact
that there have again been attempts to use the Security
Council as a political tool with clearly unilateral
agendas that run completely counter to the purposes
and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
