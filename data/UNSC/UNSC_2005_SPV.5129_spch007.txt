The President (spoke in French): In accordance
with the understanding reached among Council
members, I wish to remind all speakers to limit their
statements to no more than five minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to circulate the texts in writing and to deliver
a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.
On behalf of the Security Council, I extend a
warm welcome to the Honourable Asha-Rose Migiro,
Minister for Community Development, Gender and
Children of the United Republic of Tanzania.
