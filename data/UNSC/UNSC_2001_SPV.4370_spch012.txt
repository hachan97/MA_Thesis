Miss Durrant (Jamaica): We meet in the Security
Council today at a time when the will of the
international community is being severely tested. The
horrible acts of terrorism perpetrated yesterday on
American soil have plunged our entire world into an
unprecedented period of peril, fear and uncertainty.
Jamaica roundly condemns these dastardly acts. We
share the shock, grief and anger of the Government and
people of the United States of America, who have
suffered untold casualties and enormous material
damage from these highly coordinated terrorist attacks.
The masterminds and those found to be in
collusion must be brought to justice. The global
community must demonstrate a solid front in our
struggle to defeat international terrorism. We believe
that the most effective response continues to be full
cooperation at the international level, as terrorism
poses a serious threat to the peace and stability of
nations and to the well-being of all our citizens.

On behalf of the Government and people of
Jamaica, I wish to convey our sincere condolences and
deepest sympathy to the Government and people of the
United States of America and, in particular, to those
who lost their loved ones or who were injured as a
result of yesterday's heinous acts.

Jamaica's Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon.
P. J. Patterson, has already conveyed these sentiments
to President George Bush on behalf of the Government
and people of Jamaica. Today's meeting undoubtedly
serves as an important opportunity for the Security
Council to reaffirm its condemnation of terrorism, and
we wish to express our strong support for the draft
resolution that has been placed before us for adoption.
We also support the call for the issue of terrorism to be
addressed once again by the Council - this time at the
highest level - in the near future.
