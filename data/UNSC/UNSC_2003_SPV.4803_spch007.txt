Mr. Mufioz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): I should
like to offer my delegation's congratulations to you,
Sir, on your assumption of the presidency, which, as is
already evident, augurs well for the work of the
Council this month. We would also like to express our
appreciation for the work done by Ambassador Arias as
President last month. We are very pleased to see the
Secretary-General at this meeting. His presence
certainly reflects the urgency of the issue and the
importance of the resolution that we have just adopted.

The international community and public opinion
demanded swift action from our Organization, and
particularly from the Security Council. We could not
have continued to wait for the Council to take a
decision while civilians, including women and
children, were dying in Liberia. That is the primary
reason why we voted in favour of the resolution.

There were other considerations, such as the fact
that, given the absence of local jurisdiction as a result
of the catastrophic domestic situation in Liberia, there
should be a competent criminal jurisdiction there. We
must ensure legal security, and it should be recalled
that personnel of the United Nations and of the
specialized agencies are granted certain privileges and
immunities, including immunity from criminal
prosecution. The same is true of bilateral agreements
on the status of forces vis-a-vis the host country. We
are concerned about the fact that, by making
exceptions, we might impede the harmonious
development of international law.

To sum up, Chile supported the resolution with
enthusiasm, since saving lives is the most urgent
priority. We must respond appropriately to a
humanitarian crisis that brooks no further delay.
