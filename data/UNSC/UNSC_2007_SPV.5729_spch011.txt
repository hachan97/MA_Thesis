Mr. Mantovani (Italy): I should like to thank the
Secretary-General for taking part in our meeting today.
I am also pleased to pay tribute to Ambassador Jones
Parry for his high dedication to the work of the United
Nations during the past four years, as well as to
warmly welcome Ambassador Ripert to the United
Nations and the Council.

Italy sponsored the present resolution, which, we
believe, provides the United Nations Assistance
Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) with the stronger mandate it
needs to carry on its important tasks for the Iraqi
people after the completion of the process outlined in
resolution 1546 (2004), setting out a key element of the
much-needed support of the international community
for Iraq.

There are several elements in the present
resolution that we believe to be important. The first is
the fact that it acknowledges the full sovereignty of
Iraq and the existence of a constitutionally based
Government. This is important, as we are convinced
that the solution to Iraq's problems lies first and
foremost in the hands of the Iraqi people and
Government. Secondly, it sets out a broader mandate
for UNAMI, a mandate that covers all the areas of
action that we believe to be relevant, and that thus
enables the mission to play a central role.

Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to
commend all the United Nations staff of UNAMI, both
local and international, and the Special Representative
of the Secretary-General, Ambassador Qazi, for the
important and outstanding work that they are doing in
Iraq through their high professionalism and personal
commitment in the face of a difficult situation and
great personal risks.
