The President: There are no more names inscribed
on the list of speakers.

Before I conclude the meeting, I would like to speak
in reference to the statement made by the representative
of the Russian Federation on today's agenda item.
The Security Council presidency acknowledges the
incorrect title of the item on the agenda for today's
meeting . It will therefore be corrected in the record
to reflect the correct title of the agenda item, as it
appears in the provisional monthly programme of work
of the Council, namely, "Peace and security in Africa:
lntercommunal violence and terrorism in West Africa".

The meeting rose at noon.
