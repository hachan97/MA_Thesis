Mr. Eitel (Germany): For the second time in four
days, the Security Council is discussing the situation in
Lebanon. This is not only justified but necessary, taking
into account the extent to which the situation in Lebanon
has deteriorated in the meantime.

An ever-increasing number of innocent civilians are
becoming victims of the violence. More and more people
are being killed every day.

During this Council's formal meeting on Lebanon
held last Monday, Italy, on behalf of the European Union,
expressed concern regarding the security of the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). Regrettably,
this concern has proved to be more than justified. We call
upon all parties concerned fully to respect the safety,
security and freedom of movement of UNIFIL.

Today's shelling incident, in which more than 90
civilians were killed at a UNIFIL site, is particularly
shocking. We want to express our sincere condolences to
the families of the victims.

How do we get out of this situation? How can we
stop the suffering? The violence must come to an end,
and it must come to an end now.

International humanitarian law must be fully
respected. The safety and security of civilians and other
protected persons is of the highest priority, and must be
ensured.

There must be a political solution on the basis of all
relevant Security Council resolutions, including resolution
425 (1978). We believe that such a political solution, in
the framework of the peace process, will best be helped
by a decision of the Council that addresses the principal
problems and at the same time commands the widest
support. That is why we voted for the draft resolution
contained in document S/1996/304, and that is why, in
consequence, we had to abstain in the vote on the draft
resolution contained in document S/ 1996/292.
