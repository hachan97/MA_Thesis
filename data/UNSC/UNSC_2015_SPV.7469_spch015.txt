Mr. Gimolieca (Angola): We thank Ambassador
Roman Oyarzun Marchesi for the presentation of
the report and for his excellent work as Chair of the
Security Council Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1737 (2006).

We are pleased that no new incidents have been
reported during the past three months, and we sincerely
hope that there will be a positive outcome to the
ongoing negotiations with the Islamic Republic of Iran
regarding its nuclear programme. We understand the
sensitive nature of some of the issues being discussed
by both sides in the negotiating process, and we hope
that the negotiators will be able to find ways that
address the concerns that Iran has expressed and those
expressed by the E3+3 regarding ways to improve the
inspections regime and to ensure that Iran addresses
questions about its past nuclear activities.

According to recent reports in the media, Iranian
and Western officials have clashed over key details ofa
final deal in recent days, and critical differences have
emerged in the negotiating room. Since we do not have
any information regarding those differences and the
points of contention, all we can do is hope that those
differences can be overcome and a final accord reached
by the deadline of 20 June, so that the international
sanctions, which have severely affected the Iranian
people, can begin to be lifted.
