The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of El Salvador, in which she requests
to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Ms. Gallardo
(El Salvador), took the seat reserved for her at
the side of the Council Chamber

The President (spoke in Spanish): In accordance
with the usual practice, and in the absence of objection,
I shall take it that the Security Council agrees to extend
an invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Ms. Carol Bellamy, Executive Director of
the United Nations Children's Fund.

It is so decided.

I invite Ms. Bellamy to take a seat at the Council
table and to make her statement.
