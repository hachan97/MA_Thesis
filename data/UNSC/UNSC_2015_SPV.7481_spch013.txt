Mr. Delattre (France) (spoke in French): France
deeply regrets Russia's opposition to the adoption of a
draft resolution whose goal was to honour the memory
not only of the victims of the genocide in Srebenica,
but also that of the innocent victims on all sides during
the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in order to
recall the Security Council's special responsibility
to prevent such massacres. A subject such as this
deserved unanimous support from the Council. But by
opposing this draft resolution, Russia has prevented the
Security Council from expressing any support for the
commemoration and remembrance of the victims of the
genocide and the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Under the pretext of ensuring respect for a particular
remembrance, Russia has opposed the Security
Council's enjoining the parties to move beyond the
suffering of the past and to advance with determination
on the path to reconciliation. Reconciliation will require
recognition ofthe genocide committed in Srebrenica 20
years ago, which was defined as such by international
courts including the Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia
and the International Court of Justice.

Justice - and we cannot make this point strongly
enough- is the cornerstone ofreconciliation and peace.
The text, which we backed from the very beginning,
had the aim of remembrance, but it was also forward-
looking. It was also aimed at assisting in the process of
reconciliation among the peoples of the Balkans and
helping them forge a future of security and peace. We
deeply regret the failure to adopt the draft resolution
today, but we will not give up. We must continue to
work together for reconciliation and peace. That is the
responsibility of us all.
