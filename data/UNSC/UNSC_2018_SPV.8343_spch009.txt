Mr. Skoog (Sweden): We thank the United
Kingdom for its timely update.

We note the significance of the new information
from the British investigation; we underline our
confidence in the British findings. We call on
Russia to change course, cooperate with the ongoing
investigation and prosecution and fully disclose any
nerve agent programmes to the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). The most
recent information provides further evidence that it is
highly likely that Russia was responsible for the attack,
as previously stated by the European Council.

We regret that, since the Council last discussed
these developments (see S/PV.8237), a British national
in Amesbury tragically died following contact with a
substance that the OPCW confirmed to be the same
Novichok nerve agent that poisoned Sergei and Yulia
Skripal. We reiterate our strong condemnation of the
use ofa nerve agent on British soil and express our full
solidarity with the United Kingdom, our close friend
and European Union partner.
Once again here in the Chamber, we condemn in
the strongest terms all use of chemical weapons, strictly
prohibited under international law. It is a common
responsibility to ensure that the chemical-weapons ban
be respected. It can be argued that permanent members
of the Security Council have special responsibilities
when it comes to curbing weapons of mass destruction.
The rules-based international system protects us all, and
we must ensure its integrity. In that regard, we reiterate
our full support for the OPCW - the independent
international organization charged with overseeing the
chemical-weapons ban.
