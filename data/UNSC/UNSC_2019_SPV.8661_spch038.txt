Ms. Fitah-Kona (spoke in French): I would say
that it is precisely because patrols are unarmed that
they are able to win the trust of the people. I would
also like to add that there are only three women in the
patrols in the Kilometre-5 district, so we also need to
strengthen the presence of women in the United Nations
Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in
the Central African Republic (MINUSCA). They patrol
the entire district on foot and without weapons, which
fosters the people's trust in community-based policing.
I would also like to mention that, since that crisis, our
internal security forces have not been operational and
are not present in the Third Arrondissement. However,
thanks to MINUSCA, conditions have improved in the
PK5 neighbourhood, where I am a Municipal Adviser.

Allow me to offer my final thoughts. I would like to
say that greater efforts must be made to protect women
involved in community-based policing and even to
encourage them. I also wish to state that disarmament

must take place in our country, because we have lived
through war. That would allow to promote development
and respect for human rights. We also need to hold
democratic elections in our country and ensure
acceptable security conditions.

I would like to conclude by reaffirming that the
Central African Republic is counting on the international
community. They are our brothers and sisters and must
help us by supporting the peace process.
