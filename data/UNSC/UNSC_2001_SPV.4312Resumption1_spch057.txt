Mr. David (Israel): We regret the statement made
by the Syrian representative, who insists on paying
mere lip service to the principles of international
humanitarian law and respect for territorial integrity.
The Syrians must respect the lesson they are espousing.
Syria itself is the occupying Power in Lebanon. Today
it is the sole occupying Power in Lebanon. Israel, on
the other hand, has fully fulfilled its responsibilities
under Security Council resolution 425 (1978) and has
fully withdrawn from southern Lebanon, according to
all United Nations verification mechanisms and
documents.

Syria itself must respect the territorial integrity of
Lebanon, as well as other countries in our region, Israel
included. Syria is a major supporter of Hezbollah,
feeding instability along our northern borders and
endangering the lives of innocent Israeli civilians.

As far as genocide is concerned, it should be
remembered that Syria is responsible for having
targeted Israeli civilians for two decades. I shall not
refer in detail to its own genocide policy against its
own people. Hama is only one example. The Syrian
representative had better check his own record and
selective memory before launching a baseless verbal
attack at the expense of the Security Council members'
time.
