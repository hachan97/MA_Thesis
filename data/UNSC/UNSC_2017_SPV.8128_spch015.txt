Mr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): I would like to
thank Special Coordinator Nickolay Mladenov for
his statement.

Ukraine is convinced that the issue of Jerusalem
is a final-status issue that needs to be resolved through
negotiations only and in strict compliance with the
relevant Security Council resolutions. We believe
that the United Nations, through the Office of Special
Coordinator Mladenov, as well as the Quartet, must
redouble their efforts to resume the negotiations and
to achieve progress in the Middle East peace process.
