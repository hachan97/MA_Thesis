Mr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): The
importance which the European Union ascribes to the
issue under discussion today is underscored by the
presence here of the High Representative for the
European Union's Common Foreign and Security
Policy, Mr. Javier Solana. I would request you, Sir, to
grant him the opportunity to speak.
