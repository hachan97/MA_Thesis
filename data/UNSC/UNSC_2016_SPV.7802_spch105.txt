Mr. Safaei (Islamic Republic of Iran): 1 have
asked for the floor to react to the statement made by
the representative of the Israeli regime during this
debate, which was totally irrelevant to the subject of
the debate, namely, facing asymmetrical threats to
peace operations. That representative chose not to talk
about the daily violations of resolution 1701 (2006), as
documented in many reports submitted to the Council.
Instead, he once again levelled some baseless and
fabricated accusations against my Government in his
statement to the Council.

I take this opportunity to categorically reject
those accusations, which have been repeated many
times in the past and each time without a shred of
evidence to substantiate those accusations. Apparently,
his delegation assumes that the mere repetition of an
accusation may make it acceptable and believable by
part of the audience. Not only is that assumption wrong,
but also the repetition of those baseless accusations
is repugnant and repulsive. Israel just hopes that, by
repeating the allegations against Iran, it can cover up
its crimes against Palestinian civilians and distract
the international community from the scourge of its
occupation of the Palestinian and Arab lands for so
many decades and its crimes in suppressing the rights
of the whole nation. What Israel has so far done in
attacking Iran did not serve this purpose and, no doubt,
it will not in the future.
