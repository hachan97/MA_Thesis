The President (spoke in French): On behalf of
the members of the Security Council, I should like to
thank all the ambassadors and the members of the
Security Council and the Secretariat who participated
in the mission for the way in which they discharged
their important responsibilities on the Council's behalf.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. I now invite members to meet for brief
consultations.

The meeting rose at 3.40 p.m.
