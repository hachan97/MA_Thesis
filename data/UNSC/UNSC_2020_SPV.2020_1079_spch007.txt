I thank Ambassador Kridelka for his briefing. I really appreciate the stewardship that he has shown on the Committee pursuant to resolution 751 (1992), concerning Somalia. The United States appreciates the wealth of information that has been briefed to the Committee by the Panel of Experts on Somalia and the representatives from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs over the past 120 days. The United States remains focused on limiting the ability of Al-Shabaab to conduct attacks against civilians, and we are committed to partnering with Member States to utilize the Somalia sanctions regime of the Committee to its full extent. That effort includes technical assistance and capacity-building to counter the financing of terrorism and the threat of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The United States is encouraged to hear that the Panel and the Federal Government of Somalia have enhanced cooperation and information-sharing in order to support a constructive working relationship and enable the Panel to successfully fulfil its mandate. Addressing the ongoing Al-Shabaab threat requires close cooperation between the Federal Government of Somalia, the Somali private sector and international partners in order to disrupt its sources of financing. We are encouraged to learn that such cooperation has been gaining momentum. We urge Member States to support ongoing Committee measures and sanctions designations and to renew and fully implement resolution 2498 (2019), which outlines the arms embargo provisions and imposes an IED components ban. The United States recognizes the challenges posed to peace and stability in Somalia, which are further compounded by the spread of the coronavirus disease. We must continue to work together to employ all available tools to promote peace and security in Somalia and the region and to ensure a better future for all Somalis.
