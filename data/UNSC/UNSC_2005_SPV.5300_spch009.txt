Mr. Sumaida'ie (Iraq): I wish first to express the
appreciation of my delegation for the positive response
of the Security Council to the request by the Prime
Minister of Iraq to extend the mandates of the
multinational force, the Development Fund for Iraq and
the International Advisory and Monitoring Board. I
would like to thank each member of the Security
Council for their positive contribution and the spirit in
which the preparations for the resolution took place.

We note with satisfaction the manner in which the
resolution was adopted in an environment of harmony
and agreement on the principles laid out in resolution
1546 (2004), which set down the foundation for the
political process in Iraq. We pledge the continued
adherence of the Iraqi Government to the political
process prescribed by the Council. Iraq has fulfilled its
obligations at every stage in the transitional process
and we look forward now to country-wide elections on
15 December under a Constitution that was approved
by the great majority of the Iraqi people.

It is very important for the international
community that this process be successful. Failure
would be too awful to contemplate and would represent
a threat to regional and international peace. The Iraqi
people are in no way contemplating failure. They are
determined, and they will go forward with the process.

With such clear and unequivocal support from the
international community for the political transition, we
will go forward with redoubled effort and confidence
to complete our journey towards peace and prosperity
in Iraq and to defeat terrorism in our country.
