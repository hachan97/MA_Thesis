Mr. Le Roy (spoke in French): I would just like
to thank you, Mr. President, for having organized this
debate. I believe it has been very productive and that
every statement has been very useful for each of us -
for both the Security Council and of course for us in
the Secretariat's Departments of Peacekeeping
Operations and Field Support. I think that we entirely
share the idea that peacebuilding activities should
begin as soon as possible in the context of
peacekeeping efforts, as we have very clearly said in
the New Horizon study. I also think that today's debate
validates everything we proposed in that study. It is for
us to make use of all the integration tools at our
disposal - such as the Integrated Mission Task Force,
the integrated mission planning process and the
integrated strategic framework - to ensure that the
whole host of peacebuilding activities are integrated as
soon as possible into peacekeeping efforts. I think that
there is consensus on this. Once again, we proposed it
in the New Horizon paper, and we are very pleased to
take note of today's consensus. Thank you, Mr. President,
for making this debate possible.
