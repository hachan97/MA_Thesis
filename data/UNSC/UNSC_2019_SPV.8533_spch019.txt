Mr. Pecsteen de Buytswerve (Belgium) (spoke in French): I would first like to thank all the speakers for
their briefings.

Despite the fact that Somalia is going through
difficulties, we should also acknowledge the positive
developments there and the efforts that have been
undertaken. For example, we can probably call the
meeting held in Garowe from 4 to 12 May between
the Federal President and the regional presidents
encouraging even if the hoped-for results have not yet
been materialized. I salute President Farmajo for his
commitment to resuming dialogue and encourage him
to follow up on the Garowe meeting as soon as possible.
The report ofthe Secretary-General (see S/2019/393) lists
other positive points, such as the Federal Government's
commitment to economic reforms and the biometric
registration of Somali National Army troops.

Since Belgium is also a federal country I cannot
overemphasize the importance of maintaining close and
constructive relations between the Federal Government
and the federal authorities. That kind of cooperation
is crucial to making federalism an effective system
that can address the needs of citizens in a framework
of good-faith dialogue among the various levels of
governance. Unfortunately, electoral issues remain a
source of discord and tension. The elections in Jubaland
are rapidly approaching, and we must therefore be
particularly watchful.

The Somali National Army has decided to launch
operations to secure the Lower Shabelle region, which
should be accompanied by stabilization measures. I
welcome the creation of an interministerial task force
to prepare for that, and I would be interested in having
more information on the next steps. The scope of
international support for Somalia is remarkable, but we
must ensure that the support provided is coordinated
and transparent, particularly with regard to bilateral
cooperation programmes. It is essential for all partners
of Somalia to work together to the same purpose.
