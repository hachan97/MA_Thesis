Mr. Matulay (Slovakia): My delegation decided
to abstain in the vote on the draft resolution on the
situation in the Middle East (S/2006/878) as it stands
before the Security Council today.

Slovakia has expressed its deep concern at the
increased violence that has recently been taking place
in Gaza, and especially at the Israeli military
operations that have resulted in the death or injury of
dozens of Palestinian civilians, including children and
women, in Beit Hanoun. We express our deepest
condolences to the Palestinian people and to the
bereaved families. We strongly deplore any action that
causes such appalling civilian casualties and call on
Israel to undertake serious efforts to investigate this
tragic event.

We believe that all the initiatives of the Security
Council in the wider area of the Middle East are very
important and have a direct impact on the situation and
on future developments. In that sense, any action taken
by the Security Council should be considered very
carefully, with the aim of making a balanced appeal to
all parties and of achieving ajust and lasting peace.

In the process of drafting this draft resolution,
many comments and suggestions to improve and
balance the text were made by all Council members.
The text as it stands before us reflects most of the
views expressed during the deliberations. However, as
we said earlier, during the expert consultations, we had
wished for the inclusion of additional relevant
adjustments and modifications that would have
reflected all the complexities of the ongoing Israeli-
Palestinian dispute in a more accurate way. After
careful consideration, we regretfully decided to abstain
in the vote on the draft text as it was submitted to the
Security Council.
