The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Mr. Duarte for his statement.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers
to limit their statements to no more than five minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate the written text and to
deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.

I am pleased to welcome the presence in the
Council table of the Vice-President and Minister for
Foreign Affairs of Panama, His Excellency Mr. Samuel
Lewis-Navarro. I invite him to take the floor.
