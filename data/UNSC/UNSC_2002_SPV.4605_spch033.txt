The President: I thank the representative of
Ukraine for his kind words addressed to Bulgaria and
the Bulgarian team here in the United Nations.

The next speaker on my list is the representative
of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I
invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to
make his statement.
