Mr. Cardi (Italy): I thank you in particular,
Mr. President, for convening this meeting. My thanks
also go to Under-Secretary-General, Mr. Jeffrey
Feltman, and Ambassador Joanne Adamson for
their briefings.

Today, I will touch on three aspects of my report
covering the period from 16 June to 15 December
2017: first, the activities of the Council in the 2231
format; secondly, monitoring of the implementation of
resolution 2231 (2015); and thirdly, developments in the
Procurement Channel. The full version of the report
has been circulated to Council members and has been
issued under the symbol S/2017/1058.

On 23 June and 13 December, the Security Council
met in the 2231 format to review the findings and
recommendations contained in the third and fourth
reports (S/2017/515 and S/2017/1030) of the Secretary-
General on the implementation ofresolution 2231 (2015).
On 14 July, I held an open technical briefing to inform
Member States on the implementation of resolution
2231 (2015) and to enhance their understanding of
the opportunities and obligations inherent to it. The
Coordinator of the Procurement Working Group of the
Joint Commission and the Secretariat also participated
in the briefing. On 8 September, the Security Council
held a meeting in the 2231 format to discuss the 27 July
Simorgh space launch vehicle launched by the Islamic
Republic of Iran, and the various letters addressed to
the Security Council in that regard. I will summarize
our discussion in the second part of my briefing.

In line with paragraph 4 of the resolution, in August
and November the Director General of the International
Atomic Energy Agency submitted two quarterly
reports on verification and monitoring activities (see S/2017/777 and S/2017/994). In both quarterly reports,
the Agency affirmed that the Islamic Republic of Iran
had not pursued the construction of the existing Arak

heavy water research reactor based on its original
design, had no more than 130 metric tons ofheavy water,
had no more than 5,060 centrifuges that have remained
installed in 30 cascades at the Fuel Enrichment Plant
at Natanz, had not enriched uranium above 3.67 per
cent U-235, had not conducted any uranium enrichment
or related research and development activities at the
Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant; and that there had been
no nuclear material at the Plant.

In its November 2017 report, the Agency confirmed
that it continued its evaluations regarding the absence
of undeclared nuclear material and activities for the
Islamic Republic of Iran, including through the conduct
of complementary accesses under the Additional
Protocol to all the sites and locations in the Islamic
Republic of Iran which it needed to visit.

On 8 September, during a meeting in the 2231
format, the Security Council considered the Simorgh
space launch vehicle launch by Iran of 27 July. The
meeting's discussion evinced various views. Some
representatives considered the launch to be inconsistent
with resolution 2231 (2015), since the technology used
was similar to that of a ballistic missile, and that the
Simorgh, if configured as a missile, was "inherently
capable" of delivering nuclear weapons. Other Member
States noted that the Simorgh was not designed and
could not be modified to deliver nuclear weapons, and
that the language in resolution 2231 (2015) contained
a call to refrain from but not to ban ballistic activities.

During the reporting period, three Member States
sent communications to the Security Council alleging
transfer and activities by Iran that fell under the
restrictions provided for by resolution 2231 (2015).
Those are listed in detail in my report, together with
all the replies received from the Iranian Mission to the
United Nations. Since implementation day, a total of 24
proposals to participate in or permit activities set forth
in paragraph 2 of annex B to resolution 2231 (2015)
have been submitted to the Security Council by four
Member States from three different regional groups,
including States that are not participants in the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The continued
submission of nuclear-related proposals to the Security
Council shows the steady confidence of Member States
in the Procurement Channel. I am also pleased to note
that, on average, the proposals were processed through
the Procurement Channel in fewer than 49 days.

On 1 August, the Security Council updated the list
of items, materials, equipment, goods and technology

whose supply, sale or transfer to Iran requires approval
in advance, on a case-by-case, basis by the Security
Council, in accordance with paragraph 2 of annex B to
resolution 2231 (2015).

As we approach the second anniversary of
implementation day, transparency, practical guidance
and outreach remain a priority. In that regard, the open
briefing for Member States on the implementation of
resolution 2231 (2015), held on 14 July, was one of the
many efforts to raise awareness, with a focus on the
Procurement Channel.

Finally, since this is my third and last report on
the implementation of resolution 2231 (2015), and I am
of course approaching the end of my annual mandate
as Facilitator, allow me to conclude by saying that I
am confident that the international community will
continue to act in line with paragraph 2 of resolution
2231 (2015), which calls upon all Member States,
regional organizations and international organizations
to take such actions as may be appropriate to support
the implementation of the JCPOA.
