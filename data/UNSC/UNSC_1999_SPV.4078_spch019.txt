The President: I am grateful to Mr. Miyet for his
answers and observations, which were, as always,
comprehensive and acute. This has been an important and
interesting meeting on the subject. This is a critical
operation of the United Nations in Africa; we must get it
right, and the Security Council will want to work closely
with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, in
particular, in getting it right.
