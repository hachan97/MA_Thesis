The President (spoke in Spanish): I will now take
the floor in my national capacity.

Peru welcomes the adoption of resolution 2410
(2018), extending the mandate of the United Nations
Mission for Justice Support in Haiti (MINUJUSTH)
for an additional year and laying the foundation for
the transition towards a normalization of the United
Nations presence in the post-peacekeeping period. In
that regard, we place our trust in the important work
being carried out by the Mission in support of the
Haitian Government in strengthening the rule of law,
professionalizing the police force and monitoring the
human rights situation.

We also believe that efforts in those areas should
be aimed at achieving the objectives identified by the
Secretary-General, which establish a road map for
stability, security and prosperity in Haiti. Despite the
lack of unanimity on resolution 2410 (2018), which we
have just adopted, we feel it is important to uphold the
commitment that we know exists among all members
of the Council with regard to the need to continue
to support Haiti. We cannot lose sight of the fact
that the responsibility of the Council is larger than
the mandate established for this Mission. We must
contribute to building a dynamic relationship of mutual
trust between the Government of Haiti and the United
Nations in general.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Haiti.
