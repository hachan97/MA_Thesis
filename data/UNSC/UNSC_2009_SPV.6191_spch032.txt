The President: There are no other speakers
inscribed on my list.

I want to thank all the participants for their
contributions to this meeting. My thanks go
particularly to all the distinguished heads of State and
Government, the Secretary-General and the Director
General of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
The statements that we heard today, I think, affirm our
commitment to a difficult but achievable goal.

I am inspired and encouraged by the seriousness
with which all of you have approached this question. I
am extraordinarily encouraged by the unanimous
adoption of the resolution. Words alone will not get the
job done, but with our having affirmed our stated goal,
I am confident that if we are diligent we can in fact
move this process forward and provide the sort of
peace and security for our children and our
grandchildren that all of us so desperately want.

I want to thank all of you, again, for your
participation.

The meeting rose at 11.20 am.
