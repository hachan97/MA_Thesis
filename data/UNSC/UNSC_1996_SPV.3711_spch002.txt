Ms. Bali (Director of the Security Council Affairs Division): The draft annual report of the Security Council
for the period 16 June 1995 to 15 June 1996, to be
submitted to the General Assembly of the United Nations
in pursuance of paragraph 3 of Article 24 and paragraph 1
of Article 15 of the United Nations Charter, has been
prepared by the Secretariat in line with the revised format
agreed upon by the Security Council in 1974 and further
revised in 1985, 1993, 1994 and 1995.

 

The present format of the draft report before the
Council provides a useful guide to the activities of the
Council in a concise manner. As requested by the
Security Council and as in the case of the last report, it
contains in its introduction more information about the
work of each of the sanctions committees than previously.

The draft report was circulated by the Under-
Secretary-General for Political Affairs on 5 November
1996 to the current members of the Security Council and
also to the five members whose terms of office expired
on 31 December 1995 - that is, Argentina, the Czech
Republic, Nigeria, Oman and Rwanda - for review and
comments, if any.
A corrigendum prepared by the Secretariat has been
circulated to the members of the Council. It sets out
corrections of a technical nature and in one case - that
is, with respect to Chapter 25 - adds a new paragraph to
the draft report.
