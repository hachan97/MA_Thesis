The President (spoke in French): I would ask
speakers to limit the length of their statements to
four minutes in order to enable the Council to carry
out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy
statements are kindly rquested to circulate the text
in writing and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking in the Chamber.

I give the floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
and Emigrants of Lebanon.
