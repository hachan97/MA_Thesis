The President (spoke in French): I thank the
representative of the Association of South-East Asian
Nations (ASEAN) for his kind words addressed to our
delegation.

Allow me to emphasize that the comparative
advantages the representative of ASEAN has just
mentioned are truly very important in our debate, as are
the annual meetings that ASEAN holds with the United
Nations. These are practical measures. I believe this is
a subject of interest to other regions as well.
