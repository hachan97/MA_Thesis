Mr. De La Sabliere (France) (spoke in French):
France deeply regrets the Security Council's inability
to adopt the draft resolution on Cyprus that was put to
the vote this evening. We regret that the draft
resolution was put to the vote in such conditions. We
should have preferred to continue consultations in
order to agree tonight on a briefer text acceptable to
all. Indeed, we should have wished the Council to take
more time so that it might yet again express itself
robustly and unanimously, as it did several days ago.

We fear that the signal could be misinterpreted.
However, the Council is unanimous with regard to
substance. My delegation therefore believes that if the
settlement plan is adopted during the referendums on
Saturday, the Council should immediately take the
necessary measures for its adoption. My country
supports the Secretary-General in that regard.

In conclusion, I would recall that France, like the
other countries of the European Union, has indicated
its preference that the island be unified when it accedes
to Union membership on 1 May.
