Mr. Buallay (Bahrain) (interpretation from Arabic):
My delegation congratulates you warmly, Sir, on your
assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for
the month of January. We are confident that your wisdom
and dynamism will enable the Council to achieve great
success in its work. My delegation thanks the Secretary-
General and his Special Representative, as well as all the
personnel of the United Nations Observer Mission in
Angola (MONUA), for their efforts to bring peace and
stability to Angola. We also convey our thanks and
appreciation to the countries of the troika - Portugal, the
Russian Federation and the United States of America -
and to all others that support the peace process in Angola.

The situation in Angola urgently needs strong
support and a full commitment by the two parties to the
conflict to achieve the reconciliation for which we have
been waiting all too long and to put an end to this long
conflict so that the "peace train" can move forward.
Given the current state of affairs, a United Nations
presence is important for the achievement of a final,
positive conclusion to this tragic situation. In the light of
the difficult humanitarian conditions that the conflict has
brought about for the Angolan people, it is urgent that life
in Angola return to normal. Unless the conflict comes to
an end, it will be most difficult to resettle displaced
persons and to provide basic, essential services -
notwithstanding the ongoing efforts of United Nations
specialized agencies.

My delegation will vote in favour of the draft
resolution before the Council today, because we believe
it is necessary to support peace and security in Angola.
The extension of the mandate of MONUA assumes a
genuine commitment by the two parties to respect their
obligations and to fulfil their peace obligations under the
new timetable approved by the Joint Commission.
