The President: I wish to express my sincere
thanks on behalf of my delegation and on my own
behalf to all present for the very gracious words and
expressions of appreciation for the work carried out
during the Mauritian presidency of the Security
Council.

We view presidencies not in isolation, but as a
continuous and succeeding exercise in the pursuit of
our goal. We are therefore very much comforted to
learn that Mexico will follow up on some of the very
important issues that we have discussed this month
relating to, for example, increasing transparency and
interaction with the non-members of the Security
Council.

I want to take this opportunity to thank those
from the larger United Nations membership, the non-
Council members who are here today. We do apologize
that we were not able to let everybody know that this
meeting had been postponed from this morning because
we were not able to conclude our consultations in time.
I do hope that next month the format will be changed
and we will be able to have greater interaction with
non-Council members and therefore get more
participation from them.

I would like to express once again our grateful
thanks to all the delegations on the Council for the
cooperation extended to us and for facilitating the
discharge of our responsibilities this month. We would
also like to express our deepest appreciation to the
Security Council secretariat, headed by Mr. Joseph
Stephanides, for the tremendous support. A particular
word of thanks to Mr. Aleksandar Martinovic and
Ms. Norma Chan for their support and cooperation.

Before I pass the baton to Mexico as they assume
the presidency for the month of February, we offer
them our very best wishes and wish them good luck for
a very successful presidency.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 5.25 p.m.
