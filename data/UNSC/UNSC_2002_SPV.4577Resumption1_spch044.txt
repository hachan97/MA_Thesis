Mr. Dieye: I just want to comment, Madam
President, on your concurrence with the need to have
the United Nations Office in West Africa play a lead
role. In that regard, I must say that we have anticipated
events by applying the lessons learned in Sierra Leone.
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
is funding the number-two post of the Office. That
shows that we will have two legs: a political leg and a
development leg. Thus, in a way, we are upscaling the
Sierra Leone model on the regional level. We are in a
way anticipating the lessons learned in that regard.

I believe this will help us move forward. Not only
will we be funding the number-two post; we will be
providing resources for the Office to do what some
speakers here have called vulnerability analysis and to,
as the Secretary-General said this morning, anticipate
crises. As I think the representative of Mauritius said,
an increase in the number of internally displaced
persons and refugees is a signal that a crisis is looming.
We are trying to have a battery of indicators that will
signal crises beforehand.

I am glad that you have focused on this issue,
Madam President. UNDP pledges itself to support this
process.
