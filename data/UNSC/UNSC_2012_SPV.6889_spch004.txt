Mr. DeLaurentis (United States of America): We
welcome the adoption of resolution 2081 (2012). We
would like to reiterate what we said during the Council's
meeting on Tribunals on 5 December (see S/PV.6880).
The United States fully supports the International
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY)
and respects its rulings. We support the ongoing
managerial steps taken by the Tribunal under the
leadership of President Meron to improve its efficiency
across the board and to facilitate the transition to the
Residual Mechanism. In that regard, we also note that
the only two ICTY trials that will not be completed by
the requested date of 31 December 2014, as set forth
in resolution 1966 (2010), are those major proceedings
resulting from the arrests of Mladie and Hadiie. The
arrests occurred last year after the adoption of that
resolution.

We join others on the Council in the ongoing effort
to support the Tribunal to complete its critical mandate
in the most expedient way possible, consistent with the
requirements of the international judicial process.
