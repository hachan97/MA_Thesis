The President: I thank the representative of Cyprus
for his kind words addressed to me.

I also thank him for staying well within the five-
minute recommendation, as I should have likewise thanked
the representative of New Zealand.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Nigeria. I invite him to take a seat at the
Council table and to make his statement.
