Mr. Musayev (Azerbaijan): Azerbaijan is deeply
concerned at the continuing crisis and widespread
Violence in Syria that have resulted in the death of
many people. Despite the repeated calls of the
international community, the situation in Syria
continues to deteriorate, causing scores of deaths and
injuries. Azerbaijan has from the very beginning
supported the efforts of the League of Arab States, and
is looking forward to their continuation with a view to
ending the Violence, overcoming the crisis and finding
a solution by peaceful means and through dialogue.

The only solution to the crisis in Syria is through
an inclusive and Syrian-led political process with the
aim of effectively addressing the legitimate aspirations
and concerns of Syria's people, without external
interference. This understanding is clearly expressed in
the draft resolution (S/2012/77). It is crucial that
obligations with respect to the sovereignty, territorial
integrity and political independence of Syria and all
other States of the region be fully observed and
respected. It is important that the draft resolution
emphasizes that the current political crisis in Syria
must be resolved peacefully, and notes that nothing
authorizes measures under Article 42 of the United
Nations Charter.

Azerbaijan supported the draft resolution on the
aforementioned understanding and with the hope that
its adoption would contribute to ongoing efforts aimed
at encouraging dialogue, overcoming the crisis and
putting an end to human suffering.
