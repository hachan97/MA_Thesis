Mr. Olguin Cigarroa (Chile) (spoke in Spanish):
We thank Ambassador Roman Oyarzun Marchesi for
introducing the quarterly report on the work of the
Security Council Committee established pursuant
to resolution 1737 (2006). We also thank the Panel of
Experts and its Coordinator for the presentation to the
Committee on 1 June of its final report (S/2015/401, annex).

As we have noted previously, Chile has always
attached great importance to the work of the
non-proliferation Committee, whose sanctions regime
remains fully in force.

Like other speakers, we continue to follow the
negotiations currently under way between the E3+3
and Iran. In both the Security Council and the 1737
Committee, Chile has promoted a positive atmosphere
conducive to the negotiations.

At this historic juncture, we call on the parties
to demonstrate flexibility and responsibility at the
international level. An eventual agreement would benefit
the non-proliferation regime and provide assurance
to the international community as to the exclusively
peaceful role of the Iranian nuclear programme.

We urge Iran to continue cooperation with the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Chile
takes note of the latest report on the implementation of
the safeguards agreement in connection with the Treaty
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the
relevant provisions of Security Council resolutions
on Iran. We appreciate the support of the IAEA in the
monitoring and verification of the voluntary measures
referred to in the Joint Action Plan.

In conclusion, Chile considers that the current
negotiations send an encouraging message about
the value of diplomacy in resolving conflicts. We
hope that the E3+3 and Iran will promptly achieve a
comprehensive and verifiable agreement.
