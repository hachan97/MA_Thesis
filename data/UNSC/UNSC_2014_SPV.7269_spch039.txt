Ms. Murmokaite (Lithuania): As I was listening to
the representatives of the countries affected, what struck
me basically was that every single country affected that
has lost its citizens and whose people are waiting for
justice and closure has expressed its full support for the
Netherlands-led investigation. Not a single country has
raised doubts about that investigation or claimed that
its integrity is flawed. Therefore, I find it extremely
surprising that countries that have very direct stakes
in the investigation are satisfied with its course, while
somebody who has no stake in the investigation or
seemingly no stake in the investigation is spreading
doubts and openly questioning the credibility and
integrity of the investigation. That probably says
something about their true motives, but I will not
speculate on those motives. I think we have to be very
careful, honestly speaking, about how we proceed with
the debate.

Behind the investigation, we have real people, real
names. We have those who have lost their dear ones.
They want clarity, they want closure. They want justice.
Obfuscations and claims that the investigation is flawed
and that there has to be another investigation and that
there has to be assistance hurts those people and puts
them in doubt. That is not what we, as the Council, can
allow. We should not add additional grief to those who
already lost their dear ones.

Therefore, I think that any speculation on the
process and on the credibility of the investigation and
attempts to raise additional questions and establish
additional structures, which will encumber the process,
is, as our German colleague said when speaking about
something else, "a slap in the face". It is damaging to
the memory of the people and to the course ofjustice.
And justice, I think, is what we all want in this case.
