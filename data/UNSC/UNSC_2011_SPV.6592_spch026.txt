Lieutenant-General Nyamvumba: Two questions
were posed to me, one by the representative of the
United States and the other by the representative of
Lebanon.

The United States question was whether we could
share our experience with other missions. Indeed, that
is very relevant, and part of the purpose of our
gathering here in New York is, among others, to share
our experiences from different missions. But besides
that, we also have a forum, particularly what we refer
to as inter-mission cooperation. I express my
appreciation to General Prakash, who hosted our
regional Force Commanders' meeting in Entebbe in
May. We will take note of this and will continue to
share our experiences with other missions, particularly
those that have a protection of civilians mandate. We
also welcome other experiences from other missions.

On the issue of the major logistical challenges
facing the African Union-United Nations Hybrid
Operation in Darfur (UNAMID), I did outline some of
them, but, to be more specific, one is the long supply
lines. All present are aware that the major seaport is in
Port Sudan, which is about 2,000 kilometres from
Darfur, with little or no infrastructure. In terms of our

operations, the biggest hurdle is the lack of
infrastructure on the ground. During the rainy season,
as I said earlier, our patrols and our activities actually
drop drastically because of the inaccessibility of areas.
Even as I speak, we have dropped from 160 daily
patrols to about 100 because of the impassability of
roads.

Finally, there is the issue of aviation capacity.
There is still a very big gap with regard to utility
helicopters. I will take this opportunity to appeal to
those that have the means to support the mission to
make some of those capacities available, because,
indeed, they go a long way towards enhancing the
capabilities of the mission.
