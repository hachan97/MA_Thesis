behalf of all members of the Security Council to bid
farewell to Mrs. Neylan Bali, Director of the Security
Council Affairs Division and Secretary of the Council, as
she leaves the Secretariat after many years of dedicated
and distinguished service. The members of the Council,
and especially the President of the Council, have
benefited greatly from her efficiency, knowledge and
advice over the years in connection with the many
delicate and critical matters with which the Council is
called upon to deal. We shall miss her. On behalf of the
members of the Council, I extend best wishes to her in
her future endeavours.

May I also express my thanks to colleagues on the
Council for the cooperation they have unfailingly given to
me and the members of my delegation throughout the
Malaysian presidency.
