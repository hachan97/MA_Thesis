Mrs. ngu (Nigeria): One year ago, the Security
Council unanimously adopted resolution 2166 (2014).
The resolution calls for an investigation into the downing
of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 in accordance
with international civil aviation guidelines. Most
significantly, the resolution calls for accountability,
transparency and justice for the victims. It is for those
reasons that Nigeria voted in favour of draft resolution
S/2015/562, which the Council has just considered.
Had it been adopted, the draft resolution would have
authorized the establishment of an international
criminal tribunal to ascertain culpability for the crash
as a precursor to prosecution and trial.

The establishment of the tribunal would not only
have brought justice to the victims and closure to their
families, it would also have sent a strong message that
the international community will not tolerate any act
that threatens the safety of international civil aviation.
We regret that the draft resolution was not adopted.
Indeed, that brings to the fore once again the need
for the Council to cultivate the practice of adopting
a unified stance on matters requiring leadership in
pursuit of international peace and security.
