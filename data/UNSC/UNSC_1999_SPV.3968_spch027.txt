Mr. Burleigh (United States of America): I just
wanted to make a brief comment. Excuse me for taking
the floor twice, but I thought that several of the
interventions today have been extremely interesting and
thought-provoking - in particular your comments just

 

now, Sir, but also issues raised earlier by Ambassador
Lavrov and then commented on, in one way or another, by
Ambassadors Turk, Greenstock and Dej ammet and again by
yourself.

There is one aspect of them that I should just like to
note for the record, because it is a subject that has come up
repeatedly in the Council and which I think you, Sir, were
alluding to again. I would describe it as the question of the
use and misuse of the sovereignty concept. I am just
throwing this out for possible future discussion among
Council colleagues, because I know it is controversial and
a very difficult issue.
It is my Government's view that there are
circumstances - such as the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo
this past fall and currently looming, or the repression of the
civilian population in Iraq - in which the international
community should and must be willing to act to protect
civilians against the depredations of their own
Governments. It is sad but true that the sovereignty
arguments can be used and sometimes have the practical
result of finding excuses for repressive, even murderous
Governments which are engaging in gross violations of the
human rights of their own citizens. These arguments also
often lead to the incapacitation of the international
community, as you alluded to just now, Sir.

We do not believe that such extreme examples of
Governments' mistreatment of their own populations should
be tolerated.
