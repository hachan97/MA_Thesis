Mr. Heusgen (Germany): Very briefly, I would
like to thank both the Palestinian and the Israeli
representatives for partially responding to my request
to put aside their speaking notes, but I regret the fact
that neither of them responded to the questions that I
put. Can the representative of Palestine not say how the
Palestinian Government plans to stop the incitement,
provocations and inflammatory rhetoric? What is it
doing to stop rockets falling on the Israelis. I did not
hear once from our Israeli colleague how Israel wants to
implement to resolution 2334 (2016) with regard to the
settlements or what Israel plans to do so that the crisis
that we read about Al-Haram Al-Sharif is stopped and
it negotiates with the Jordanians. Both representatives
said basically the same. The Israeli representative said,
as I understand, that as long as the children in his city
or village where he grew up cannot sleep in peace and
be safe from Palestinian Hamas rockets, he cannot
respond to the issue of implementing resolution 2334
(2016). The Palestinian representative said the same
thing: as long as Palestinian children cannot be sure
that the next morning when they wake up there will not
be bulldozers in front of their house to tear it down, he
must read out his statement.

We therefore did not make progress on substance,
but I wanted to take up the proposal of the Israeli
representative. In view of the German part of the joint
German-French presidencies, I am very happy to pick
up with my colleagues his idea of having an informal
meeting of Security Council members with the Israeli
and Palestinian representatives behind closed doors so
that we can perhaps prolong the debate.
