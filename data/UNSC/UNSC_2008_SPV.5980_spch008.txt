The President (spoke in French): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as representative of
Burkina Faso.

I should like to thank Mr. Javier Solana for
having briefed the Security Council on the activities of
the European Union military operation in Chad and the
Central African Republic. The information that he
provided is all the more important and useful because
the mandate of the European Union-led peacekeeping
force (EUFOR) is coming to an end on 15 March 2009.
In that regard, the Council must be proactive and find
the means to capitalize on EUFOR's accomplishments
at a time when the political and security situation
remains worrisome in Chad, the Central African
Republic and the entire subregion.

We should like to commend the partnership that
EUFOR has established with the United Nations
Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad

(MINURCAT) under the mandate entrusted to it in
resolution 1778 (2007). For this partnership to bear
fruit, it is necessary and urgent to ensure the effective
deployment of MINURCAT in order to adequately
respond to the increasingly precarious security and
humanitarian situation in eastern Chad and the north-
eastern Central African Republic.

We look forward with interest to the Secretary-
General's assessment of the possible options for the
size, structure and mandate of the United Nations
military presence aimed at strengthening EUFOR.

To conclude, we thank once again all the
countries contributing contingents to EUFOR and we
urge them to continue their support to Chad and the
Central African Republic in order to restore lasting
peace and stability there.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 3.10 17.111.
