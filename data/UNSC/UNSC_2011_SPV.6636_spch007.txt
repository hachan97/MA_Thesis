The President: I wish to remind all speakers to
limit their statements to no more than four minutes in
order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate the text in writing and to
deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.

I now invite the Permanent Representative of the
United States of America and Member of President
Obama's Cabinet, Her Excellency Ms. Susan Rice to
take the floor.
