Mr. Lacroix (France) (spoke in French): France
voted in favour of this technical renewal in order to
respond to the official request of the Government of
Iraq for a one-year extension of the mandate of the
Multinational Force in Iraq. On this occasion, my
delegation would like to express its concern with
respect to the worsening security situation and also to
recall that we all share the same objective, which is to
help Iraq into the civil war that threatens it and to
recover the stability that it aspires to.

As the President of the French Republic has
declared, the French authorities have always believed
that offering a clear horizon for the withdrawal of
foreign troops would make it possible to send the
message that the objective of the international
community is that of restoring the sovereignty of Iraq.
My delegation is pleased to note that the resolution
integrates explicitly this prospect of withdrawal that
would come under the sovereign decision of Iraq.

The French delegation would like to stress that
the presence of the Multinational Force in Iraq is
supporting a political transition process whose success
depends on the involvement of the power of all of the
components of Iraq. In this perspective, France hopes
that the progress in the national inter-Iraqi dialogue
seen in the meetings in Sharm al-Sheikh in November
2004 and then in Cairo in November 2005 will
continue with the support of the countries in the region
and will soon lead to the organization of a national
reconciliation conference for Iraq.
