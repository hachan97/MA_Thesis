Mr. Heusgen (Germany): I heard the pleas from
both the Ukrainian Ambassador and our Russian
colleague - at length - to consider the 4 million people
in Donbas. To hark back to what some of our briefers,
particularly on humanitarian issues, said earlier, why is
it not possible to do something practical and, after this
meeting, send a message home and say that tomorrow in
the Trilateral Contact Group, with Ambassador Sajdik,
they are determined to work on fixing the bridge in
Stanytsia Luhanska. If they could do just that one
thing - engage there and get the bridge done, which
I believe the International Committee of the Red Cross
is ready to do it immediately - and demonstrate some
political commitment and compassion for the people,
we really will have achieved something during these
three hours.
