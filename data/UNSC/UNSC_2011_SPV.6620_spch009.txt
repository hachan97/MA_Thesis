Mr. Barbalic' (Bosnia and Herzegovina): We
welcome the establishment of the United Nations
Support Mission in Libya, under the leadership of a
special representative of the Secretary-General, for an
initial period of three months with a mandate set out in
resolution 2009 (2011).

The Libyan people have sought a change in their
country, and their legitimate aspirations to a more
democratic society are being realized. This has turned
out to be a historic year for the brave people of Libya.
Bosnia and Herzegovina believes that resolution 2009
(2011) is an important and necessary element of
economic recovery, reconstruction and the
normalization of the living conditions in Libya. It is
time for Libya to move forward and restore its political
and economic life and to promote national
reconciliation.
