I would like to welcome the presence of Ambassador Omer Mohamed Ahmed Siddig, Permanent Representative of the Republic of the Sudan, at this meeting. We take note of the work of Ms. Fatou Bensouda, Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), as reflected in her report and briefing. Viet Nam maintains its previously stated position regarding the Sudan. Additionally, we welcome the recent positive developments in the country. We commend the efforts of the transitional Government in promoting peace, stability and development in the Sudan in general and in Darfur in particular, as well as in responding to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We welcome the establishment of the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in the Sudan (UNITAMS), which will better support the Sudan in the light of the new realities. We once again emphasize the importance of UNITAMS carrying out its mandate on the basis of respecting the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Sudan, in close consultation and cooperation with the host Government. Our position remains that the State has the primary responsibility for the implementation of international humanitarian law and the prevention and suppression of serious criminal acts, especially genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. We hope that the Government of the Sudan will take the appropriate measures in resolving issues related to serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. The prevention and suppression of serious criminal acts should be conducted in accordance with the fundamental principles of international law, including those relating to a State's independence and sovereignty.
