Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
As previous speakers have covered many of the points
I had intended to cover, I shall refrain from repeating
them and shall be brief.

At the outset, I should like to thank Mr. Oshima
for his very detailed briefing. We wish to express our
appreciation for what he has accomplished on behalf of
the protection of civilians in armed conflicts.

The protection of civilians involves efforts on
many fronts. The international community and the
relevant United Nations agencies should work together
in synergy, enhancing their cooperation in various
fields, to help innocent civilians in armed conflicts to
have access to food, drinking water, medicine and other
humanitarian assistance and to help refugees and
internally displaced persons to return to their homes as
swiftly as possible so that they can resume their normal
lives, thus minimizing the harm inflicted on them by
war and violence.

We are pleased to note that the relevant
recommendations contained in the Secretary-General's
report (S/2002/1300) are being implemented, and we
hope that the relevant United Nations agencies will
finalize the road map for the protection of civilians in
armed conflict and will agree on time frames for the
completion of responsibilities and on the division of
labour among those agencies.
