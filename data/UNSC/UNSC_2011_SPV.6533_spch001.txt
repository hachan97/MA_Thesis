The President (spoke in French): Under rule 39
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite
Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno, Chair of the Senior
Advisory Group for the Review of International
Civilian Capacities; Ms. Susana Malcorra, Under-
Secretary-General for Field Support; and Mr. Eugene-
Richard Gasana, Permanent Representative of Rwanda,
in his capacity as Chairperson of the Peacebuilding
Commission, to participate in this meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document 8/2011/85, which contains the text of a
letter dated 18 February 2011 from the Secretary-
General addressed to the President of the Security
Council transmitting the report of the independent
review on civilian capacity in the aftermath of conflict.

I now give the floor to Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno.
