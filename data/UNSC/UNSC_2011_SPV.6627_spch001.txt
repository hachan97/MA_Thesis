take this opportunity to pay tribute, on behalf of the
Council, to His Excellency Mr. Nawaf Salam,
Permanent Representative of Lebanon, for his service
as President of the Security Council for the month of
September 2011. I am sure I speak for all members of
the Council in expressing deep appreciation to
Ambassador Salam and his delegation for the great
diplomatic skill with which they conducted the
Council's business last month.
