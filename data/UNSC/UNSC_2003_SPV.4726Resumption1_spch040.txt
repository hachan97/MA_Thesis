Mr. Baialinov (Kyrgyzstan) (spoke in Russian): I
would like to read out the text of the statement issued
by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Kyrgyzstan with
regard to the item on today's agenda:

"Due to the initiation of hostilities in Iraq,
the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the Kyrgyz
Republic would like to express its extreme
concern and regret over the fact that the Iraqi
problem has begun to be dealt with by the use of
force, bypassing decisions of the Security
Council of the United Nations, the primary
international body for collective security.

"I would like to point out that Kyrgyzstan
has always called for a political settlement of the
Iraqi problem, on the basis of the existing
relevant resolutions of the Security Council. In
the current circumstances, Kyrgyzstan deeply
regrets that the opportunity for a political
settlement has been missed. We nevertheless hope
that it will be possible to avoid civilian casualties
and the use of weapons of mass destruction.

"We would like to express the hope that the
consolidated efforts of the entire international
community will help avert a humanitarian crisis
in the area. We also hope that peace and stability
on Iraqi soil will soon be achieved, and that the
post-conflict reconstruction of Iraq will begin as
soon as possible.

"With regard to questions stemming from
the international anti-terrorism coalition's use of
the Ganci air base at Manas airport in connection
with hostilities in Iraq, we would again like to
point out that, while being fully aware of our
responsibilities, under agreements signed by
Kyrgyzstan with countries comprising that
coalition, the air base may be used only for the
purpose of ensuring the successful conduct of the
anti-terrorism operation in Afghanistan."
