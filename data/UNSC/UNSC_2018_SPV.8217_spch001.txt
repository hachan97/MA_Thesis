The President: In accordance with rule 37 of
the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite
the representative of the Syrian Arab Republic to
participate in this meeting.

In accordance with rule 39 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure, I invite Mr. Mark
Lowcock, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian
Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, to
participate in this meeting.

Mr. Lowcock is joining today's meeting via video-
teleconference from Geneva.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of the members of the
Council to document S/2018/243, which contains the
report of the Secretary-General on the implementation
of Security Council resolutions 2139 (2014), 2165
(2014), 2191 (2014), 2258 (2015), 2332 (2016) and 2393
(2017).

Recalling the latest note by the President of the
Security Council on its working methods (S/2017/507),
I want to encourage all participants, both members and
non-members of the Council, to deliver their statements
in five minutes or less. Note 507 also encourages
briefers to be succinct and focus on key issues. Briefers
are further encouraged to limit initial remarks to 15
minutes or less.

I now give the floor to Mr. Lowcock.
