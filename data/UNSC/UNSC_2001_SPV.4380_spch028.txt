The President (spoke in French): I thank Mr.
Calderisi most warmly for his brief but optimistic
comments which will better end our meeting.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council will remain seized of this matter.

The meeting rose at 7p.m.
