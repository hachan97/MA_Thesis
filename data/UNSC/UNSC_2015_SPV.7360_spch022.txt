The President (spoke in Spanish): I wish to remind
all speakers to limit their statements to no more than
four minutes in order to enable the Council to carry
out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy
statements are kindly requested to circulate the text
in writing and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking in the Chamber. I also appeal to speakers to
deliver their statements at a normal speed to so that the
Interpretation Service can carry out its work properly.

I wish to inform all those present that we will
continue the open debate through the lunch hour, as a
large number of speakers remains on the list.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Lebanon.
