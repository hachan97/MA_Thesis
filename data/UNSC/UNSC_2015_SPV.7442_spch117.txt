Ms. Bila (Ukraine): I would like to reply to
underscore the fact that Ukraine has fully complied
with the Minsk agreements, which is absolutely not
the case with the Russian Federation and the forces it
supports. However, that is not the issue we are dealing
with in this forum, where we are discussing small arms
and light weapons and their illegal transfer, including
to the territory of Ukraine. If anybody needs evidence
of this, the Ukrainian delegation is willing to provide
all the necessary photo evidence of the weapons that
were transferred to Ukraine from the stockpiles of the
Russian Federation. This is evidence of the Russian
Federation's influence and constant participation in the
conflict.
