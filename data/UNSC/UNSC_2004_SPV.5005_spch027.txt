Mr. Siv (United States of America): The Security
Council's mission to West Africa was my first visit to
the region in five years. I was again struck on the one
hand by its enormous potential, with its mineral
resources, rich agricultural lands and proud lineage,
and, on the other, by its enormous vulnerability and
institutional weakness.

The Security Council, the African Union, the
Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), key regional leaders and troop-
contributing countries have made an enormous
investment in the nations of West Africa, especially in
those that host peacekeeping operations. That
investment helps to restore and preserve stability in the
region and must be safeguarded. We must move from
lip service about the regional dimension of many of
West Africa's problems to concrete efforts to
coordinate peacekeeping operations and disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration programmes.

The Council mission underscored, for me, the
importance of geography and the ease with which
weapons, mercenaries, displaced populations and
destabilizing elements can move across borders. The
international community needs to respond to those
challenges and assist national Governments to address
them as well, if the responses are to be sustainable.

I salute Ambassador Emyr Jones Parry for his
outstanding leadership of the mission.
