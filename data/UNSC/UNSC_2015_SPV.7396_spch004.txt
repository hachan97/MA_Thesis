Mr. Sarki (Nigeria): Allow me first of all,
Mr. President, to congratulate your delegation on its
assumption of the presidency of the Council for this
month. We sincerely look forward to working with you
constructively towards the attainment of the programme
of work that was unanimously adopted today.

We also wish to thank and commend the delegation
of China for the leadership it gave to the Council in the
month of February.

As we speak today, we are cognizant of the
unanimous adoption of resolution 2206 (2015) by the
Council. Our quest for peace and stability in South
Sudan informed our decision to vote in favour of the
resolution. We believe that the resolution addresses all
the critical elements and issues that are impeding the
return of the country to a state of normalcy. We expect
it to send a strong message about the need for progress
towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict in South
Sudan. We stress once again that a military solution to
the conflict is unattainable. Only a negotiated solution
will bring lasting peace, stability and security to South
Sudan.

African leaders are not standing by while the
situation in South Sudan continues to deteriorate.
The Prime Minister of Ethiopia and Chair of the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)
has met with the leaders of South Sudan, and in his
remark, he made a very forceful observation that the
world cannot stand by while the country continues to
suffer.

Nigeria is encouraged therefore by the decision of
His Excellency President Salva Kiir and of Mr. Riek
Machar to engage in direct peace talks in Addis
Ababa. We strongly urge both leaders to build on
the progress made thus far in the IGAD-led peace
process by demonstrating the political will to resolve
all outstanding issues. We believe that a negotiated
solution is within reach, and we look forward to a
positive outcome from their talks, as the deadline of
5 March was agreed upon.
