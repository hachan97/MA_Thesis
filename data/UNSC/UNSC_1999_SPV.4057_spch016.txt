Mr. Honningstad (Norway): Norway would like to
commend the sustained efforts of the Secretary-General
to find a comprehensive and internationally acceptable
solution to the question of East Timor and to pursue the
consultation process aimed at achieving the independence
of East Timor. We would also like to reiterate our high
appreciation for the dedication and courage of the United
Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) in the
implementation of its mandate.

We welcome the 19 October decision of the
Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly to declare as
void earlier decrees incorporating East Timor in
Indonesia. This decision is a significant step in the
orderly transfer of authority in East Timor to the United
Nations - as a transitional step on the way to full
independence for East Timor.

We remain concerned about the grave humanitarian
situation in both East and West Timor. Norway calls on
the Indonesian authorities to cooperate fully with
international humanitarian agencies to provide support for
East Timorese refugees in West Timor and to facilitate
the return to East Timor of those East Timorese in West
Timor and elsewhere in Indonesia wishing to return.

Norway welcomes the decision to be taken today by
the Security Council to establish the United Nations
Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET).
We are committed to participating in the financing of
UNTAET. Norway's commitment to support the people
of East Timor will continue beyond the immediate
humanitarian needs; we will also allocate development
assistance funds for reconstruction and longer-term
development needs.

The people of East Timor have taken the first steps
towards full independence. They deserve the full support
of the international community in this endeavour.
