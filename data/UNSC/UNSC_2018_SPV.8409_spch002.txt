Mrs. Haley (United States of America): I am
making this statement on behalf of the United States,
the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden and
the United Kingdom.

We stand united in opposing Russia's attempt to
discuss yesterday's serious escalation in the Kerch
Strait under an agenda item entitled "Violation of the
borders of the Russian Federation". We strongly support
Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within
its internationally recognized borders, extending to its
territorial waters. We want to express our deep concern
about the incident, which represents a dangerous
escalation and violation of international law. We look
forward to discussing Russia's provocation under the
appropriate agenda item. We therefore urge all Council
members to vote against the adoption of the agenda as
proposed by Russia.
