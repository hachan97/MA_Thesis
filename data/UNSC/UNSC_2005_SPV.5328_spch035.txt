Judge Pocar: Thank you, Mr. President, for
giving me the floor despite the lateness of the hour. I
would just like to say a few words. First, I wish to
express my deep gratitude to you and to the other
members of the Council for the kind words addressed
to me as the new President of the International
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY)
and for their statements of appreciation for the
activities of my predecessor, which I shall convey to
Judge Meron.

I am also most grateful to Council members for
the attention they have given to my report today, for
the support they have shown for our work and for their
valuable and interesting comments. I assure them that
their views and suggestions, as well as the concerns
that they have expressed in relation to the completion
strategy, will be taken into account by the judges in
their future activities.

I wish to stress in particular that I noted the
encouragement to continue to improve our efforts to
strengthen the capacity of the local judiciary. We will
certainly do so, because I am convinced that that is not
only essential if we are to comply with the completion
strategy, but also essential in carrying out the
reconciliation process through justice in the region.
When the Tribunal is closed, it is essential that the
local judiciary have full capacity to apply the rule of
law in the countries concerned.

I thank Council members once again for their
attention.
