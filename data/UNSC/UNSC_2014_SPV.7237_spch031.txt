Mr. Tshibanda N'tungamulongo (Democratic Republic of the Congo) (spoke in French): I said earlier
that the visit did finally take place and that the work
was mostly done, and that we should see some progress.
I would prefer to remain on that positive note. I do not
intend to engage in a polemic. What I said earlier was
just to establish the facts. Regrettably, I must say that
there are corrections to be made with regard to what
the Ambassador just said. The note verbale was sent
after an agreement was reached that the mission would
go there. There were exchanges between the various
officials, who requested confirmation through a note
verbale. Therefore, the agreement had already been
reached that the visit would take place.

The second thing is that, in the response, it was
not just a question of saying that they arrived too soon.
With regard to going to Rwanda, we have an Embassy,
which was supposed to play a key role in instructing
people on how they should fill out various forms, and
Embassy personnel was to be instructed by our envoys.
Therefore, supposing that the Government of Rwanda
was not prepared, for some unknown reason, regarding
the Mouvement du 23 mars before the meeting with our
envoys, their envoys could have started to work with
our Embassy.

In Rwanda's response, it asked us to go through
the Expanded Joint Verification Mechanism, which has
absolutely nothing to do with this process. Thanks to
the intervention of the Special Envoys, that request,
which had nothing to do with the process, was lifted,
and the people left and were able to do their work.

As I said, I do not want to insist on this; Ijust
wanted it to be understood that even though this was
done in Uganda, in Rwanda progress was not made on
that issue. That was not on account of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo. However, with that established,

I prefer to look to the future, rather than to dwell on
the past.
