Mr. Dejammet (France) (interpretation from French): I would like to read a communique issued this
evening by the French authorities, which is as follows:

"France deplores the chain of events that led to
the American military strikes against Iraq and the
serious human consequences that they may have for
the Iraqi population.

 

"It regrets that the Iraqi leaders were not able to
demonstrate the spirit of full cooperation called for by
the implementation of the Memorandum of
Understanding of 23 February 1998 between the
Secretary-General of the United Nations and Mr. Tariq
Aziz, which would have made possible the
comprehensive review of Iraqi disarmament provided
for in Security Council resolution 1194 (1998)."

I would like to thank the Secretary-General for the
statement that he issued this evening when faced with the
facts while the Security Council was holding consultations.
We have always supported the Secretary-General's tireless
and persistent actions to ensure that the law prevails,
despite the obstacles and pitfalls encountered.

The Secretary-General reminds us once again today,
a sad day for the United Nations, that the Organization's
duty will be to play its role.
