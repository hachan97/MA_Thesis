The President: I acknowledge the importance of
regional ownership and engagement in addressing
challenges to international peace and security. This
requires comprehensive approaches, transparency and a
great deal of cooperation with the United Nations and
with other regional organizations in a position to
provide expertise and support. Confidence can be
developed through genuine partnerships between the
United Nations and interested regional organizations,
as well as among regional organizations themselves.
