Mr. Lajcak: I would like to thank all members
of the Security Council for their statements and
expressions of support for our chairmanship-in-Office
and its priorities. It is very encouraging to us. I am
also grateful for their assessment of the state of play on
different issues and challenges in the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe. We have duly taken
good note of them and will use them in our future work.
They are very valuable to us. I am also grateful for the
interactive approach of the Ambassador of Germany,
and we will provide answers to his questions outside
the Chamber. I would like to wish Council members
every success in their work because that is what we all
need - the successful work of the Security Council.
I am very much looking forward to our cooperation
throughout our chairmanship.
