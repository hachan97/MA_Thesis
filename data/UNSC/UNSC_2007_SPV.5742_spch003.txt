Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese): In
accordance with the two resolutions we have just
adopted, Mr. Jallow will be reappointed as Prosecutor
of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda for
another four years and the mandate of Ms. Del Ponte as
the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal
for the former Yugoslavia will be extended for three
months. I would like to express our congratulations to
them.

In their respective work over the past few years,
the two Prosecutors have worked diligently. Faced with
the completion strategies of the two Tribunals, their
responsibilities will be more demanding. We hope that
the two Prosecutors will continue to strive for greater
efficiency, fairness and justice in their work.

With regard to the Prosecutor of the International
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the views
expressed by the representative of the Russian
Federation are understandable. However, given the fact
that the three-month extension is merely a transitional
arrangement, we are ready to respect the Secretary-
General's nomination. As the Tribunal is under the
pressure of time with regard to the completion strategy,
it is even more imperative that the Prosecutor press
ahead with the prosecution, while managing all the
work related to the transition. She is also expected to
cooperate in ensuring the success of the completion
strategy and to establish a solid groundwork for her
successor.
