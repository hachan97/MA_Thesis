Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese):
First of all, Mr. President, I thank you for your
introduction of the draft report. I also thank the
Secretariat for its efforts in preparing the report, and I
appreciate the statement made by Ambassador Burian a
moment ago.

All members of the Council had already reached
agreement on the draft report prior to this meeting, and
we look forward to its adoption by the Security
Council. Considering that the General Assembly will
07-56355
examine the report in early November, we hope that it
can be printed quickly, so as to give non-members of
the Council more time to read it.

As President of the Council in July, China was in
charge of drafting the report's introduction. During the
drafting process, all members of the Council made
valuable contributions, and the Secretariat also
provided assistance. China wishes to express its thanks
to all of them.

This process will have enabled the Security
Council to submit to the General Assembly a report
that is accurate, balanced and rich in information. We
hope that the report will also be conducive to
enhancing transparency in the work of the Security
Council.

With regard to the question of how to further
enhance the quality of the annual report in the future, I
share the views of Ambassador Burian and think that
this question should be one element for consideration
during the preparation of next year's report of the
Council. Taking into account past practice and the
07-56355
actual work of each year, and drawing upon our
collective wisdom, we should be able to find a way to
improve our work on the report. China is also willing
to share the experience we have gained in drafting the
introduction.

Finally, I propose that the Security Council adopt
the draft report.
