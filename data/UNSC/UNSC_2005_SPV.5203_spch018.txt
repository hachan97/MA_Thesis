Mr. Mercado (Philippines): We join others in
welcoming the Minister of Justice of Burundi. We
believe that his presence here underscores the
importance that his country attaches to ending
impunity, which we all know is the root of instability
in Burundi. We also thank Mr. Zacklin for his
comprehensive briefing.

Now that Burundi, after more than a decade of
civil war, is inching towards recovery, it is important
that the truth about past atrocities be revealed and that
the perpetrators be brought to justice. Learning the
truth about past human rights violations and punishing
those responsible for them are prerequisites for the
establishment of democracy and respect for the rule of
law.

We therefore welcome the innovative
recommendations of the assessment mission to create a
twin accountability mechanism - a national truth
commission comprising international and local
commissioners, and a special chamber within the
Burundi court system.

I should like to pose two questions to the Justice
Minister. The first relates to the composition of the
national truth commission. Considering the deep ethnic
divisions within Burundian society and the mutual
distrust between the two ethnic groups, may we have
his thoughts on the selection of the local
commissioners? Should it be the United Nations or the
Government of Burundi that selects such local
commissioners? Secondly, concerning the budget, we
believe that, whatever mode of financing is selected, it
should be sustained and viable.

On that point, may we know from the Minister
how long it is estimated that it would take the twin
mechanisms to accomplish their goals?
