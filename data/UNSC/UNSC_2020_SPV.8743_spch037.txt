The President (spoke in Chinese): There are still a number of speakers remaining on the list of speakers for this meeting. I will make sure that they have an opportunity to deliver their statements in the afternoon meeting. I would also like to reassure everyone that the statements made in the afternoon meeting will be as important as the ones made this morning, and that they will be considered on a par with this morning's statements in the follow-up actions of the Security Council. The meeting was suspended at 1.10 p.m.
