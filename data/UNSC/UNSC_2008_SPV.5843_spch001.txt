The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Australia, Brazil, Japan, New
Zealand, the Philippines, Portugal, Slovenia and
Timor-Leste, in which they request to be invited to
participate in the consideration of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Santos
(Timor-Leste) took a seat at the Council table.
The representatives of the other aforementioned
countries took the seats reserved for them at the
side of the Council Chamber.

The President (spoke in Spanish): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno, Under-Secretary-
General for Peacekeeping Operations.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Guehenno to take a seat at the
Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document 5/2008/26, which contains the report of the
2
Secretary-General on the United Nations Integrated
Mission in Timor-Leste.

At this meeting, the Council will hear a briefing
by Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno, Under-Secretary-
General for Peacekeeping Operations, to whom I now
give the floor.
