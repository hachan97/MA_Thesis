Mr. Rassoul (Afghanistan): I wish to thank all
members of the Council for their expressions of
sympathy and condolence on the martyrdom of
Mr. Rabbani. I would like also to report that a serious
investigation is being conducted to find out how the
assassination happened. Of course, when we have the
final results, we will notify the Council.

(spoke in French)

Allow me, on behalf of my people and
Government, to thank the members of the Council and
the representatives of the countries that are friends of
Afghanistan for their lasting support and commitment
to my country. With their support, Afghanistan will
play an essential role in the peace, stability and
prosperity of the region, and will contribute to global
peace and security.
