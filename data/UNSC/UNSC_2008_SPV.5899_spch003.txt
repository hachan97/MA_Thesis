The President: I thank Mr. Serry for his briefing,
which, as he said, was extensive. But I think the
situation on the ground has merited that. It was good
that, in contrast with some previous briefings we have
had, there were some positive elements to record as
well as negative ones.

In accordance with the understanding reached in
the Council's prior consultations, I now invite Council
members to informal consultations to continue our
discussion on the subject.

The meeting rose at 10:30 am.
