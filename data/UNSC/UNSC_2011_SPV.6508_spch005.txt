Mrs. Viotti (Brazil): Brazil is following with
great concern the deterioration of the situation in
Cote d'Ivoire. The escalation of violence throughout
the country and the increase in human rights violations
are unacceptable results of a protracted dispute. We
support the sending of a clear message from the
Security Council that all violence should immediately
stop.

Brazil strongly condemns all violence against
civilians, regardless of its origin. We urge all Ivorians
to exercise restraint. The authority of the United
Nations Operation in Cote d'Ivoire (UNOCI) must be
respected by all parties. Its personnel should be able to
fulfil UNOCI's mandate free of threat, attack and
restriction of movement. While implementing its
mandate to protect civilians, UNOCI must exercise
caution and impartiality so as not to become party to
the conflict.

Brazil continues to strongly support a political
process that promotes a negotiated settlement to the
crisis while upholding the will of the Ivorian people, as
reflected in the recent elections. The efforts of the
African Union and other regional actors in this regard
deserve our strong support. In that sense, we are
encouraged by the inclusion in resolution 1975 (2011),
adopted today, of provisions to emphasize the need to
pursue a political solution that preserves democracy
and peace in Cote d'Ivoire and promotes lasting
reconciliation among all Ivorians. More than ever,
preventing Cote d'Ivoire from relapsing into conflict
should be the Council's utmost priority.
