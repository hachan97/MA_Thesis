The President: I thank the representative of
Spain for his contribution, which was rich and dense. I
welcome his suggestions on a structured and
substantive dialogue and exchange of privileged
information between relevant players,
complementarity, subsidiarity and lack of rigidity. I
think he is very right to stress the need to seek a
flexible and tailor-made solution to each conflict.

It is now my great pleasure to call on our good
friend, the Chairman-in-Office of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, Mr. Solomon
Passy, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria, a
friendly neighbour of Romania. I am very happy that
he could make it and I am personally grateful to him
for taking the time to be with us.
