The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Nepal, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Acharya
(Nepal) took a seat at the Council table.

The President (spoke in Arabic): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Ms. Karin Landgren,
Representative of the Secretary-General and head of
the United Nations Mission in Nepal.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Ms. Landgren to take the seat reserved for
her at the Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2010/214, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the request of Nepal for United
Nations assistance in support of its peace process.
Members of the Council also have before them a letter
dated 5 May 2010 from the Secretary-General
2

transmitting a letter of the same date from the
Permanent Representative of Nepal to the United
Nations, which will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/2010/229.

At this meeting, the Council will hear a briefing
by Ms. Karin Landgren, to whom I give the floor.
