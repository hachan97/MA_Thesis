Mr. Diallo (Guinea) (spoke in French): On behalf
of my delegation, I would like to thank Deputy
President Zuma of South Africa for his very
comprehensive and relevant account of the situation in
Burundi, in his capacity as facilitator. We would also
like to thank the President of the Economic and Social
Council, who explained the role of that body in
strengthening peace in Burundi.

Remarkable progress has without a doubt been
made over the last year, and particularly in the past two
months in terms of a return to some normality in the
country. The African Union through its Mission and the
United Nations through its office in Bujumbura, along
with other partners, have all made their contribution to
this progress, but we must recognize there are still
dangers ahead that we must try to avoid. One of those,
and not the least important, is the reluctance, indeed
the refusal on the part of the Forces nationales de
liberation (FNL) of Agathon Rwasa to join the peace
process. In that connection, I would like to hear the
views of Deputy President Zuma about the best
approach for encouraging the FNL to change its
attitude. Indeed, in his statement he did address the
preconditions it has set to definitively join in the
process.

In conclusion, my delegation believes there is no
way to re-establish peace in Burundi without first
strengthening the presence of the African mission
there, with a View to replacing it quickly by a robust
and credible United Nations force.
