Mr. Mugoya (Uganda): My delegation voted in
favour of renewing the mandate of the United Nations
Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara
(MINURSO) for another year. But my delegation
remains concerned about a number of issues in the
human rights dimension raised in the report of the
Secretary-General (S/2009/200 and Corr.1).

We welcome the observation in that report that
the United Nations remains committed to upholding
international human rights standards. However, we see
MINURSO as the only contemporary peacekeeping
operation without a human rights component, contrary
to the general principles of the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations and its own mandate. We
therefore welcome the attention given in the resolution
to the importance of making progress on the human
dimension of the conflict. We call upon the parties to
work with Mr. Ross to ensure that observance of
09-31958
human rights in Western Sahara and refugee camps is
upheld.
