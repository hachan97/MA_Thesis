The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the
representative of the United Kingdom for his kind words
addressed to me.

I would like to remind the members of the Council
that, as we all know, Mr. Vieira de Mello has
appointments around noon. Therefore, I ask the
representatives to be as concise as possible.
