Mr. Shahril Effendi (Malaysia): Malaysia fully
shares the view that the Security Council should
undertake a comprehensive review of the
recommendations contained in the Brahimi Report on
improving the role of the United Nations peace
operations. In this regard, we wish to join previous
speakers in commending the Security Council Working
Group on the Brahimi Report, under the able guidance
and solid stewardship of Ambassador Curtis Ward of
Jamaica, for having completed its defined task in good
time.

We hope that the adoption by the Council today
of resolution 1327 (2000) will spur other organs and
bodies of this Organization to likewise complete their
deliberations on the areas under their purview as
regards the recommendations of the Panel.

We agree that the Security Council must do its
part to strengthen the United Nations peacekeeping
operations. Peacekeeping operations today, unlike in
the past, face a myriad of very different and difficult
circumstances and challenges. In order to implement
professionally and effectively Council decisions on
such operations, we must endeavour to equip such
missions with the necessary tools.

The current crisis in the United Nations Mission
in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) is a glaring example of
the urgent for all Member States, particularly those
with the greatest capacity and means, to contribute
troops to United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Ways must be found, and found quickly, to breach the
commitment gap.

Malaysia welcomes, among other things, the
Council's commitment to strengthen significantly the
existing system of consultations through the holding of
private meetings with troop-contributing countries. We
wish to see the early implementation of the decisions
and recommendations contained in the annex to the
resolution just adopted and support the Council's
decision to review periodically the implementation of
its provisions.
