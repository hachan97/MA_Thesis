Mr. Zlauvinen: I have the honour to inform the
members of the Security Council that the Director
General of the IAEA has transmitted today the work
programme of the IAEA, in accordance with paragraph
7 of Security Council resolution 1284 (1999).

As the Council can see, the work programme is
self-explanatory, and the Director General would be
available any time in the future to discuss with the
Security Council the IAEA's work programme should
the Council decide to do so.
