Mr. Burleigh (United States of America): I too
wanted just to add a few words. The draft resolution in
front of us, I think, is non-controversial, given its technical
nature. It was requested by one Council colleague that the
Council should consider at least taking this step of a brief
extension of the current phase of the oil-for-food
programme, and I think all are agreeable to doing that.

But this is just a brief interim step. The critical issue
here, in my Government's view, is that it is time now for
the Council as a whole to take up the Iraq issue
comprehensively. We think that a strong majority of the
Council is committed to a comprehensive approach, and I
would like to call on all Council colleagues to agree to a
maximal effort, along the lines of what Ambassador
Dejammet said earlier, to reach closure on a comprehensive
approach to the Iraq issue confronting the Council. I would
hope that that could be done in a short period of time.
