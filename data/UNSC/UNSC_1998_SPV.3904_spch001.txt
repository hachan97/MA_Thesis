The President (interpretation from Russian): In
accordance with the decisions taken at the 3900th meeting,
I invite the representative of Israel to take a seat at the
Council table; I invite the observer of Palestine to take a
seat at the Council table.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Gold (Israel)
took a seat at the Council table; Mr. Al-Kidwa
(Palestine) took a seat at the Council table.

The President (interpretation from Russian): The
Security Council will now resume its consideration of the
item on its agenda.

Following consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council has considered the letters
dated 18 and 22 June 1998 (8/1998/535 and S/1998/557), as well as the letters dated 8, 9 and 15
June 1998 (8/1998/481, 5/1998/487 and 5/1998/511)
from the Permanent Observer of Palestine to the
United Nations, and the letter dated 23 June 1998
(S/l998/558) from the Permanent Representative of
the Sudan to the United Nations on behalf of the
States members of the League of Arab States relating
to the issue of Jerusalem.

"The Security Council recognizes the importance
and sensitivity of the issue of Jerusalem to all parties
and expresses its support for the decision of the
Palestine Liberation Organization and the Government
of Israel, in accordance with the Declaration of
Principles of 13 September 1993, that the permanent
status negotiations shall cover the issue of
Jerusalem. The Council therefore calls upon the
parties to avoid actions which might prejudice the
outcome of these negotiations.
"In the context of its previous relevant
resolutions, the Security Council considers the
decision by the Government of Israel on 21 June
1998 to take steps to broaden the jurisdiction and
planning boundaries of Jerusalem a serious and
damaging development. The Council therefore calls
upon the Government of Israel not to proceed with
that decision and also not to take any other steps
which would prejudice the outcome of the
permanent status negotiations. Further, the Council
also calls upon Israel to abide scrupulously by its
legal obligations and responsibilities under the
Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of
Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August
1949.

"The Security Council supports the efforts of
the United States aimed at breaking the stalemate in
the peace process, calls upon the parties to respond
positively to these efforts, notes that the Palestinian
side has already given agreement in principle to the
United States proposals, and expresses the hope that
the permanent status negotiations can resume and
progress can be made towards the achievement of a
just, lasting and comprehensive peace based on
Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) of 22
November 1967 and 338 (1973) of 22 October 1973.

"The Security Council will keep Israeli actions
under review."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/1998/21.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.

The meeting rose at 11.10 pm.
