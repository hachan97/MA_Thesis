Ms. Wronecka (Poland): I would like to express
our gratitude to Germany, Indonesia and, in particular,
their experts on Afghanistan for their dedication and
professionalism shown during the negotiations.

We are witnessing new dynamics with regard to the
peace process in Afghanistan. That may bring a long-
awaited resolution to the conflict, which has caused
so much suffering to too many victims. Our intention
was to have all such aspects reflected in the resolution.
Poland voted in favour of resolution 2460 (2019) to
support an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned process.

Poland is a strong advocate of a global solution to
the challenges facing our planet due to climate change.
That also applies to Afghanistan, which has been
severely affected by desertification, among others. We
encourage the Government of Afghanistan to work
on adequate risk assessment and risk management
strategies in order to mitigate future threats to stability
and security.

I would like to conclude our explanation of vote
after the voting by reiterating our strong support for
Special Representative Yamamoto and the United
Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, as well as
for Afghanistan and its people.
