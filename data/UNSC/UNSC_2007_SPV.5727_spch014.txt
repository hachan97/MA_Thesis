Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): We too welcome the
presence of the Secretary-General at this meeting.

South Africa welcomes the unanimous adoption
of resolution 1769 (2007) deploying the first-ever
African Union/United Nations hybrid peacekeeping
operation. We commend the agreement of the Sudan
for the hybrid operation to be deployed in Darfur, as
detailed in the conclusions of the high-level African
Union/United Nations consultations with the
Government of the Sudan in Addis Ababa on 12 June
2007.

We also commend the efforts of the African
Union and the Government of the Sudan for the
successful deployment of the African Union Mission to
the Sudan (AMIS), as well as the efforts of Member
States and regional organizations that have assisted in
its deployment.

Resolution 1769 (2007) gives practical
expression to the partnership between the African
Union and the United Nations, which, we hope, will go

a long way in providing a strong basis for strengthened
cooperation between the two organizations. We believe
that the Darfur peace process provides the only
sustainable chance for the resolution of this conflict,
and we urge all parties to participate fully in the
mediation meeting soon to be held in Arusha. The
positive, forward-looking and constructive approach
and the momentum gained through this resolution
should be maintained as we embark on the challenging
task of bringing peace to Darfur.

We encourage the Secretary-General of the
United Nations and the Chairperson of the African
Union Commission to continue to provide leadership
and innovation to ensure that the hybrid force is
deployed as soon as possible.
