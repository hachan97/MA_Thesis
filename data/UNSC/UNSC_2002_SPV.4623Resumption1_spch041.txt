The President (spoke in French): I thank the
representative of Namibia for his kind words addressed
to me.

Before giving the floor to the next speaker, I
would like to inform members of the Council that it is
my intention to hold consultations at the ambassadorial
level following this meeting.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Senegal. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
