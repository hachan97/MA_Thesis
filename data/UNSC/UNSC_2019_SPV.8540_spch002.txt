Mr. Hickey (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom welcomes the adoption of resolution 2473
(2019). The Libyan arms embargo remains an important
tool of the Council and an integral part of our work to
help support the stabilization of Libya.

We are concerned by reports of weapons entering
Libya and take this opportunity to remind all Member
States of their obligations under resolution 1970 (2001).
We call on all parties involved in the Libyan crisis
to respect the arms embargo and to desist from any
actions that could further undermine the prospects for
United Nations-facilitated political dialogue. Any arms
entering Libya will only escalate the conflict and lessen
the prospects for a ceasefire.

Respect for the arms embargo is just one part of the
solution in Libya, which requires a full political dialogue
and reconciliation. We remain deeply concerned by
the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation
in Libya. The now protracted and escalating conflict
benefits no one and only serves to highlight the fact that
there can be no military solution to Libya's challenges.
The United Kingdom continues to call for all those
involved in the conflict to commit to an immediate
ceasefire, allow humanitarian access and return to
political talks.

We also reiterate our support for the tireless efforts
of Special Representative of the Secretary-General
Ghassan Salame and the United Nations Support
Mission in Libya to facilitate a return to political talks.
A United Nations-led political dialogue is the only way,
ultimately, to achieve the security and stability that
Libyans deserve.
