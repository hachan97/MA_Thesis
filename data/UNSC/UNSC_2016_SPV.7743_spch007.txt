Mr. Delattre (France) (spoke in French): France
welcomes the adoption of resolution 2298 (2016),
drafted by the Mission of the United Kingdom, which
we thank. It was the culmination of work conducted in
close cooperation with the Libyan authorities and the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
It also represents an important step in guaranteeing the
security of Libya and of the region, particularly with
regard to the risk posed by non-State actors. More
generally speaking, it is positive step forward for the
non-proliferation-of-chemical-weapons regime.

The meeting rose at 3.25 pm.
