Mr. Ma Zhaoxu (China) (spoke in Chinese): At the
outset, I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General
DiCarlo for her briefing. I welcome the Minister of
the People's Power for Foreign Affairs of Venezuela,
Mr. Jorge Arreaza, to our open meeting today.

China is paying close attention to the current
situation in Venezuela and supports the efforts of
the Venezuelan Government to safeguard State
sovereignty, independence and stability. The affairs
of Venezuela should be up to the Venezuelan people
themselves. China calls on the Venezuelan Government
and opposition to seek a political settlement, within
constitutional and legal frameworks, through dialogue
and consultation.

China notes that, recently, the Venezuelan
Government has remained calm, exercised restraint
and shown dedication to upholding domestic peace
and stability. China maintains that all countries should
abide by the basic principles of international law
and international relations. China opposes foreign
interference in the internal affairs of Venezuela,
military intervention in Venezuela and using the issue
of so-called humanitarian assistance for political
purposes to destabilize or create turbulence within
Venezuela and the neighbouring region. That does not
serve the interests of any party.

China calls on the international community to take
measures that are truly beneficial to the stability and
economic development of Venezuela and that improve
the lives of its people. We hope that the international
community will, on the premise of respecting
Venezuela's sovereignty, provide constructive
assistance to Venezuela in order to facilitate a smooth
resolution of the relevant issues.
