The President: Our next two speakers will be the
Administrator of the United Nations Development
Programme, Mr. Mark Malloch Brown, and the Executive
Director of the Joint United Nations Programme on
HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), Mr. Peter Piot. Their statements will
be of great importance. I urge those joining us here to stay
and absorb the impact of their words.

It is my intention, before they speak, with the
concurrence of Council members, to suspend the meeting
for a few minutes. When the meeting reconvenes, I shall
turn the gavel of the President of the Security Council over
to Ambassador Holbrooke.

I would like to note the presence of three Ministers of
Health who are here with us today from Namibia, Uganda
and Zimbabwe. We have much to learn from these
ministers, and we are all grateful for their attendance.

I would also like to note, before the recess, that in the
United States of America, the work of Senators Jesse
Helms and Joseph Biden - and a strong majority from
both of our major political parties - has expressed fresh
support not only for the United States being a vigorous
member of this body but also for the efforts of this body in
every way, shape and form.

Indeed, it has been a great honour to preside over the
beginning of this meeting. Now, with the concurrence of
Council members, I suspend the meeting.

The meeting was suspended at 11.15 am.
Mr. Holbrooke (United States of America) took the
Chair; the meeting was resumed at 11.30 am.

The President: It is my high personal honour to call
on my friend of over 20 years, the Administrator of the
United Nations Development Programme.
