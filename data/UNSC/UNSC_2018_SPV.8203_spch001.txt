The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2018/218, which contains a letter dated
13 March 2018 from the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the
Permanent Mission of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations
addressed to the President of the Security Council.

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements.
