The President (interpretation from French): The
Security Council will now continue its consideration of the
item on the agenda.

Members of the Council have before them document
S/ 1995/394, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by Botswana, Honduras, Indonesia, Nigeria,
Oman and Rwanda.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless
I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the
vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements before the voting.
