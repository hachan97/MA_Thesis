Ms. Menendez (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): I shall
be very brief, because Greece will shortly make a
statement on behalf of the European Union that, of
course, it will also be making on behalf of the Spanish
delegation. I should like to make only three brief
comments.
We thank Mr. Steiner for his comprehensive
briefing. Resolution 1244 (1999) and the Constitutional
Framework are the cornerstone of the action of the
international community and that of the Security
Council on the question of Kosovo, and thus the
principle of "standards before status" remains valid.

We note from the report of the Secretary-General
(S/2003/113) and from Mr. Steiner's briefing that the
situation in Kosovo has been mixed. For example, there
was improvement on the economic front in 2002, but at
the same time there were structural problems, such as
in job creation and investment, which remain
problematic. In the security field there has been a
general drop in crime, but recently there has also been
an increase in violence with political overtones, which
is disquieting. There has been some progress in the
multi-ethnic area, but not as much as desired. We are
also concerned about the issue of parallel institutions.
Thus we see that there are a number of disquieting
factors.

Our final comment is that we fully support the
priorities indicated by Mr. Steiner for 2003, as well as
the policy of the transfer of authorities, which he hopes
will be carried out by year's end. We hope that such
authorities will be responsibly assumed by those
concerned.
