Mr. Karev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): At the outset, we would like to thank the
President of the Special Court for Sierra Leone and the
Prosecutor and the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs
and International Cooperation of Sierra Leone for their
briefings on activities.

Today's briefings have been of particular importance
in summing up the essence of the work of the Special
Court.

The Special Court is scheduled to close on
30 September 2013, after which date a small residual
mechanism will be launched. International judiciairy
mechanisms already have experience in transitioning to
a mode of residual jurisdiction. As the Council knows,
the Rwandan office of the Residual Mechanism for
International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and the
former Yugoslavia opened in July.

Taking into account the effective work of the
Special Court for Sierra Leone in terms of phasing
out its activities, we hope that it will be able to avoid
the problems that other courts have encountered. We
note the rapid pace with which the Special Court has
conducted its proceedings, including the most recent
case, that is, Charles Taylor's. The report provides
particularly indicative information to the effect that the
Appeals Chamber never exceeded the time allotted to it
for its cases. That is a good example for those courts that
constantly violate the timetables for proceedings while
saying that it is ostensibly impossible to accurately
predict the time needed for their trial activities.

Overall, the outcome of the work of the Special
Court should be evaluated positively. It has made
a considerable contribution to the development of
international criminal justice. In being the first such
hybrid court, including both international and national
elements, and having been established in a post-conflict
phase, it has contributed to strengthening the rule of law
at both the international and the national levels.
