Mr. Takasu (Japan): Japan welcomes the
unanimous adoption of resolution 1870 (2009). We
strongly hope for the continuous, effective
implementation of the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement and urge redoubled support for the
extension of the mandate of the United Nations
Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS), which is playing a
crucial role in assisting in the implementation of the
Agreement.

On this occasion, we express our deep concern at
the expulsion of major non-governmental organizations
by the Sudan, which has seriously affected
humanitarian and reconstruction efforts throughout the
Sudan, including the transitional Three Areas. We are
also concerned at the consequences that the expulsion
will have for the implementation of the Comprehensive
Peace Agreement.

Japan supports the Secretary-General's call for
the Sudanese Government to reconsider its decision.
The cooperation, jointly sponsored and promoted by
the United Nations and the Government of the Sudan,
in addressing the humanitarian gap, including the joint
technical assessment mission, is a very positive step.
However, it is not clear whether the resulting gap can
be adequately filled in that manner. We urge the
Government of the Sudan to provide a secure
environment for smooth humanitarian activities.

As the implementation of the Comprehensive
Peace Agreement enters a very critical phase, it is
essential to accelerate the political process. We urge
both parties to make further efforts to that end, and we
call on the international community to continue to
support such efforts.
