The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank the
representative of Portugal for the kind words he
addressed to me and to the Tunisian delegation as well
as to my colleagues, the members of the Security
Council.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Sweden. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
