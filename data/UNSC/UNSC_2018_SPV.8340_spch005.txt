The President: I want to say that this is the reason
we are having this Security Council meeting, because
the international community needs to pay attention to
the situation in Nicaragua. I thank Mr. Maradiaga for
giving the Nicaraguan people a voice and for taking the
time to be at this meeting. It is important for us to hear
his statement.

I now give the floor to those Council members who
wish to make statements.
