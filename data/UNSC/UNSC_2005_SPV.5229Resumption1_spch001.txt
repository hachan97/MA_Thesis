The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Pakistan, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Akram
(Pakistan) took the seat reserved for him at the
side of the Council Chamber.

The President: I wish to remind all speakers to
limit their statements to no more than five minutes in
order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate their texts in writing and
to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.

As a measure to optimize the use of our time, I
will not individually invite speakers to take seats at the
table or to resume their seats at the side of the
Chamber. When a speaker is taking the floor, the
Conference Officer will seat the next speaker on the
list at the table. I thank representatives for their
understanding and cooperation.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of the Syrian Arab Republic, to whom I
give the floor.
