The President: I thank the representative of
Colombia for his kind words.

I would like to inform members that this is the
last Council meeting that Ambassador Shen of China is
attending with us. I would like to offer him, on behalf
of all the members of the Council and on my own
behalf, our very best wishes for continued success. He
has been the Deputy Permanent Representative of
China, and he will be departing from New York very
shortly. I know that I am speaking on behalf of all
members when I express the hope to be able to see him
again in New York in either an official or unofficial
capacity. We all look forward to that opportunity.
