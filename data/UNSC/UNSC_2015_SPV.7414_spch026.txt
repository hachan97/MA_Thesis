The President (spoke in French): I would like to
remind speakers to kindly limit their statements to
four minutes in order to enable the Council to carry
out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy
statements are kindly requested to circulate the texts
in writing and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking in the Chamber. I would like to appeal to
speakers to deliver their statements at a normal speed
so that interpreters are able to work properly. I wish to
inform all concerned that we will be continuing this
open debate right through the lunch hour, given the
very large number of speakers.

I now give the floor to the representative of Brazil.
