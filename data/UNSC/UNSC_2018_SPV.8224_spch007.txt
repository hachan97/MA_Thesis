Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): Since
last month, China has very closely followed the Skripal
affair in Salisbury. The spokesperson of the Chinese
Foreign Ministry has repeatedly stated our position on
the issue. China has also stated its principled positions
at the Security Council and at the Executive Council
of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons (OPCW). China notes that, at the just-held
fifty-seventh meeting of the OPCW Executive Council
the parties could not reach consensus on a joint
investigation concerning this case. We also note that
the parties concerned have so far failed to reach an
outcome that is acceptable to all.

China firmly opposes the use of chemical weapons
by any country, organization or person in any
circumstance. Any party or actor using chemical
weapons must be brought to justice. China believes
that such issues should be dealt with in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Chemical Weapons
Convention and within the framework of the OPCW.
China believes that it is urgent to discover the truth as
soon as possible, carry out a comprehensive, impartial
and objective investigation and draw conclusions based
on hard evidence that will pass the litmus test of facts
and history. China urges the countries concerned to
carry out consultations, cooperate, avoid politicization
and measures that might further exacerbate tensions
and properly address the issue through dialogue, while
adhering to the principles of equality and mutual respect.

At a time when the international community faces
a plethora of challenges, all parties should abandon
the Cold War mentality and group confrontation,
work together to safeguard world peace, stability and
tranquillity and jointly devote all efforts to building
a new type of international relations based on mutual
respect, equality, justice and win-win cooperation.
