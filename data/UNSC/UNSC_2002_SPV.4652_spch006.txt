Ms. Lee (Singapore): I join my colleagues in
congratulating Colombia on assuming the presidency
of the Council this month and, of course, in expressing
appreciation to the delegation of China for their
presidency last month.

We would also like to thank Mr. James Morris for
his very comprehensive briefing on the food security
situation in Africa and you, Mr. President, for
arranging this briefing today on a very important issue.

I have two main points to make and a few
questions that are related to those points. My first point
is that it is obvious that food insecurity has many
causes and that some factors are beyond our control.
Mr. Morris has explained how adverse climatic
conditions are certainly causes beyond our control. But
he and, I believe, our colleague from the United
Kingdom have also mentioned that sometimes national
Governments have control over their economic,
agricultural and public policies. In relation to that
point, I have one question. Working within the context
of the dual mandate of the World Food Programme
(WFP), that is to say development and dealing with
emergencies, would it be possible for the WFP to
develop programmes in Africa that are self-sustainable
and that would be able to reduce the number of or
eliminate chronic emergencies?

My second point is a general point. Mr. Morris
spoke of the increased demands on the WFP within the
eight months since he has taken over as Executive
Director. But our research has shown that there appears
to be a paradox between the abundant food surpluses
today and the fact that more people are starving today
than ever before. I would first like to ask Mr. Morris
whether he would agree that such a paradox exists and,
if so, if he could comment on the possible causes of
that paradox. Finally I would ask whether Mr. Morris
has any suggestions on how to turn the situation
around.
