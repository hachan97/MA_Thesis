The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of the members
of the Council to the following two documents:
S/2003/766, which contains a letter dated 28 July 2003
from the Secretary-General addressed to the President
of the Security Council, and S/2003/794, which
contains a letter dated 5 August 2003 from the
Permanent Representative of Rwanda to the United
Nations addressed to the President of the Security
Council.

Members of the Council also have before them
document 8/2003/835, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations.

It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to vote on the draft resolution
before it. If I hear no objection, I shall now put the
draft resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Guinea, Mexico, Pakistan,
Russian Federation, Spain, Syrian Arab Republic,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, United States of America
The President (spoke in Arabic): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1503 (2003).

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Council will remain seized of the matter.

The meeting rose at 10.20 am.
