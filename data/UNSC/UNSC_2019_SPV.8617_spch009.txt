Mr. Djani (Indonesia): Like others, I, too, would
like to welcome our new colleague, Ambassador Kelly
Craft, to the Security Council. I would also like to
thank Ambassador Jonathan Cohen for the friendship
and excellent collaboration with our delegation.

Indonesia also welcomes the unanimous
adoption of resolution 2488 (2019). We thank the
penholder and members of the Council for their
constructive engagement.

We have heard the call from the Secretary-General
with regard to progress in the Central African Republic
and the need to ease the current arms embargo on the
country. We have been following the country's progress
since the signing, in Bangui on 6 February, of the
Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in
the Central African Republic. We welcome the efforts
made by the Government to fulfil the benchmarks set

by the Council in such a short time.
The adoption of resolution 2488 (2019) is the
culmination of that progress. It further emphasizes that
sanctions are not the end but the means to achieving
our collective goals. It also shows that sanctions are not
forever and should be used in line with the real situation
on the ground. Indonesia supports the efforts made by
the Government of the Central African Republic and
calls on the wider membership of the United Nations
to continue supporting the Central African Republic.
The Council's unity in adopting resolution 2488 (2019)
should serve as encouragement for the international
community to extend all its support to the Central
African Republic.
