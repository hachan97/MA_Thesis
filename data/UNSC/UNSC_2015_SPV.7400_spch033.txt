Mr. Sergeyev (Ukraine): I would like to make
a general observation. Listening to the Russian
delegation since last year and here again today, I must
repeat what I have been saying since last March. Russia
is an arsonist who is trying to play the role of the fire
safety inspector. As long as it seek to play such a role,
no constructive dialogue will be possible.
