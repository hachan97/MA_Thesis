Mr. Xu Zhongsheng (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
would like to thank Ms. Bensouda for her briefing.

China has been closely following the developments
in Libya and supports its process of political transition
that is being mediated by the United Nations. We
welcome the Libyan political dialogue meeting that will
be used as a forum for Libyan political dialogue, to be
held in Malta, and we hope that it will facilitate the
implementation of the Libyan Political Agreement by
all parties.

We also hope that all parties in Libya will remain
committed to an inclusive, Libyan-led political process,
put their national interests before any other matter,
abide by Security Council resolutions, effectively
implement the Libyan Political Agreement and resolve
their differences through negotiation and consultation,
so as to restore security and stability in the country.
That is the prerequisite and basis for Libya to achieve
judicial justice.

China's position on the international judicial organ
remains unchanged.
