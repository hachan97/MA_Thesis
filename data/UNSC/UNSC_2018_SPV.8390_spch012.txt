Ms. Wronecka (Poland): As this is the first time
this month that I take the floor in the Chamber, allow
me to congratulate you, Mr. President, on assuming the
presidency of the Security Council. I would also like to
thank the Plurinational State of Bolivia for its efforts
and work during its presidency in October. I would like
to thank Ms. Izumi Nakamitsu for her briefing and for
submitting to the Council the latest report (S/2018/971, annex) of the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons (OPCW) on chemical weapons in
Syria. Since the Polish position on chemical weapons
is well-known, I would like to make my remarks brief.

The sixty-first report of the OPCW does not
provide information that would allow us to state that the
declaration submitted by the Syrian Arab Republic can
be considered accurate and complete in accordance with
the Chemical Weapons Convention and the decision
of the OPCW Executive Council. We call on Syria to
cooperate fully with the OPCW in order to clarify all
existing gaps, inconsistencies and discrepancies.

We continuously express our support for the OPCW
Technical Secretariat, the Declaration Assessment
Team and the Fact-finding Mission in their dedication
and professional efforts to maintain and strengthen the
effectiveness and integrity of the Chemical Weapons
Convention. We are concerned by the reports of the
Fact-finding Mission on the use of chemical agents
as weapons in Saraqib, Ltamenah and Douma. Poland
strongly condemns the use of chemical weapons
everywhere, including in Syria. We are of the view that
the perpetrators of those crimes must be brought to
justice. In conclusion, I support all efforts to enhance
the integrity and efficiency of the OPCW. At the same
time, I would also like to echo other speakers and
emphasize the need for the resumption of the political
process in Syria.
