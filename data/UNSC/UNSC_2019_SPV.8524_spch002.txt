Mr. Cohen (United States ofAmerica): The United
States thanks the Council members for their efforts to
ensure that the United Nations Interim Security Force
for Abyei (UNISFA) is appropriately configured for the
current security situation in Abyei, creating space for
the parties to seek a political solution to outstanding
disputes. The Council has shown its commitment to
helping the Sudan, South Sudan and, most important,
the people of Abyei to find lasting peace, security
and stability.

The changes in the mandate are modest but they
are important. Increasing the number of police in
UNISFA while decreasing the number of peacekeepers
helps to address criminality, which is the primary
security concern in Abyei. Police forces trained to
address law enforcement challenges are best equipped
to support the local residents. Adding a civilian
Deputy Head of Mission expands UNISFA's capacity
to manage reconciliation efforts at the local level and
to engage with the parties as they seek to address
outstanding challenges.

The United States encourages the parties to
capitalize on the rapprochement between Khartoum
and Juba and to make more progress in resolving their
disputes related to Abyei. That includes implementing
the Council's adjustments to UNISFA within the
mandated timelines, engaging constructively in the
Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism
and working with the African Union High-level
Implementation Panel to resolve border-related issues.
