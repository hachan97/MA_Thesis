Mr. Reyn (Belgium) (interpretation from French): I
should also like to congratulate you, Sir, on your
reassumption of the presidency of the Security Council.

My delegation would at the outset like to express its
full support for the statement made by delegation of the
United Kingdom on behalf of the European Union.

Belgium welcomes the reactivation of the International
Commission of Inquiry, which is charged with investigating
reports of the sale and supply of arms and related materiel
to the former Rwandan government forces and militias in
the Great Lakes region. There is no doubt that the free flow
of arms jeopardizes the efforts under way to improve the
social, economic and political situation in the region.

Arms trafficking is a destabilizing element in the Great
Lakes region on which the international community can
have an impact. We welcome the Security Council's action.
Indeed, this action also shows the international
community's growing determination to stop uncontrolled
trafficking in small arms.

We hope that the International Commission will be
able to complete its inquiry and to make specific
recommendations to put an end to the illegal flow of arms
into the region.

In the past, the importance my country attaches to the
Commission's work was expressed by a contribution to the
Trust Fund of approximately $100,000. My Government is
now considering a further contribution to the Fund, the
amount of which will be announced at a later time.

Belgium will continue to cooperate fully with the
Commission in order to help in its inquiry.
