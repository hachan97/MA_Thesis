The President: In accordance with the understanding
reached in the Council's prior consultations, I shall take it
that the Security Council decides to extend an invitation
under rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure to
Mrs. Sadako Ogata, United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I welcome Mrs. Ogata and invite her to take a seat at
the Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees. The fact that the briefing is being given in a
public meeting of the Council is a further reflection of the
intention of the Council members to continue to enhance
the transparency of the methods of work of the Council. In
this regard, I would particularly like to acknowledge that
this was a suggestion from our Brazilian colleague,
Ambassador Amorim.

In order to maintain the utility of this session and out
of respect for time constraints, it has been agreed that we
will confine interventions to members of the Council. I
would also ask colleagues to keep in mind that we have
only an hour and a half of Mrs. Ogata's time. I would like
to enable all Council members to ask questions, and
Mrs. Ogata to respond, in that time-frame.

I now give the floor to Mrs. Sadako Ogata, United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to whom the
Council has extended an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure in order to brief the Council.
