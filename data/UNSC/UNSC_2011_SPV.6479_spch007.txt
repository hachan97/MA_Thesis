The President: I thank Ms. Sarah Cliffe for her
briefing.
I wish to remind all speakers to limit their
statements to no more than four minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to circulate the texts in writing and to deliver
a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.

It is now my pleasure to give the floor to the
Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs and Deputy
Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, His
Excellency Mr. Guido Westerwelle.
