The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Mr. Prendergast for his comprehensive briefing on the
situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian
question. Regrettably, his report gives no cause for
optimism for the moment, but we thank him for the
report's comprehensiveness and thoroughness.
In accordance with the understanding reached in
the Council's prior consultations, the Council will now
hold informal consultations to continue its
consideration of the matter.

The meeting rose at 11.05 am.
