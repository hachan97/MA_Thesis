Sir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): I share
the unity of view in both the thanks and praise that have
come out of the statements this morning, and also in the
note of optimism that we have seen a relative success for
the United Nations in Guinea-Bissau.

I just wanted to make two quick points. One is that
we must, on this issue, make sure that we get the post-
conflict situation right. I think this is a chance for us to
go on focusing on what happens after the worst has been
resolved, with the help of the United Nations and the
excellent work done by Mr. Nana-Sinkam and the United
Nations Peace-building Support Office in Guinea-Bissau
(UNOGBIS). That includes, as people have said this
morning, focusing on the police and the armed forces in
particular.

But there is another aspect to it, and that is the
regional aspect. Too often in Africa we have seen
progress at one point washed out by things moving back
in from the region or from outside. The flow of small
arms is one example, but regional politics can also do
damage. We may have to watch that very carefully in
Sierra Leone, for instance. But with the elections in
Senegal, the success in Guinea-Bissau and - I hope -
with an improvement in the fragile situation in Sierra
Leone, West Africa is beginning to show us a bit of an
example of how we can do things in Africa. We must
keep an eye on that post-conflict situation. So I would
want this subject to come back to the Security Council so
that we can keep a check on this part of it and not turn
our backs on it because we think that the work has been
done.
