The President: It is my understanding that the
Security Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the
draft resolution (S/ 1999/201) before it. If I hear no
objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.

 

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Argentina, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, France, Gabon,
Gambia, Malaysia, Namibia, Netherlands, Slovenia,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, United States of America

Against:
China

Abstaining.'
Russian Federation
The President: The result of the voting is as follows:
13 in favour, 1 against and 1 abstention. The draft
resolution has not been adopted, owing to the negative vote
of a permanent member of the Security Council.

I shall now call on those members of the Council who
wish to make statements following the voting.
