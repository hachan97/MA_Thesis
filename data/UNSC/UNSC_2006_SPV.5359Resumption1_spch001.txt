The President: I wish to remind all participants
of the appeals made to them this morning to limit their
statements to no more than five minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.

I give the floor to Her Excellency Mrs. Anne
Leahy, Ambassador of Canada for the Great Lakes
region.
