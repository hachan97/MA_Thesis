Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I do not agree with a number of the observations
made by Ms. Power, but I would simply like to note that
she rightly pointed out that it is important to distinguish
between the moderate opposition and Jabhat Al-Nusra,
which is exactly what we are saying. As for the rest,
I am not going to engage in dispute, as I would like
to end on a positive note and I want to hear from our
colleague the Rermanent Representative of Syria.
