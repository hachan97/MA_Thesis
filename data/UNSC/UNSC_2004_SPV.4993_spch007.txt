The President: I thank the Secretary-General of
Care for his expression of support for our theme. I also
welcome the tribute he paid to trailblazers in civil
society and peace-building, especially to women's
groups and child rights advocates. I also note with
interest his specific recommendations.

I now call on Mr. Ian Martin, Vice President of
the International Center for Transitional Justice.
