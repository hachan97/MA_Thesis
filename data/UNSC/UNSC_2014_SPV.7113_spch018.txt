The President: I wish to remind all speakers to
limit their statements to no more than four minutes
in order that the Council may carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements
are kindly requested to circulate their texts in writing
and to deliver a condensed version. I wish to inform
participants that we will be continuing this open debate
right through the lunch hour, as we have a very large
number of speakers.

After saying that, which is not directly addressed
specifically to my friend Edgars Rinkevics, I am very
happy to give the floor to the Minister for Foreign
Affairs of Latvia.
