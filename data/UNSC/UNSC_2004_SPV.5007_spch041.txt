The President: It is a great pleasure to welcome
Mr. Passy and his contribution to our debate. Indeed,
the OSCE has tremendous competence. Its field
missions are uniquely equipped to give the early-
warning messages that he has been speaking about, and
I also welcome the contribution of the OSCE in
addressing regional conflicts in the Caucasus and in the
Eurasian space.

I wish also once again to join our voice to those
that have condemned the atrocious killing of a
Bulgarian citizen. I think that the idea of a code of
conduct in such situations is a valuable idea that we
should support politically.

There are a number of speakers remaining on my
list for this meeting. For very practical biological
reasons, I intend, with the concurrence of the members
of the Council, to suspend the meeting until 3 p.m.

The meeting was suspended at 1.25 p.m.
