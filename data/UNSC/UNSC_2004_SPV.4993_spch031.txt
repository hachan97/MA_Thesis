The President: I thank the representative of
Brazil for his kind and warm words of welcome and for
citing the significant role of civil society as an
effective partner in the reconstruction and post-conflict
peace-building efforts of the Council. I should like to
take this opportunity to convey, through you, our
appreciation to President Cardoso for his important
work and contribution.
