The President: I should like to ask the
representative of Mali to thank President Konare for his
important message to the Security Council, which we
welcome.

The next speaker on my list, and the last member of
the Security Council to take the floor today, is the
representative of Jamaica. We are delighted that Jamaica,
which is welcomed here by its many friends in the United
Nations, has joined the Security Council.
