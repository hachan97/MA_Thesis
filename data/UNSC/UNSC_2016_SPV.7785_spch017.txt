Mr. Pressman (United States of America): This
text was a deceptive attempt to get the Security Council
to ratify what Russia and the regime are doing in
Aleppo, as they will undoubtedly claim that any and all
of the devastation that they are raining down is directed
at terrorists, not the innocent civilians and civilian
infrastructure that they are very clearly striking. But I
will not belabour this point. What Russia wants is for
there to be more talk while they seek to take the city by
brutal force. What we want is less talk and more action
for them to stop the slaughter.
