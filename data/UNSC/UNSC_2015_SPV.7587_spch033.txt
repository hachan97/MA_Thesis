The President: I thank the Permanent Representative
of the Russian Federation for his statement and offer
condolences for the lives lost in the terrorist attack on a
civilian flight carrying so many holiday travelers.

There are no more names inscribed on the list of
speakers. Before adjourning the meeting, I would like
to make a few closing remarks.

This has been an unprecedented meeting, as well
as a constructive and productive one. We have adopted
resolution 2253 (2015), which will help us protect
the international financial system from abuse and
exploitation by terrorists, and we have reviewed our
work to counter the financing of the Islamic State in
Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). We have also reaffirmed our
commitment to using the measures contained in today's
resolution and the tools that we have honed over the
past 14 years to make the world safer from ISIL and
other deadly terrorist groups. We must remain united
as we move forward to execute our task with the same
determination with which we have spoken today in the
adoption of the resolution. That is the only way we will
be effective in combating the threat of terrorism.

I thank the Secretary-General and I thank
Ambassador Power for organizing the meeting.

The meeting rose at 5.25 pm.
