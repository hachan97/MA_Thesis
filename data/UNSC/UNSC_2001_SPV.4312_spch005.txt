The President: I thank the High Commissioner
for her important and very relevant statement to us.

I am now going to give the floor to members of
the Council who wish to speak. Could I remind
members and non-members of the Council that I have
asked for interventions to aim at five minutes as a limit
on speaking so that everybody can have the time to
speak during the course of the day. Any Member State
can make arrangements with the Secretariat for paper
copies of their remarks to be recorded in full if in
speaking they wish to curtail them or draw attention
orally to specific parts of them, in the interests of time.
They can make that arrangement with the Secretariat to
get their written speech into the record if they wish to
shorten it in their oral remarks.

Could I also say to members that if questions are
raised during the course of the debate, either to the
Secretariat, the High Commissioner or each other, I
will make arrangements for those questions to be taken
up within a fairly short period of their being raised, so
that we can get some interaction on points that are
raised during the debate.
