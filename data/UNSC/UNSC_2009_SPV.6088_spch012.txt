Mr. Rugunda (Uganda): Ijoin my colleagues in
welcoming the statement made by the Foreign Minister
of Greece. I am happy that the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has been
working closely with the United Nations system and
would like to see that regional organization also
working more closely with organizations such as the
African Union, because regional organizations should
share experiences.

I would like to join my colleague, the
representative of Libya, in stating that the Security
Council, in particular, should not have double
standards. It is true that the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,
Uganda and Burkina Faso made vigorous attempts to
have the delegations of the League of Arab States and
African Union meet with the Security Council to
express their views and raise issues of concern to the
Arab League and to Africa. To our surprise, there was
resistance in the Council. Definitely, the Council
should be ready to listen to different regional
organizations when there are matters that concern those
regions. Otherwise, the Council's standing will begin
to be doubted when we easily give access to a regional
organization in Europe but when regional organizations
such as the League of Arab States and the African
Union cannot easily gain access to the Council to
express their views on issues of concern.

It does not matter whether Council members
agree or not. What is important is that there should be
free communication between different regional
organizations and the Security Council, especially on
human rights or security issues. I believe that the
Council will become stronger and more respected if
that channel of communication remains open.

Nevertheless, I welcome the Greek Foreign
Minister, and I think that this was a good opportunity
for the Council to listen to her and gain from the
experiences of the organization that she leads and learn
from its work, not only with the Council but also other
regional organizations in Africa and beyond.
