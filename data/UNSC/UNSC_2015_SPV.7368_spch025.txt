Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I am a little surprised at our Ukrainian
colleague has begun to argue using concepts that I did
not voice during my comments in the Council today.
But it is good that he he has remembered them and that
he deems it necessary to continue to argue about things
that are simply not subject to argument, concerning
Stepan Bandera and other related matters.

I am, however, puzzled by something else. I am
gratified by the fact that our Ukrainian colleague has
assimilated the English language and that he speaks it
so well, but I am just stunned by the fact that he has
forgotten his Russian, because only a few moments ago
I explained the thrust of the problem facing the east.
Instead of simply accepting that and building a political
position based on it, we hear the same old propaganda. Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
That is quite regrettable. of its consideration ofthe item on its agenda.
