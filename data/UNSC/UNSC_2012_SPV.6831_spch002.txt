Mr. Touray (Sierra Leone): Once again, the
Council has demonstrated its collective determination
to see Sierra Leone succeed. I want to assure Council
members that there is ongoing political will on the part
of the Government, as well as a common will and interest
on the part of ordinary folk, for the country to succeed.
In my view, the threat may lie in the interplay of party
politics, and we urge that no effort be spared to resolve
that issue in the interest of the peace consolidation
process in Sierra Leone. We hope that this will ensure
that the process will gravitate in the direction ofmoving
the country towards its development goals.

I thank the members of the Council for the
unanimity they have shown in adopting resolution 2065
(2012).
