The President (spoke in French): In accordance
with the decision taken by the Council at its 57llth
meeting, I invite the representatives of Burkina Faso
and Cote d'lvoire to participate in this meeting, in
accordance with rule 37 of the Council's provisional
rules of procedure.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

After consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council strongly condemns
the attack committed on 29 June 2007 in Bouake
against the Prime Minister of Cote d'Ivoire,
Mr. Guillaume Soro, that resulted in several
deaths, and any attempt to destabilize the peace
process by force. It stresses that the perpetrators
of this criminal act must be brought to justice.

"The Security Council recalls its support for
the political agreement signed by President
Laurent Gbagbo and Mr. Guillaume Soro in
Ouagadougou on 4 March 2007 under the
facilitation of the Chairperson of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS),
President Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso. It
stresses that it is critical that all parties continue
to work within the framework of the
Ouagadougou political agreement, which is the
way to settle the crisis in Cote d'lvoire."

This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2007/25.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on the
agenda.
