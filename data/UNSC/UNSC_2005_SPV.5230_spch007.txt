The President: I thank the representative of
Israel for his kind words addressed to me.

We have a long list of speakers. I am fully aware
of the importance of the discussion that we are having
today and fully aware of past practices. Nevertheless, I
wish to kindly request all speakers to limit their
statements, to the extent possible, to no more than five
minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its
work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy
statements are kindly requested to circulate their texts
in writing and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking in the Chamber.
