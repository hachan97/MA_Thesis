Mr. Sergeyev (Ukraine): When we found out that
it was Russia that took the initiative to convene today's
Security Council meeting, we asked ourselves why.
Having heard the same old rhetoric from the Russian
side today, which denies any involvement in the crime
and blames everyone but itself, I cannot help but
remember the old saying that a guilty mind is never at
ease.
