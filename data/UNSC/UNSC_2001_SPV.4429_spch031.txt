The President: The debate that we have had this
morning clearly indicates the importance which
members of the Council attach to the work and
operations of the Tribunals - the International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the International
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. On behalf
of the members of the Council, I wish to thank the
Presidents and Chief Prosecutors of the Tribunals for
their contribution to the work and deliberation of the
Council on this very important subject.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
ofits consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 1.20 p.m.
