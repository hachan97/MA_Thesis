The President (spoke in Chinese): In accordance
with arrangements made among members of the
Council, I shall adjourn the meeting shortly and resume
it this afternoon. Following statements made by the
speakers remaining on my list, Ambassador Morjane
will respond to questions raised by members of the
Council and we will adopt the presidential statement.

The next speaker on my list is the representative
of Rwanda. I invite him to take a seat at the Council
table and to make his statement.
