I listened carefully to the briefing given by Prosecutor Bensouda, and I welcome Ambassador Siddig, Permanent Representative of the Sudan, to this meeting. The Sudan's peace process and political transition have made important progress. China welcomes the formal signing of the Juba Peace Agreement between the Sudanese transitional Government and the relevant parties, which is a crucial step in the Sudan's transition process and an important opportunity for the country to achieve comprehensive and lasting peace. China encourages the signatories to earnestly fulfil their commitments and promote the full implementation of the Agreement and calls on the parties that have not signed it to join the peace process as soon as possible. We hope that all parties will work together to realize the transition from peacekeeping to peacebuilding in the Sudan. China notes that the Prosecutor and other officials of the International Criminal Court have been unilaterally sanctioned. Many countries, including many members of the Security Council today, have condemned that. China has always opposed unilateral sanctions that are inconsistent with international law. At the same time, it hopes that the International Criminal Court will strictly follow the principle of complementary jurisdiction in its work, truly respect national judicial sovereignty and avoid interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Regarding issues involving the Sudan, the legitimate and reasonable demands of the Sudanese Government and the African Union should be taken seriously, and the sovereignty of the Sudan and the opinions of the Sudanese Government should be fully respected.
