Mr. Al-Hussein (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): At
the outset, I wish to congratulate you, Mr. President, on
your assumption of the presidency of the Security
Council this month. We wish you every success in
leading the deliberations of the Council. We also
express our appreciation to His Excellency
Ambassador Emyr Jones Parry for his impressive
presidency of the Council last month. I also wish to
thank you, Sir, for convening this emergency meeting.

The convening of this important meeting at this
time to examine the situation in the Middle East is a
clear manifestation of the Security Council's
recognition of the grave developments that have taken
place in the our region that will endanger the peace
process and will lead to bloodshed.

The Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of
Jordan strongly condemns the aerial attack by Israel
this morning against the Syrian Arab Republic.

International law in this regard is very clear. No
party can act outside of the jurisdiction of Article 2,
paragraph 4 of the Charter, which prohibits the use of
force except in two cases. The first case is if the use of
force is used under Article 51 of the Charter, which
reflects the principle of self-defence. However, the
exercise of that right on the part of any State is
conditioned on a prior armed attack against it. The
second case is if the Security Council authorizes the
use of force under Chapter VII of the Charter.

Neither case applies in this matter. The
Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan calls
upon Israel to cease forthwith using force and any
forms of violence, comply with international law and
respect the sovereignty of all States of the region.
