Mr. Zhang Jun (China) (spoke in Chinese): | am very pleased to be able to speak in Chinese today. While we voted in favour of resolution 2536 (2020), China also believes that overall the political and security in Central African Republic is improving. All parties in the Central African Republic continue to be committed to implementing the Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in the Central African Republic and are actively making progress in implementing the benchmarks for the arms embargo assessment. China commends those efforts. China would like to stress that it supports the Government of the Central African Republic in continuing to meet those benchmarks. We support the Council in continuing to respond positively to the reasonable needs of the Government of the Central African Republic so as to lift the arms embargo against the Central African Republic as soon as possible. That will help the Government of the Central African Republic to strengthen its capacity to maintain national safety and security and facilitate the political settlement of the Central African Republic issue.
