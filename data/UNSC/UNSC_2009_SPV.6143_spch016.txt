Mr. Tiendrebeogo (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French): The delegation of Burkina Faso voted in
favour of the draft resolution submitted to us because
we wanted, at this stage, for the United Nations to be
able to maintain a presence in the region without the
mission finding itself in legal limbo. The parties would
then have had an opportunity to pursue negotiations on
questions of substance. We regret that the Council was
unable to approve this technical renewal of the
mandate for a few extra weeks.
In spite of it all, my delegation would like to
believe in the will of all parties to overcome their
current differences, however deep-seated they may be,
in order to allow the United Nations to maintain a
presence in the region on the basis of the report of the
Secretary-General.

In conclusion, we call on all parties to exercise
restraint in order to give priority to the peaceful
settlement of differences in the region.
