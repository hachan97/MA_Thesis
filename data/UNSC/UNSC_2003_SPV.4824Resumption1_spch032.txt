The President: It is not that we do not have time
to hear. It is the fact that on Friday the presidency
deliberately proposed that there should be an open
debate, and that is what we are trying to provide. But
so that the membership can have an opportunity, so that
all can reflect those views and so that the Council can
then do justice to the proper request for consultations
on the subject, it is necessary to impose a guillotine.

I work on the assumption that in two minutes one
ought to be able to get across three bull points. So three
minutes is a bonus. It is a bit of a challenge. It is not
what we are accustomed to, but I defy anybody not to
be able to make the main salient points in three
minutes. I am trying to do justice to one and all, and
without favour, as you see. It was the European Union
that was cut off as the first speaker.

The next speaker is the representative of
Argentina. I invite him to take a seat at the Council
table and to make his statement.
