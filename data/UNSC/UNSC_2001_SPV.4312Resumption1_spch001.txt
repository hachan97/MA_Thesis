Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Indonesia, Israel and Nepal, in which
they request to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the discussion, without the right to

Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Thayeb

(Nepal) took the seats reserved for them at the
Side ofthe Council Chamber.

The President: I propose, in the absence of
objection, to extend an invitation under rule 39 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Kenzo
Oshima, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian
Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Oshima to take a seat at the Council
table.

I give the floor to Mr. Oshima to respond to
comments made and questions raised in the debate so
far.
