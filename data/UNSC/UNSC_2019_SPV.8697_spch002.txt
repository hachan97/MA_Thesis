Mr. Heusgen (Germany): I would like to briefly
introduce draft resolution S/ZOl9/96l on behalf of the
co-penholders, Belgium, Germany and Kuwait.

In formulating and proposing this draft resolution,
we were motivated by the dire humanitarian situation
in Syria. This morning we once again heard about the
human suffering in the country (see S/PV.8696) through
the personal testimony of a victim of the violence
there. There are still more than 11 million people in
Syria who are in need of humanitarian aid, of whom at
least 4 million depend on the cross-border mechanism
that the Council decided on some time ago in adopting
resolution 2165 (2014). It was the bleak humanitarian
situation that led us to propose the renewal of the cross-
border mechanism.

In our discussions and our work on the text, we
consulted with everybody and went through many
iterations. We heard various requests, such as including
five rather than four crossing points, or only two
crossing points. The proposal before the Council is
based on responding to the humanitarian needs of the
Syrian people. Our understanding is that there are two
crossing points that are absolutely essential. There
is also a third, to Iraq, which both the Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the World
Health Organization say they need to get medical
equipment into Syria. With regard to the fourth crossing
point, which has not been used in the last 18 months, we
decided to revisit the possibility of reopening it in six
months ifthere is a need. We were also willing to reduce
the renewal term from 12 to six months, after which, if
the Council considered that the situation had improved
enough to terminate the mechanism, we would follow
its recommendation.

I urge our colleagues to vote in favour of this draft
resolution, for the people suffering in Syria, and for the
4 million people who depend on the Council to vote in
favour of the text so that their needs can continue to
be met.
