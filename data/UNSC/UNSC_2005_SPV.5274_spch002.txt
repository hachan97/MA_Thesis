Mr. Jenie (Indonesia): Let me express the full
appreciation of the Government and the people of
Indonesia for the recognition and prompt attention that
has been paid by the Security Council to the tragic
bombings in Bali last Saturday. We are mindful of this
concern for the tragic and senseless attacks on ordinary
people leading ordinary lives.

Let me also take this opportunity to express the
condolences of the Government of Indonesia to those
families and nations that lost people in the brutal
attacks of the weekend.
In condemning the latest Bali attacks, President
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono stressed that they were
"clearly acts of terrorism because the victims were
indiscriminately chosen and the targets were public
areas". All of Indonesia is understandably horrified by
this brutal tragedy, which is being speedily
investigated. The perpetrators will be made to account
for their actions.

Let me make one point very clear. The
Government of Indonesia will not be derailed in its
efforts to create an open, democratic society. We will
not be blackmailed or scared away from our efforts to
enhance development. We will not succumb to
terrorism or to any other kind of organized crime. We
will continue to cooperate with other nations which are
working hard to develop a comprehensive response to
terrorism. We know that, in the end, terrorism will be
defeated.

As for Bali, we know that its status as a front-line
tourist destination will not change or be destroyed by
terrorists hoping to scare visitors away. Bali will
recover, it will continue to grow, and it will continue to
receive visitors from all over the world. We will work
hard on this front.

Finally, let me restate the belief of the
Government of Indonesia that our approach to
combating terrorism should include efforts to win the
hearts and minds of the people. We must enhance
efforts to promote tolerance and peaceful coexistence
by empowering the moderates of our society.
