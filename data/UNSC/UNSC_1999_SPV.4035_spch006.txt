Mr. Granovsky (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I associate myself with the kind words addressed
to you and to your country by the representatives of Sierra
Leone and the United Kingdom. I cannot say it any better
than Ambassador Eldon did.

The Security Council is preparing to adopt an
extremely important draft resolution on Sierra Leone. Its
significance goes beyond the expansion of the staff of the
United Nations Observer Mission in that country; it consists
primarily in the fact that the Security Council is making a
significant contribution to the consolidation of the important
progress that has been made in finding a political settlement
in Sierra Leone.

We are pleased to note that there are positive
developments inside and outside that African country. At
the same time, we see how fragile the peace in Sierra
Leone remains, and we therefore deem it absolutely
essential that the interested parties do everything they can
to consolidate the gains already made. This applies
primarily to the representatives of the belligerent forces in
Sierra Leone, who must scrupulously abide by the Peace
Agreement. A great deal will also depend on neighbouring
countries and regional organizations and on the atmosphere
in which peace-building in Sierra Leone takes place.

As always, a special role will be played by the
international community. We believe that the Secretary-
General's proposal to develop a strategic framework
approach for Sierra Leone is extremely timely. We are
prepared to play a constructive role in this effort.

In conclusion, I would like to express the hope that
our common efforts will make it possible to establish a
long-awaited lasting peace in the long-suffering country
of Sierra Leone.
