Mr. Pavlichenko (Ukraine): Let me start by
congratulating you, Mr. President, on your assumption
of the presidency of the Security Council for the month
of May. We wish you every success in fulfilling that
duty. We also want to thank the Nigerian delegation
for its successful presidency last month. I would also
like to extend our thanks to the Security Council
delegations for their support of, and solidarity with, the
Government and the people of Ukraine. I also thank
Mr. Feltman for his briefing today.

Ukraine remains committed to the implementation
of the agreements reached at the meeting of the Foreign
Ministers of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the
European Union and the United States in Geneva on
17 April. Free and fair presidential elections on 25 May
remain a top priority of the Government of Ukraine.

We reject all attempts by Russia to blame the
Government of Ukraine for allegedly failing to
implement the agreements. We wouldl ike to say
that, despite numerous calls by the international
community, the Russian Federation has made no
efforts to de-escalate the situation and implement the
Geneva agreement. Instead, Russia strongly supports
illegal militant groups operating in the eastern region
of Ukraine, endangering civilians, seizing hostages and
creating an atmosphere of terror and violence.

Security, as well as the protection of the rights
and fundamental freedoms of all the people of
Ukraine, remains a top priority for the Government
of Ukraine. Therefore, the purpose of the counter-
terrorist operation, the active phase of which has been
renewed in Sloviansk, is to isolate illegal militants from
the civilian population of the city. The commander
of the counter-terrorist operation has ordered the
heavily armed illegal militants to immediately free all
hostages, including monitors of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, to evacuate all
seized administrative buildings and to stop the violence
and massacres. The Ukrainian authorities are ready to
provide amnesty to all those members of militant groups
who have not committed serious crimes. Inclusive
political dialogue with peaceful protesters remains a
top priority for the Ukrainian Government.

We officially state that no tanks or missiles are
used against civilians. Russian statements about the
participation of non-governmental armed groups in
the counter-terrorist operation are not true. Russian
statements as to the involvement of English-speaking
foreigners are absolutely cynical and false. We officially
state that the only foreign military personnel in eastern
Ukraine are Russian saboteurs and mercenaries.

The Ukrainian side, as well as the Russian Embassy
in Kyiv, was not duly informed about today's arrival in
Ukraine ofVladimir Lukin, the so-called representative
of the Russian President whose mission is, as he says,
to contribute to the liberation of the hostages taken
in eastern Ukraine. Despite the circumstances of
Mr. Lukin's arrival, and taking into account the highest
priority that the Ukrainian Government attaches to
the release of all hostages held by illegal militants,
we are ready to discuss with Mr. Lukin, as with other
interested mediators, his practical contribution in order
to resolve the problem.

I would like to remind the Council that, due to
the particularly dangerous situation in Sloviansk, in
accordance with our 2003 law on combating terrorism,
Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council has
taken the decision to launch a large-scale counter-
terrorism operation. Owing to increasing threats to
the civilian population, this morning the active phase
of that counter-terrorism operation was renewed in the
area of the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, where
units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the National
Guard and the Ukrainian Border Service were engaged.
The counter-terrorist operation is being implemented
exclusively by the law-enforcement agencies of Ukraine.

At the moment, nine terrorist checkpoints have been
taken under the control of Ukrainian law-enforcement
agencies in Sloviansk. The illegal militants, many
of whom are foreign mercenaries, are using heavy
firearms against the Ukrainian special forces. They
have shot down two Ukrainian helicopters with rocket-
propelled grenades, man-portable air defence system
guided missiles and anti-aircraft guns. Two officers
have been killed and seven wounded. The terrorists
do not hesitate to use members of the local peaceful
population as human shields. The brutal tactic of firing
from residential buildings is used widely in Sloviansk
by the terrorists, who are very well aware of the
Government instructions to its law-enforcement agents
not to answer fire coming from residential buildings.

I would also like to mention that this evening there
were also attempts to break through the State border by
groups of armed Russian saboteurs, who were stopped
by our guards. That is why we call on our Russian
partners to immediately stop supporting all the illegal
militants on Ukraine's territory and other actions aimed
at undermining the sovereignty and territorial integrity
of my country.

In conclusion, I would like to cite the statement
made today by Mr. Oleksandr Turchynov, Acting
President of Ukraine. He said that Ukraine demands
that terrorist saboteurs and all those who have taken
up arms in our country lay down their weapons and
surrender their hostages and occupied administrative
buildings. Those who lay down their arms and are not
involved in serious crimes will be given amnesty, but
those accused of murder and torture will be punished.
Ukraine, he said, would secure peace and stability in
spite of all the efforts to organize acts provocation and
unrest aimed at destabilizing the situation in the east
and and south of the country, particularly in Kharkiv
and Odessa. He said that he would also like to appeal
to the leadership of the Russian Federation to end the
hysteria about the events taking place in Ukraine and
to cease its threats and intimidation. If it is concerned
about violations of citizens' rights, it should protect
them in its own country, where human rights are
systematically violated. He also called on Russia to end
its acts of provocation against Ukraine and to refrain
from using terrorism, sabotage and military threats as
a form of pressure on it. Despite all the problems and
opposition, he said, peace would be ensured in Ukraine
and the terrorist threat in eastern Ukraine would be
stopped.
