The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the
representative of Israel for his kind words addressed to
the members of the Council.

I would like to inform Council members that,
because of some confusion in the paperwork, I did not
give the floor to the Syrian Arab Republic earlier. I
would like to do so now.
