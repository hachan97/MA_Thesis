The President (interpretation from French): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Mauritania in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the discussion without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Ould Ely
(Mauritania) took the place reserved for him at the
side of the Council Chamber.

The President (interpretation from French): The next
speaker is the representative of Sudan. I invite him to take
a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
