Mr. Rosselli (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): I will
be very brief. I have made the impromptu decision to
speak, having been encouraged by the words of praise
my delegation has received from some ofmy colleagues
herewith regard to ourwork in the Committee established
pursuant to resolution 1572 (2004), concerning Cote
d'Ivoire. To be quite frank, my delegation played a very
limited role. In reality, we merely reaped the benefit of
the work done by the person who preceded me in the
chairmanship of the Committee, Ambassador Cristian
Barros Melet of Chile, who is present in the Chamber
today. He and the Chilean delegation are far more
deserving of congratulations than am I.
