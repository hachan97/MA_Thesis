Mr. Essonghe (Gabon) (interpretation from French):
In my turn, I would like to express my delegation's regret
over the turn that events have taken since this morning,
despite the numerous diplomatic efforts that have been
made at all levels.

The lengthy crisis that has prevailed between a
Member of the United Nations and the Security Council
could have been avoided in the light of the initiatives
undertaken in February and November this year by the
Secretary-General, who is present here, and by the entire
membership of the Security Council. Those efforts gave
us a glimpse of a possible peaceful resolution of the
misunderstandings and lack of understanding on both
sides.

Unfortunately, we must conclude that the new state
of mind and the hope that emerged on numerous
occasions have now been dashed by the events we have
learned about today. Nevertheless, we would like to
congratulate the Secretary-General on his readiness to
contribute to a new effort to produce a peaceful resolution
of the question.
