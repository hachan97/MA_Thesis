Mrs. Gueguen (France) (spoke in French): France
also welcome's the unanimous adoption of resolution
2495 (2019). We are pleased that we were able to unite
and respond positively to the requests formulated by the
Sudanese Prime Minister.
This resolution also lays the strongest possible
foundations for the peace process to succeed. Renewing
the mandate of the African Union-United Nations
Hybrid Operation in Darfur for 12 months, including
five months in its current configuration, means that the
mission can support the peace process and we avoid
creating a security vacuum while the peace negotiations
are under way. France calls on all armed groups to
participate in good faith in those talks, to which we
stand ready to contribute. This historic opportunity to
build lasting peace in the Sudan must not be missed.

We will have to continue supporting peace in Darfur
after the Blue Helmets leave, as in other countries. We
hope that the tripartite structure comprising the Sudan,
the United Nations and the African Union will be able
to make recommendations in December on a follow-
up mechanism, so that the Security Council can take a
decision in that regard by 31 March.

Finally, we thank Germany and the United Kingdom
as co-penholders for their tireless and effective efforts.
