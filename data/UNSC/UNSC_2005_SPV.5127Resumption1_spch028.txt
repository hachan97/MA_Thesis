Mr. Abe: Ijust have a few words to say. I would
like once again to express my thanks for the
opportunity provided today by this open debate on the
question of small arms. I also wish to thank the
delegations that expressed words of encouragement to
the Secretariat for the continuation and intensification
of our work. Those of us in the Secretariat - its
departments and branches - will be intensifying our
work with renewed vigour. We shall also be
strengthening our coordination within the Secretariat
and with the related agencies.
