The President: I would like to thank Mr. James
Morris, Executive Director of the World Food
Programme, for those remarks and for the splendid
work that the World Food Programme is doing in Iraq
and elsewhere.

I now give the floor to Mr. Mark Malloch Brown,
Administrator of the United Nations Development
Programme.
