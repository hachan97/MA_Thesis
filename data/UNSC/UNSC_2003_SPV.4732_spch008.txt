Mr. Tafrov (Bulgaria) (spoke in French):
Bulgaria welcomes the fact that the Council has
unanimously adopted this resolution, which deals with
an especially urgent matter of major importance. First,
we are grateful to Ambassador Pleuger and the German
delegation for the excellent work they have done in
recent days. I will repeat what I said yesterday. For
Bulgaria, the adoption of this resolution would not
have been possible without the political as well as
moral prestige of the Secretary-General, who has
brought all of his weight to bear behind these
proposals. His influence and prestige have enabled us
to regain our unity today. Bulgaria welcomes this as do
other delegations.
