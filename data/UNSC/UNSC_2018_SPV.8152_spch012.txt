Ms. Wronecka (Poland): At the outset, I would like
to congratulate you, Mr. President, for assuming the
presidency. Poland is ready to support you, but we are
also very privileged to join the Security Council with
new elected members and ready for close cooperation.
I would like to thank Assistant Secretary-General
Mr. Taye-Brook Zerihoun for a very useful presentation.

Poland has been following recent developments
in Iran with great attention. We are deeply concerned
about the tragic loss of human lives. All sides should
unconditionally avoid violence and exercise maximum
restraint. We also wish to emphasize that basic human
rights and fundamental freedoms, such as the right
to peaceful assembly and demonstrations and the
freedom of opinion and expression, must be protected
and respected in line with international human rights
instruments, including the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights, which the Islamic Republic
of Iran is a party to.

Iran has a dynamic society with a young vibrant
component that wants to be heard. Based on our historic
experience, Poland encourages all sides - and only
Iranians can do this - to engage in a peaceful dialogue
as that is the best way to address the challenges faced
by the Iranian society.

Poland would also like to take this opportunity
to express its concerns about the growing tensions in
the region. Iran has the potential to play a constructive
role and contribute to regional stability and security.
Therefore, we invite the Iranian authorities and the other
countries in the region to work towards a de-escalation
of tensions and avoid actions that may contribute to
violence, sectarianism or polarization.
