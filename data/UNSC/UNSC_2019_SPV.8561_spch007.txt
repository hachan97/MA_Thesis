The President (spoke in Arabic): If there are no
objections to any of the briefers for this meeting, we
shall proceed.

It was so decided.

Mr. Lowcock and Major General Bakin are joining
the meeting via video-teleconference from Rome and
Damascus, respectively.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members to
document S/2019/508, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the implementation of Security
Council resolutions 2139 (2014), 2165 (2014), 2191
(2014), 2258 (2015), 2332 (2016), 2393 (2017), 2401
(2018) and 2449 (2018).

I now give the floor to Mr. Lowcock.
