Mr. Allen (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom continues to support a sovereign, stable
Lebanon, governed and underpinned by legitimate
State institutions. We recognize that the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon makes a significant
contribution to Lebanon's stability and security and we
are pleased to renew its mandate for a further year. We
reiterate the need for all parties to allow the mission to
deliver its mandate in full. That is particularly pertinent
at the present time.

The United Kingdom is deeply concerned about
the recent escalation between Israel and Hizbullah,
and we condemn all violations resolution 1701 (2006).
We strongly urge all parties to show restraint and to
de-escalate. Conflict is in no one's interest.
