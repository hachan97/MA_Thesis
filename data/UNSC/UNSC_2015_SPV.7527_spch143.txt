Mr. Awad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): I did not intend to take the floor again at this
late hour, but the representative of the Saudi regime
always insists on receiving a response to his claims at
every occasion and at every meeting. Indeed, on every
occasion that representative continues to introduce the
subject of my country. This morning and this afternoon,
we have heard that the main threat posed to the world
and the Middle East is my country, as well as the Daesh
and other terrorist groups, such as Jabhat Al-Nusra.

The representative of the Saudi regime said that we
have deviated from the right path and that the positive
effort initiated by the Russian Federation in holding
this meeting deviates from the need to counter the real
threat, which is Daesh. The Saudi regime plays a role
in arming and financing terrorist groups. That has been
clear to all - from Daesh to Jabhat al-Nusra and Jaish
Al-Islam. We know the role it plays with regard to those
terrorist groups. Without the role of foreign forces,
including the Saudi regime, terrorism would not have
spread. We would have eliminated it long ago.

I will not add anything. Ijust wanted to refute those
false allegations.
