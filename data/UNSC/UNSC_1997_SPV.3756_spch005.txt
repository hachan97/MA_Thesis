Mr. Wang Xuexian (China) (interpretation from Chinese): In spite of the repeated calls made by the
international community that Israel stop its settlement
activities in East Jerusalem, the Israeli Government still
persists in carrying out its plan. We would like to express
our deep concern over the development of the situation.
We feel that this will certainly create obstacles for the
ongoing Palestinian-Israeli talks. We are also deeply
concerned over the development of the peace process. We
call again on the Israeli Government to stop immediately
its settlement activities in East Jerusalem.

I would like to emphasize the principled position of
the Chinese Government that the question of Jerusalem

 

should be settled by all sides concerned through peaceful
negotiations and on the basis of the relevant resolutions of
the United Nations. We sincerely hope that all sides
concerned will exercise caution and refrain from taking any
actions that are unfavourable to the peace process in the
Middle East.

We feel that under the present circumstances it is
necessary that the Security Council send the Israeli
Government a clear and unequivocal message calling upon
it to cease immediately the settlement activities. The
Chinese delegation will therefore vote in favour of the draft
resolution before us.
China condemns all forms of terrorist activities. We
deeply regret the bombing incident that took place in Tel
Aviv today. We would like to take this opportunity to
express our condolences to the families of the victims.
