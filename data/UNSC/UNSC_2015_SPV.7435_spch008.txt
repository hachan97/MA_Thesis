Mr. Gaspar Martins (Angola): The Security
Council has just adopted resolution 2218 (2015), which
extends the mandate of the United Nations Mission for
the Referendum in Western Sahara. I am speaking in
explanation of vote in my capacity as coordinator of
the African State Members of the Security Council,
that is, Angola, Chad and Nigeria, and taking into
account our adopted position, recommended to us by
the African Union Peace and Security Council, with a
View to playing a more active and constructive role in
the search for solutions to the issue of Western Sahara.

The three African Member States of the Security
Council voted in favour of today's resolution in the
conviction that first, the Security Council is really
committed to the self-determination of the people of
Western Sahara; secondly, that it is committed to ending
the current impasse in efforts to achieve progress
towards a political solution; thirdly, that it recognizes
that achieving a political solution would contribute to
stability and security in the Sahel region; and, fourthly,
that it encourages the parties to demonstrate greater
political will in their efforts to find a way to continue the
negotiation process and recognizes that consolidation
of the status quo is unacceptable, as others have also
said this morning.

In that context, we would like to specifically
encourage the parties to abide by the resolution's
provisions, take them into full account and ensure that
tangible progress is achieved by holding negotiations
without further delay on a referendum on the self-
determination of the people of Western Sahara.
