Mr. Oh Joon (Republic of Korea): Since the issue
of the Kenyan cases at the International Criminal Court
(ICC) was brought to the attention of the Council,
my delegation has had thorough deliberations on the
issue in consultation with other Council members.
Throughout the process, my delegation has been greatly
benefitted by the close cooperation and partnership
rendered by African members in the Council and other
members of the African Group in the United Nations.
The dialogue with the high-level Contact Group of the
African Union (AU) last month, in particular, helped us
to better understand the situation in Kenya as it faces
various security challenges, as well as its efforts to
fight international terrorism and to move ahead with
the national reconciliation process.

We also found the AU's concern over the issue to
be genuinely legitimate. However, my delegation came
to reaffirm its conclusion that the Security Council
is not the right venue to deal with this issue, and that
ICC issues had better be addressed in the framework of
the ICC, not least considering the upcoming Assembly
of States Parties to the Rome Statute of the ICC. It is
desirable not to set a precedent of the Security Council's
involvement in the ICC's legal process. We believe
that this will be in the best interest of the ICC, of the
Security Council and, eventually, of the whole United
Nations membership. For that reason, my delegation
decided to abstain in the voting.
