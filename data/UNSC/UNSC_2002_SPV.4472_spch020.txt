The President (spoke in Spanish): I note that the
comments of the representative of Portugal were made
on behalf of the troika of the Russian Federation, the
United States of America and Portugal.

I now give the floor to Mr. Oshima to respond to
the observations made and the questions asked by
members of the Council.
