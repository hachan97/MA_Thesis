Ms. Mulvein (United Kingdom): I simply wish
to point out, in response to the statement made by the
representative of the Sudan, that the Court is in fact
carrying out a preliminary examination into the United
Kingdom's activities in Iraq, and that the United
Kingdom is fully cooperating with the Court in relation
to that preliminary examination. We do not accept that
the Court is simply targeting African States. The Court
is not targeting States as such at all. It is carrying out
the mandate conferred on it by the Rome Statute and in
the case of referrals by the Council.
