Mr. Soemirat (Indonesia): Let begin by thanking you, Sir, in your capacity as the Chair of the Security Council Committee pursuant to resolution 751 (1992), concerning Somalia, for your important briefing. I would like to reaffirm our support for your leadership and work as Chair. I would like to share several points in that regard. First, we commend your efforts as Chair to contribute towards the resetting of relations between the Federal Government of Somalia and the Panel of Experts. As we said on previous occasions, dialogue and cooperation between Somalia and the Panel, based on mutual respect, are key for the Panel's success in discharging its mandate. We encourage continued confidence-building exercises between the Government of Somalia and the Panel and are heartened by the recent engagement and visit to Mogadishu by the Coordinator of the Panel. Secondly, Indonesia continues to support the Panel's work priorities for 2020. As we stated during the briefing on Somalia earlier this week (see S/PV.8731), we are concerned by the ongoing threat of Al-Shabaab. We welcome in particular the expanded focus on Al-Shabaab's revenue sources. We look forward to seeing concrete recommendations to effectivelycut Al-Shabaab off from its sources of weapons and financing. Thirdly, we feel the need to continue raising awareness of the purpose of the sanctions regime. We concur with the statement of the Chair that the sanctions regime is not static; it must be used only as a means to support a wider political strategy and peace process. It must therefore have a clear, transparent and measurable timetable. We would like to reiterate that its ultimate objective is to support, ensure and maintain security and stability in Somalia. I wish to reaffirm Indonesia's solidarity with Somalia in achieving long-term peace and stability, as well as our respect for Somalia's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
