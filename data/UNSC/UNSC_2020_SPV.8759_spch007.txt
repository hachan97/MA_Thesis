Mr. De Riviere (France) (spoke in French): France welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 2543 (2020), which renews the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) and would like to thank Germany and Indonesia for the efforts they made in their capacity as co-authors of the resolution. The resolution sends a strong signal as the peace talks begin. First, the peace process can be sustainably successful only if the democratic and human rights accomplishments of the past 20 years are preserved, including in particular the full, active and effective participation of women in the process and the protection of children. Secondly, a reduction in the level of violence is necessary for dialogue. The Taliban must honour its commitments by publicly cutting their ties with international terrorist organizations, in particular with Al-Qaida, as they did with Da'esh, in line with the Doha agreement of 29 February. Thirdly, only a combat against the scourge of drug trafficking coupled with efforts to support in parallel the country's economic and social development will result in the sustainable development of Afghanistan. Lastly, the peace negotiations, which France stands ready to support, must take into account the interests and rights of the victims of the conflict and of terrorism in Afghanistan. These are the conditions that are necessary for the lasting stabilization of the country and for the security of one and all.
