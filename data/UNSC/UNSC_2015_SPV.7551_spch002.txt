Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We voted in favour of resolution 2245 (2015),
prepared by the delegation of the United Kingdom,
to change the mandate of the United Nations Support
Office to the African Union Mission in Somalia
(UNSOA), as we, like other members of the Council,
are interested in seeing the swift establishment of
sustainable peace and stability both in that country and
in the Horn of Africa region as a whole.

However, we note the extreme density of the text
of the resolution pertaining to resources that we think
should be minimized. That is particularly important
given the fact that the provision of technical and
material support to UNSOA - now the United Nations
Support Office in Somalia - is among the issues most
often raised made by auditors of the Organization.

We also call attention to the very tight time frames
for the drafting of the resolution and the need to support
the provisional rules of procedure and the established
working practices of the Security Council with regard
to such types of documents, whereby amendments can
be made to a draft resolution right up to the voting, and
its publication in blue does not automatically mean that
the drafting is at an end.

We also believe that the deployment of Government
staff remains in the grey zone of administrative and
budgetary control, and we are concerned about it as a
matter of principle.
