Mr. Konuzin (Russia) (spoke in Russian): As I
recall, the elections in Guinea-Bissau were scheduled
for 14 October and some money was allocated by the
donors to prepare for these elections. I am interested in
knowing whether you have some information, whether
this money actually reached its destination and has it
begun to be spent? Has there been some preparatory
work for the elections, such as the registration of
voters? Is more money needed to prepare for the
elections?

I understand that it may not be possible to
provide an immediate reply today, but I would be very
grateful to the Secretariat if, the next time we receive a
briefing on this subject, it could provide a rather
detailed account of how the United Nations and its
agencies are participating in the democratic process in
Guinea-Bissau and of what means are available and
what resources are required.
