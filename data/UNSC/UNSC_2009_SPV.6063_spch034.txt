Prince Al-Faisal (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): Today raises our hopes for a new path in the
work of the Security Council. The Security Council has
shouldered its responsibility to put an end to the
tragedy taking place in Gaza. It is our hope that the
step taken this evening will pave the way to resolving
it. By adopting resolution 1860 (2009), the Security
Council is restoring confidence in the machinery of
peacemaking. We hope that all parties will see this as
an achievement for international peace and security
and that it will serve as a model for addressing any

future crises that may arise. However, the real joy is
not what we have achieved here but that which will be
felt in Gaza, where it is hoped that our achievement
today will save many human lives.

We must always remember that the Security
Council has served the people, alleviated their
suffering and contributed to their well-being, and that
it is not a device to be manipulated by States. What the
Security Council achieved today is the result of the
efforts and goodwill of all participants. Yet, when we
recall the high cost and the loss of human lives, it
limits our sense of pride in this accomplishment.
Success always has a price and in this case it was a
little too high. Thus, we hope that this achievement
will be blessed and built upon.

In conclusion, we hope that all parties will abide
by the resolution so that we can build a durable and
just settlement to a conflict that has bedevilled the
Middle East and cost it heavily for so long.
