The President: I thank the representative of
Brazil for his kind words addressed to me. We fully
concur with the view that regional organizations are the
most effective tool of conflict prevention. Their efforts
should be targeted to addressing the root causes of any
conflict and instability worldwide. I also welcome the
representative of Brazil's remarks about early warning,
the contribution of non-governmental organizations
and the media in that respect.
