Mr. Dangue Rewaka (Gabon) (spoke in French): I
wish to thank you, Mr. President, for having taken the
welcome initiative of organizing this meeting. The
delegation of Gabon supports the efforts made by
Ambassador Fowler, the Chairman of the Security
Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 864
(1993), of 15 September 1993, to render more effective
the sanctions imposed against UNITA. I wish to assure
him once again of the full cooperation of my delegation
in the discharge of his mandate.

We eagerly await the conclusions and
recommendations of the panels established by resolution
1237 (1999). Every effort should be made so that the
people of Angola can once again enjoy peace and concord

 

and devote their efforts to the economic and social
development of their country.

We share the view expressed by Ambassador Fowler
in paragraph 23 of his second report (S/ 1999/829), dated 28
July 1999, to the Council. We, like him, are convinced that
it is through political dialogue and not through force of
arms that an end can be put to the conflict that has been
tearing Angola asunder for more than two decades now.
