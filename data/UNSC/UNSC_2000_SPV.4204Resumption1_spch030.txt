Mr. Ould Deddach (Mauritania) (spoke in Arabic): I wish at the outset to thank you, Mr.
President, for your response to the call to convene this
urgent important meeting following the grave events
witnessed in the occupied Palestinian territories, which
have led to the death of 60 Palestinians and more than
2,000 wounded. The Government and people of
Mauritania wish to express their full solidarity with the
Palestinian people. We bow before the martyrs who fell
defending the legitimate rights of the Palestinian
peoples, Al-Quds Al-Sharif and the Islamic and Arab
ummah.

We wish to express our thorough condemnation
of the events we have witnessed - the premeditated
firing upon defenceless civilians and the use of cannon,
helicopter gunships, tanks, missiles, and live
ammunition, a clear violation of the Fourth Geneva
Convention of 1949. We call on the United Nations to
condemn these acts and to investigate in order to arrest
and prosecute the perpetrators.

You are aware, undoubtedly, Mr. President, that
these grave events are an obstacle to achieving peace in
this region, a region in dire need of peace. On behalf of
my delegation, I reaffirm our support for the peace
process. We believe that a just, comprehensive and
lasting peace in the region can be achieved only
through the Madrid terms of reference, the principle of
land for peace and the full implementation of Security
Council resolutions, thus ensuring full Israeli
withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territories
and reclaiming the legitimate national rights of the
Palestinian people, primarily their right to self-
determination and the establishment of their own State
with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.

These grave events may well finally drive the last
nail into the coffin of peace in the Middle East. Today,
more than ever, the international community must
intensify its efforts to overcome obstacles to just,
lasting and comprehensive peace in the region.
