Mr. Cerdenas (Argentina) (interpretation from Spanish): The actions of the leaders of the Bosnian Serbs
against, in general, the safe areas established by this
Council and, in particular, against the civilian population of
Sarajevo, had exceeded all the limits of humanitarian law
and taken the unacceptable road of uncommon cruelty. My
delegation therefore understands that the joint action of the
forces of the United Nations and of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) now under way became,
unfortunately, inevitable as a means of attempting to put an
end to the fiery siege that again and again spilled
Sarajevo's blood.

The cruelty to which I referred included, let us recall,
the unprecedented and shameful abuses recently heaped
upon the Blue Helmets themselves, to the astonishment of
the entire international community. Lack of respect for the
norms and limits established by the Security Council must
end once and for all. All the parties must assume their
respective obligations. We are all pledged to the
attainment of that objective.

However, hope for peace seems to have been reborn
today in Geneva. It must still be consolidated, step by
step, through negotiations, and this will not be easy.

None the less, we can begin to see the possibility of
a logic of peace, built upon a political solution, which
gives us reason for optimism. Only by travelling that road
with an open heart will we be able to reach a lasting
solution.
