The President (spoke in French): There are no more names inscribed on the list of speakers. Before adjourning the meeting, as this is the last scheduled meeting of the Council for the month of February, I would like to express thank all members of the Council for their cooperation during what was not only a particularly busy month but also a very productive one on several matters. I would also like to thank the Council secretariat for its continuous, highly effective support. I would also like to thank the teams of conference service officers, interpreters, translators, verbatim reporters and security staff for their work. As we end our presidency, I know that I speak on behalf of all Council members in wishing the delegation of China good luck as it assumes the presidency for the month of March. The meeting rose at 5.40 p.m.
