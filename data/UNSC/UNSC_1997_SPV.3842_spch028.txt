The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank
the representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina for his
statement and for his very kind words regarding Costa
Rica, and in particular regarding the members of the
Permanent Mission of my country here in New York.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Pakistan. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
