Mr. Biagini (Italy): I thank Under-Secretary-
General Lacroix for his comprehensive briefing.

Italy is deeply worried by the worsening of the
security and humanitarian situation in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, in particular in the Kasai
provinces. The spillover effect of the situation on the
stability ofthe region should also not be underestimated.
We are equally concerned by the shrinking of the
democratic space in the country and human rights
violations. The Government of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo has the primary responsibility to
respect and protect the rights of all of its citizens. We
encourage it to fulfil its obligations, including those to
hold accountable the perpetrators of violence.

At the political level, Italy remains convinced that
the full implementation of the 31 December agreement
continues to be the only viable and agreed political road
map, and is therefore key to sustaining the legitimacy
of transitional institutions. That transition must lead the
country towards democratic and transparent elections,
to be help as soon as possible and in compliance with
the constitution and the 31 December agreement. In
that connection, the Independent National Electoral
Commission's declarations today are not encouraging.
We call on the Government and Congolese political
forces to speed up the preparation of credible, peaceful
and inclusive elections conducive to a democratic
transfer of power.

In conclusion, let me renew Italy's full support for
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General
and the United Nations Organization Stabilization
Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Both
play a vital role in the country.
