Mr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon) (spoke in French): This morning, my delegation learned of the
airplane crash that occurred in Pakistan, in which the
Afghan Minister of Mines and Industry, a high official
of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Pakistan and
other officials of the two countries died. Under these
sad circumstances, my delegation would like to express
its deepest sympathy to the Ambassadors of Pakistan
and of Afghanistan.

My delegation thanks the three speakers - Mr.
Guehenno, Ambassador Nishimura of Japan and
Ambassador Braun of Germany - for their very
informative briefings.
We have two questions to ask. On 22 February in
Tokyo, the conference on Disarmament,
Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) in
Afghanistan was held. On that occasion, several
bilateral and multilateral donors confirmed their wish
to support a DDR programme in that country. We
welcome that.

Turning to my first question, I am concerned
about possible links between the pledges made at Oslo
and immediately thereafter and the commitments made
at Tokyo. In other words, are the resources earmarked
for the implementation of DDR to be additional
resources or are they to be deducted from the $2 billion
that has been pledged to Afghanistan as part of the
Oslo process for 2003?

My second comment has to do with the links to
be established between the functioning of the justice
system - in particular as regards the functioning of
the Judicial Commission - and eliminating insecurity,
especially in connection with dealing with rebel
warlords and the territory under their control. The
briefers have referred to the debate that has taken place
in Afghanistan. Do they believe that more emphasis
should be placed on promoting peace and security
rather than on consolidating the rule of law? How can
those two aspects be reconciled given the atmosphere
of clientism and the growing influence of warlords and
their allies?

Those are the two questions I wanted to share
with the members of the Council.
