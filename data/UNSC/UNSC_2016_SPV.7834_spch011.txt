Mr. Martins (Angola): We would first like to thank
the Secretary-General for his briefing, and to express
our solidarity with his efforts to stop any atrocities
being committed in the city ofAleppo against civilians,
including women and children.

It is our collective responsibility to ensure that
all parties to the conflict avoid targeting civilians and
that they abide by international humanitarian law and
human rights law. Aleppo, and especially its civilian
population, has suffered enough. The Government and
the opposition have a difficult task ahead of them that
will require a great deal of dialogue and coordination
if the civilians trapped between their forces are to be
spared death and suffering. That is the only way that
the carnage in Aleppo can be stopped and a move
begun towards a political solution. We strongly urge the
parties to choose the path of dialogue rather than that of
violence, including the detention, torture and killing of
combatants as well as civilians.
