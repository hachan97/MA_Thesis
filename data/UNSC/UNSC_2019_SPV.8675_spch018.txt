Mr. Kuzmin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We would like to thank Mr. Khan and
Mr. Kachi. Our country has consistently supported
strengthening stability and security in Iraq. The main
role in that process lies of course with the Iraqi people
and Government. We are interested in eradicating the
threat posed by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant
(ISIL) and terrorism in general and are convinced
that countering that threat is possible only through
the broadest possible coordination among counter-
terrorism efforts.

At the same time, we are convinced that there is a
need for all those involved in combating terrorism in
Iraq to respect the sovereignty of the Government and
to coordinate their efforts with Iraq. Their actions must
be in line with the stated objectives, namely, combating
terrorism and assisting the Iraqi Government in
stabilizing the situation. For its part, politically and in
practice Russia will continue to support the efforts of
the Iraqi leadership to combat terrorism and to ensure
the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq.

We see the work of the United Nations Investigative
Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes Committed
by Da'esh/Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant to collect
evidence of crimes committed by ISIL in Iraq to be one
of the most elements of the overall counter-terrorism
strategy in the region.

I would also like to add a few more practical
comments to our statement in our closed consultations.
