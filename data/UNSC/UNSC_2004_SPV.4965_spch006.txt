Mr. Duclos (France) (spoke in French): I too
want to thank Mr. Kamalesh Sharma for his briefing;
we are sorry that he is leaving his post.

The Permanent Representative of Ireland will be
making a statement on behalf of the European Union,
with which my delegation fully associates itself.

Mr. President, you requested that we be as brief
as possible, so I shall not repeat previous speakers'
analysis, which reflected the fact that significant
progress has been achieved in Timor-Leste and that
that progress needs to be consolidated. Here, let me
note that, in our view, very careful consideration must
be given to combating impunity for serious crimes
committed in 1999.

We draw two conclusions from the analyses.
First, France supports a one-year extension of the
United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor
(UNMISET), with a modified mandate and reductions
in personnel. Secondly, in our view it is now very
important that an UNMISET exit strategy succeed; we
should try to define that exit strategy well in advance.
It is important that the next resolution include a
number of elements: setting a deadline for the
withdrawal of the force; refocusing the mandate on
assistance to the Timorese authorities to enable them to
carry out reforms; a system for reviewing personnel
levels at the end of the year; and strengthened
coordination of the international community's action so
as to ensure a smooth handover to transition and
development partners, such as the relevant United
Nations agencies, international financial institutions
and bilateral partners.
