Mr. Alotaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): Kuwait
voted against draft resolution S/2018/520. At the
outset, I would like to underscore that our vote does
not mean that we do not condemn all acts of violence
targeting civilians. We have stressed that in our
previous statements in meetings on the situation in the
occupied territories, including the Palestinian question.
We condemn all acts of violence targeting civilians
committed by anyone, anywhere and at any time.

However, the draft resolution submitted by the
United States that we have voted against is simply
biased in favour of the Israeli occupying Power. It
justifies its illegal and illegitimate practices and
policies in the occupied territories. It turns a blind eye
to the recent tragic events and massacres perpetrated
by the occupation forces against dozens of civilians and
peaceful protesters. It encourages the occupying Power
to continue its illegitimate practices and violations of
the relevant international law and Security Council
resolutions. It includes no reference to protecting
Palestinian civilians, lifting the blockade on Gaza
or even reducing the restrictions on the movement of
goods and people. Moreover, the right to self-defence
should not apply to the aggressor and occupier. The
draft resolution should therefore call for an end to the
occupation. For those reasons, we voted against the
draft resolution.
