Ms. Guadey (Ethiopia): We would also like to
thank the delegations of the United States, Japan and
the Republic of Korea for convening today's meeting.
I would also like to thank Assistant Secretary-General
Jenea for his briefing.

We join others in strongly condemning the latest
launch of an international intercontinental ballistic
missile by the Democratic Republic ofKorea in violation
of various Security Council resolutions. We concur
with the Secretary-General that this constitutes "a
dangerous escalation of the situation", which threatens
regional peace and security in the Korean peninsula.

It is absolutely essential that the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea cease its provocative actions
in order to reduce the tension in the Korean peninsula
and prevent the further escalation of the situation. We
would like to once again underscore the need for finding
lasting comprehensive political and diplomatic solutions
through dialogue and negotiation. This requires that
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea return to
its international commitments on denuclearization and
fully comply with relevant resolutions of the Security
Council. It is important that we maintain the unity of
the Council and speak with one voice in addressing this
issue, which is becoming extremely dangerous.

One thing makes us not lose hope: while there
might be differences as to methods and approaches,
there are in fact no differences in terms ofthe substance
of denuclearizing the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea. This cannot be stated enough.

Finally, the latest launch of a ballistic missile
by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a
reminder to all of us that the full implementation of
the Council's resolutions by all Members State is much
more critical now than ever before. I would like to
reaffirm the commitment of Ethiopia to continuing to
work towards the full implementation of these Security
Council resolutions.
