Mr. Delattre (France) (spoke in French): France
welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 2464
(2019), submitted by the United States, which I thank
for its commitment to this issue. The resolution allows
for the renewal of the mandate of the Panel of Experts
assisting the Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1718 (2006), which is responsible, under your
presidency, Sir, for the follow-up of sanctions against
North Korea. I offer our full support for and gratitude
to the German presidency of the Committee and the
Panel for their work. The experts, whose commitment
I wish to acknowledge, must in particular be able to
carry out their activities within the framework of the
mandate that we have established and reaffirmed.

The 1718 Committee and the Panel of Experts that
assists it are the main tools of the Council for verifying
the implementation of the sanctions and dissuading
all parties, starting with North Korea, from engaging
in activities to evade those sanctions. North Korea
continues to violate and circumvent sanctions with
greater scope and through methods that are increasingly
diverse and sophisticated, as confirmed by the latest
report of the panel (S/2019/171), published in March.

We therefore need more than ever a strict, complete
and universal implementation of the sanctions. Such
implementation is essential to preserving our leverage in
serious negotiations towards the complete, irreversible
and verifiable denuclearization of the North Korean
territory. France will remain fully committed to that.
