Mr. Gupta (India): I am constrained to take the
floor and put forward a statement of facts in response
to your comments, Sir, concerning the United Nations
Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan
(UNMOGIP).

UNMOGIP's role was to supervise the ceasefire
line established in Jammu and Kashmir as a result of
the Karachi Agreement of 1949. That ceasefire line
no longer exists, and a new ceasefire line came into
existence on 17 December 1971. Following a similar
agreement of 1972 between India and Pakistan, signed
by the Heads of the two Governments and ratified by
their respective Parliaments, the two countries resolved
to settle their differences by peaceful means through
bilateral negotiations. The agreement also stipulated
that the line of control resulting from the ceasefire
line of 17 December 1971 shall be respected by both
sides. Subsequently, the line of control was delineated
in J ammu and Kashmir pursuant to that agreement and
with approval of both Governments. Thus, UNMOGIP's
role has been overtaken by those developments.
