The President (spoke in French): As the
representative of Syria has referred to the mandate
that France exercised in Syria on behalf of the League
of Nations, I would recall that President Al-Assad's
grandfather was part of a delegation that, in 1936,
requested that France not grant Syria its independence.
We can provide the text of the petition that was signed
on that occasion. I will not add any more on that point,
but since he did refer to French authors, I would advise
him to meditate on Talleyrand, who said "what is
excessive is insignificant". What the representative of
Syria has said is truly excessive.

I now give the floor to the representative of Turkey.
