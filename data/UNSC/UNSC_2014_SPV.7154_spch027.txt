Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I shall not take up much ofthe Council's time.
I should just like to say two things.

First, the representative of Ukraine is far too easy
in characterizing his own people as bandits. The Right
Sector and those who say the demonstrators should be
killed are not bandits; they are simply the political elite
of Kyiv. Are not those who are protesting in eastern
Ukraine able to do so without Russia's say-so? Do they
need Russia to say that events in Kyiv are unacceptable
before they are able to grasp that? When radicals come
to tell the miners of that region that they will establish
their own order - surely the miners can understand
that without a hint from Russia? Are the protesters able
to understand how bad things have become only when
Russian agents come to explain the situation to them?
Do their own life experience and understanding of the
situation in their own country count for nothing? How
will those things influence them?

Secondly, with regard to the statement made by my
American colleague Ms. Power, she did not mention
her view on the decree to use armed force in eastern
Ukraine. I hope that, as the Ukrainian representative
has called for, following today's discussion some
Western colleagues and partners will pick up the
telephone and call their leaders and those in Kyiv with
whom they enjoy influence, who may not act unless
they get the green light from Western capitals. I would
ask my colleagues to give them the red light and tell
them that problems can be resolved through dialogue
and not military confrontation.
