The President: I shall now make a statement in
my capacity as representative of Uganda.
I join Council members in thanking Special
Representative Ameerah Haq for her comprehensive
briefing. I also welcome the participation of the
Permanent Representative of Timor-Leste and thank
her for her statement.

We commend the Government and people of
Timor-Leste for the steady progress being made in
advancing peace, stability and development, in spite of
the remaining challenges. The revitalization of the
economy, as evidenced by the projected economic
growth of 10.4 per cent in 2010, provides a sound basis
for socio-economic development. We note that the
Government, with the support of the International
Labour Organization, is taking steps to address the
challenges of high unemployment, especially among
young people, by providing skills development through
vocational training.

We welcome the continued strengthening of
Timorese institutions. The formulation of the National
Strategic Development Plan for the next 10 years is a
step in the right direction. It is encouraging that the
Plan is receiving feedback from the whole country,
reinforcing national ownership of the Plan.

The resumption of policing responsibilities by the
Timor-Leste national police is welcome. It is essential
that there be sustainable institutional development for
the national police through training and logistical
support. We welcome the measures taken by the United
Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) to
enhance police capacity. The ongoing recruitment of
19 civilian experts within UNMIT police to enhance
skills-building and institutional development in the
national police is also welcome. It is important that
that exercise be concluded in a timely manner.

Finally, we thank the Special Representative and
the UNMIT staff, as well as the country team, for their
good work.

I resume my function as President of the Council.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Malaysia.
