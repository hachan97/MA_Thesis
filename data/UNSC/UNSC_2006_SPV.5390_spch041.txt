The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the
delegation of Colombia for supporting my delegation
in its call to address this matter in plenary meeting.
Given that there are still a considerable number
of speakers remaining on my list, I intend to suspend
the meeting until 3 p.m.

The meeting was suspended at 1.30 p.m.
