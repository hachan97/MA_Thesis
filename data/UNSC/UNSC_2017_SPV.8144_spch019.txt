Mr. Vitrenko (Ukraine): We regret that, despite
numerous references to the General Assembly in its
statements, the Russian delegation does not follow the
work of that organ and the developments there - or,
perhaps even worse, it is just intentionally addressing
that body, the main organ of the United Nations
representing the collective voice of all the States
Members of the United Nations, with complete disdain.

Just yesterday, the General Assembly reaffirmed
the shameful status of the Russian Federation as an
occupying Power in Ukraine (see A/72/PV.73), and, by
extension, as a party to the international conflict. In
that respect, we would like to simply repeat what has
already been stated in the Security Council on numerous
occasions. As an occupying Power and a party to the
dispute, and as an authoritarian regime under one of the
highest number of bilateral and multilateral sanctions
in the world, Russia, by virtue of the Charter of the
United Nations, has neither the legal nor moral right to
pronounce itself on Ukraine at the Council, let alone
to lecture my delegation, or that of any other Member
State. That will at least be the case until Russia returns
Crimea to the Ukraine, withdraws its troops from
the Donbas and pays in full for the damage done by
its occupation.
