Mr. Kumalo (South Africa): Allow me also to
thank Mr. Holmes for his briefing and to welcome our
colleague, the Permanent Representative of Chad, to
this meeting.

I think that other speakers have made it clear that
we support the humanitarian workers, who are really
the face of the United Nations on the ground, and we
worry about their safety in that very difficult
environment.

We wish to reiterate that the final solution will
come about when we have both a political process in
place on the ground and the security that is necessary.
We are delighted by the normalization of relations
between Chad and the Sudan and hope that this
normalization will lead these two friendly countries to
find a way to resolve the problems between them.
