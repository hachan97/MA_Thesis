Mr. Qassem Agha (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): I will not take up too much of your time,
Mr. President.

As is his custom, the representative of the Saudi-
Wahhabi-expiatory regime that sponsors terrorism
worldwide has made a statement that is replete with
falsehoods and distorts the truth in a desperate attempt
to serve the interests of Israel by deviating from the
core of this agenda item, namely, ending the Israeli
occupation of Arab lands; to mislead the international
community as to the truth of what is taking place in
my country, Syria, regarding the achievements of the
Syrian army and its allies in facing the war of terrorism
that has been imposed on us for six years; and to cover
up what the Bani Saud regime is doing by becoming
allies with Israel and certain sheikhdoms and kingdoms
ofthe Gulfregion, as well as Governments ofthat region
and others, in supporting and financing armed groups.

The representative of the Saudi regime pretended
to have forgotten to mention that the terrorism
prevailing throughout the world is nothing but the
result of the adoption by the ruling regime in the Bani
Saud kingdom of an extremist religious doctrine and its
promotion worldwide by supporting religious centres
on which it spends billions of dollars annually to
spread Wahhabism, a doctrine based on the rejection
of others, charging them with infidelity and condoning
their killing.

Since the onset ofthe terrorism war imposed on my
country, Syria, we have warned against the fact that the
terrorism affecting our country originates in certain
States of the Gulf area, particularly Saudi Arabia
and Qatar. Today, after more than six years of our
analysis, some are now saying that Qatar is a sponsor
of terrorism. 1, in turn, say to the representative of the
Saudi regime that the day will inevitably come when
his country will be described as a key State sponsor
of terrorism, and the victims of terrorism in Syria and
the world will confront him and everyone who has
supported terrorism in Syria and the world and will
hold them accountable, wherever they are.
