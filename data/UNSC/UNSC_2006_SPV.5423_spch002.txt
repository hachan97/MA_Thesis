Mr. Dolgov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation did not feel it was
possible to support the adoption of the resolution on
applying sanctions to four Sudanese persons. In taking
this decision, we were guided by thoughts we have
frequently set out in the Security Council.

There is no doubt that the violation of
international norms, including international
humanitarian law, should not go unpunished. However,
we believe that the present round of peace negotiations
on Darfur in Abuja should be concluded by the
Sudanese parties signing all the peace agreements up to
30 April 2006, as was determined by the African
Union. In our View, there is the feeling that the
adoption of this resolution might have a negative
impact on the prospects for concluding a peace
agreement within the time period and thus would not
promote the efforts of the international community to
establish peace and stability in Darfur and in the Sudan
as a whole. We are convinced that, within the Sudanese
context and also in broader terms, the implementation
of sanctions should be closely linked with the task of
promoting the process of a political settlement of the
conflict and ensuring regional stability.
