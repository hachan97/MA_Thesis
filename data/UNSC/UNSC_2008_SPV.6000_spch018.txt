Mr. Suescum (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): We
welcome President Guelleh and the Minister for
Foreign Affairs of Djibouti, as well as Ambassador
Desta of Eritrea, and thank them for being with us
today and for their briefings.

We view Eritrea's presence and participation in
today's meeting, and Mr. Ping's visit to Asmara on
behalf of the African Union, as signals that Eritrea
intends to interact much more actively with the
international community - the only way to achieve a
peaceful solution to the conflict. In that respect, we
urge Eritrea to respond to the good offices of the
Secretary-General, which we fully support, and to the
efforts of the African Union in particular. We further
urge Eritrea to honour its obligations under the United
Nations Charter and to heed the appeals of the Security
Council, inter alia, to withdraw its troops in order to
return to the status quo ante and to create a positive
climate for dialogue between the parties and the
potential facilitation of the mediators.

The Council can act only on the basis of the facts
provided to it by the parties to a conflict. If the
situation continues without the cooperation of one
party, the United Nations will have no choice but to
defend the territorial integrity of Djibouti. In the light
of the contacts and dialogue that have taken place,
Djibouti appears to be the threatened party and to be
fulfilling its obligations under the Charter.
