Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We would like to convey our gratitude to our
colleagues in the Security Council for the constructive
approach and effective cooperation they demonstrated
during their work on resolution 2199 (2015), which
was just adopted. We would also like to thank all the
delegations that sponsored the resolution, initially
submitted to the Council by the Russian Federation. We
believe that this type of case clearly shows the need to
use collective efforts to resolve the issues we face.

Having adopted resolution 2199 (2015), we have
taken yet another important step in suppressing the
financing of terrorists, first and foremost through
the illegal trafficking of oil, and in suppressing the
terrorist threat faced by Syria, Iraq and other States in
the Middle East, whose impact is felt far beyond the
borders of the region.
