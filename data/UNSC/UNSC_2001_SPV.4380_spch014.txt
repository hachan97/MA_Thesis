Ms. Lee (Singapore): Ijoin others in thanking the
Representative of the Secretary-General, General
Cisse, and Mr. Calderisi for their excellent briefings.

I wish to make only three brief points. First, in
paragraph 29 of his report, the Secretary-General has
made specific proposals on the areas where the
mandate of the United Nations Peace-building Support
Office in the Central African Republic (BONUCA)
could be strengthened, and for the extension of its
mandate for another year. While we are fully
supportive of these proposals, we would like to caution
that any decision to strengthen BONUCA should be
commensurate with its ability to achieve tangible
results. In other words, BONUCA must be given the
capacity to carry out a strengthened mandate
effectively. Otherwise, we run the risk of damaging its
credibility should it fail to meet the expectations on the
ground.

Secondly, even as we work toward political
reconciliation, we must also focus on the root causes of
the problem. The Council addressed these areas in its
presidential statement of 17 July 2001. I need not
repeat them, but we would like to encourage the
international community to include, in its assistance
packages to the Central African Republic, training in
the form of technical and management expertise. In our
View, this would lay the foundation for the long-term
economic viability of the country.

Finally, we need to consider the consequential
effects of the presence of refugees in the Central
African Republic over the long term. It is already in a
precarious economic situation. That it should also bear
the burden of hosting refugees from its neighbours in
the region only adds to this precarious situation. In
fact, the Secretary-General has pointed out that there is
a sort of inter-refugee problem faced by the region as a
whole, and this is a threat to the security of the
subregion. We urge that efforts to address this problem
also be treated as a matter of high priority.
