The President (spoke in Russian): There are no
more names inscribed on the list of speakers.

Since this is the last meeting of the Council for the
month of June 2014, before inviting Council members
to informal consultations to continue our discussion
on the subject, on behalf of the delegation of the
Russian Federation I would like to express our sincere
appreciation to the members of the Council, especially
my colleagues the Permanent Representatives, their
staffs and the Secretariat of the Council, for all the
support they have given us.

It has been a very busy month, and we succeeded
in reaching consensus on a number of important issues
within our purview. We could not have done it alone
or without the hard work, support and constructive
contributions of every delegation and the representatives
of the Secretariat, as well the interpreters, translators,
meeting services staff and sound engineers. As we
wind up our presidency, on behalf of the whole Council
I wish the delegation of Rwanda success in its work
presiding over the Council in July.

The meeting rose at10.35 a.rn.
