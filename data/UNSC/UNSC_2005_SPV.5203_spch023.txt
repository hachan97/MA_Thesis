Mr. Zacklin: I listened very carefully to the
statements that were made by the members of the
Council in support of the Kalomoh report and its
recommendations, and I paid particular attention to the
statement by the Minister of Justice of Burundi, and in
particular his confirmation that Burundi supports those
recommendations. That is particularly important in the

context of the question of national ownership, which,
as I said in my own statement, is of vital importance to
the success or failure of any accountability mechanism
that we might put in place.

The report of the Secretary-General and the
recommendations are, of course, only a beginning.
They are really a blueprint, and it is quite obvious that
there are quite a number of points that require further
elucidation, some of which have been mentioned this
afternoon, including, for example, questions of timing
and questions of funding. The Secretariat will provide
the information in response to those questions as we
proceed in the next stage of the process. They are not
easy questions to deal with, but we would be prepared
to provide that information as soon as we are in a
position to have further discussions with the
Government of Burundi.

The Secretary-General has made it clear that he
wishes the Secretariat to proceed as soon as possible
with the implementation of the recommendations, and
we look forward to having further discussions with the
representatives of the Government of Burundi shortly.
