Mr. Qin Huasun (China) (interpretation from Chinese): The Israeli Government's decision to carry out its
plan of expansion in Jerusalem has aroused widespread
concern in the international community. At present, when
all sides concerned are making positive efforts to promote
the further development of the peace process in the Middle
East, the Israeli plan to unilaterally change the status quo
of Jerusalem runs counter to these efforts and is bound to
lead to the further complication of the situation in the
Middle East region. We would like to express our concern
about the development of this situation.

The Chinese Government has always believed that the
settlement of the question of Jerusalem should be carried
out through peaceful negotiations by all sides concerned, on
the basis of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.
We believe that the key to the settlement of the Middle
East question lies in the implementation of the relevant
resolutions of the United Nations, the principle of land for
peace and the effective implementation of the agreements
that have been reached between Israel and Arab countries.

At present, the Middle East peace process has come to
a sensitive and crucial point. We appeal to all sides
concerned to cherish the hard-won peaceful situation,
strictly abide by the relevant resolutions of the United
Nations with regard to Jerusalem and the Oslo agreements
and cease all actions that may lead to the deterioration of
the situation so that the Middle East peace process can
emerge from the current deadlock as soon as possible and
lead to the creation of the conditions necessary for an early,
comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the question
of the Middle East.
