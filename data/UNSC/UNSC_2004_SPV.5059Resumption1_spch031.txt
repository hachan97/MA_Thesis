The President: Thank you, Ambassador Denisov.
After consultations among members of the Security
Council, I have been authorized to make the following
statement on behalf of the Council,

"The Security Council welcomes the
briefing by the Chairman of the CTC on the work
of the Committee.

"The Security Council reaffirms that
terrorism in all its forms and manifestations
constitutes one of the most serious threats to
peace and security and that any acts of terrorism
are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their
motivation, whenever and by whomsoever
committed.

"The Security Council recalls the statement
by its President on 19 July 2004
(S/PRST/2004/26), resolution 1535 (2004), which
indicated the Council's intention to review the
structure and activities of the CTC, and resolution
1566 (2004) emphasizing additional measures
aimed at strengthening international cooperation
in combating terrorism.

"The Security Council invites the CTC to
pursue its agenda as set out in the work
programme for the CTC's thirteenth 90-day
period (S/2004/820) focusing on practical
measures to implement resolution 1535 (2004) on
the revitalization of the Committee, including
implementation of the organizational plan for the
Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate, and
resolution 1566 (2004). These measures will
embrace further work to increase the Committee's
capacity, including through enhanced cooperation
with the Al Qaeda/Taliban Sanctions Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999)
and the Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1540 (2004).

"The Security Council notes the importance
of continuing the CTC's efforts to enhance the
capabilities of Member States to combat
terrorism; to identify and address the problems
faced by States in implementing resolution 1373
(2001); to facilitate the provision of technical
assistance adjusted to the countries' needs; to
encourage the largest possible number of States
to become parties to the international conventions
and protocols related to counter-terrorism, and to
strengthen its dialogue and cooperation with
international, regional and subregional
organizations acting in the areas outlined by
resolution 1373 (2001).

"The Security Council invites the CTC to
continue preparing and begin sending to Member
States assessments of their assistance needs for
eventual sharing with interested donor States and
organizations, and to accelerate the preparations
for the first visits to Member States, with their
consent, in order to enhance the monitoring of the
implementation of resolution 1373 (2001) and
facilitate the provision of technical and other
assistance for such implementation.

"The Security Council, recalling paragraph
7 of resolution 1566 (2004), invites the CTC to
start, in consultation with relevant international,
regional and subregional organizations and
United Nations bodies, to develop a set of best
practices to assist States in implementing the
provisions of resolution 1373 (2001) related to
the financing of terrorism.

"The Security Council notes that, as of 30
September 2004, 78 States had not submitted
their respective reports to the CTC on time as set
out in resolution 1373 (2001). It calls on them
urgently to do so, in order to maintain the
universality of response which resolution 1373
(2001) requires.
"The Security Council invites the CTC to
continue reporting on its activities at regular
intervals and expresses its intention to review the
structure and activities of the CTC in January
2005."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2004/37.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 5.15pm.
