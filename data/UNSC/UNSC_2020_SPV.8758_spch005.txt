Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation abstained in the voting on resolution 2542 (2020), on the extension of the mandate of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), submitted by the United Kingdom. We abstained because not all our amendments of principle were reflected in the text. In our approach to the Libyan settlement, we have consistently proceeded on the basis that solutions proposed to Libya can be implemented only if the Libyan sides agree to them. This is a fundamental principle enshrined in Security Council resolutions. It is the Libyans themselves alone who should determine the future of their country. I recall that we said this when we were adopting resolution 2510 (2020). This principle should apply to all the decisions, including those concerning the monitoring of a cessation of hostilities - that is, UNSMIL. As soon as the Libyans agree on it within the existing dialogue mechanism, such monitoring should be carried out at the request of and with the agreement of the Libyan parties. We underscore our unflagging support for United Nations efforts, including those of UNSMIL, to move the Libyan settlement process forward. Russia shares the international consensus that the United Nations has a central role to play in this process. We express the hope that in the very near future, we will see the appointment of a Special Envoy and Head of UNSMIL.
