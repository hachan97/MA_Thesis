Prince Zeid Ra'ad Zeid Al-Hussein (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): I should like to extend to you, Sir,
and to the members of the Security Council our sincere
thanks and appreciation for your adoption of a
presidential statement strongly condemning the
terrorist attacks on innocent civilians yesterday in
Amman. We also thank you for your expressions of
condolence and sympathy with the families of the
victims, the people and Government of my country.

In reiterating the determination of the Jordanian
Government to pursue the perpetrators and bring them
to justice, I reaffirm my country's commitment to
cooperating with the Security Council and to stepping
up its efforts to combat the scourge of terrorism, in
accordance with the United Nations Charter and
resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1624 (2005).
