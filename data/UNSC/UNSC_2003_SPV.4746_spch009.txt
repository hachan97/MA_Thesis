Mr. Onyia (Nigeria): I wish fully to align myself
with the statement made by the leader of the delegation
of Guinea, the Foreign Minister. He has said all that
needs to be said.

I wish simply to add that there is a need for us to
come together and for the Security Council to take
seriously the issue of Cote d'Ivoire. It is important,
because we cannot stand by and watch Cote d'Ivoire
deteriorate to the level of Sierra Leone before the
intervention of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group
(ECOMOG) and of the United Nations Mission in
Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL).

If we want to look at the problems of the
subregion holistically and ensure peace and stability
there, this is the time to come to the aid of Cote
d'Ivoire. Looking at the problem in Cote d'Ivoire will
contribute to the resolution of all the other problems
within the subregion.

I personally do not have anything to add to what
the leader of the delegation said earlier.
