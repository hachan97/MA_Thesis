The President (spoke in Spanish): As a result of
the consultations held among members of the Council,
I have been authorized to make the following statement
on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council met on 26 January
2004 to consider 'Post-conflict national
reconciliation: role of the United Nations'.
Members expressed their respective views and
understandings on, and reaffirmed the vital
importance of this matter, stressing the necessary
close cooperation needed in the United Nations
system, including the Council, on this issue.

"The statements underscored the important
tasks that must be addressed in post-conflict
situations in order to reach the goal of national
reconciliation, as well as the relevant experience
and expertise that exist within the United Nations
system and in the Member States.

"Members considered that it would be
appropriate to examine further how to harness
and direct this expertise and experience drawn up
from several key areas, so that it would be more
readily accessible to the Council, to the wider
United Nations system and membership, and to
the international community as a whole, so that
the lessons and experience of the past could be, as
appropriate, learned and built on.

"The Council invites the Secretary-General
to give consideration to the relevant views
expressed in this debate in preparation of his
report on the role of the United Nations in justice
and the rule of law.

"The Council invites all Members of the
United Nations, and other parts of the United
Nations system with relevant experience and
expertise to contribute to this process."

This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under symbol S/PRST/2004/2.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 7.10 pm.
