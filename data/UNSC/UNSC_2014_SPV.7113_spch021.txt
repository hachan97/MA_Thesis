Mr. Medina Gonzalez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):
Cuba reiterates its unwavering commitment to the
values of equity, solidarity and social justice, both at
the national level and through the establishment of a
democratic and just international order.

First of all, allow me clearly to state that, in Cuba's
opinion, we are not referring here to a new category or
a new concept. What today is called the rule of law at
the international level is simply the full observance of
the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United
Nations and the principles of international law.

Regardless of what we call it, respect for the
sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity
of States, refraining from the use or the threat of
use of force, the self-determination of States and
non-interference in the internal affairs of States, as
clearly set out as early as 1970 in the Declaration on
Principles of International Law concerning Friendly
Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance
with the Charter of the United Nations, is the essential
foundation of international law and serves as a
prerequisite for the peaceful coexistence of nations for
the sake of achieving peace and development, which
should be our ultimate goal.

It is difficult to believe that the so-called rule oflaw
does exist in international relations when unilateralism
and economic, commercial and financial policies and
measures contrary to international law contravene
its essential foundations, as do actions aimed at
imposing regime change and aimed at interference
and intervention, including through the incitement to
internal conflict in sovereign States based on foreign
agendas of domination and hegemonic influence.

Paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Declaration of the high-
level meeting of the General Assembly on the rule of
law at the national and international levels (General Assembly resolution 67/1), adopted in September 2012,
clearly state that the sovereign equality of States, the
fulfilment in good faith of the obligations assumed by
them, the peaceful settlement of disputes, abstention
from the use or threat of use of force against the
territorial integrity or political independence of any
State and non-interference in the internal affairs of
other members of the international community are
basic principles that cannot be violated under any
circumstances.

Neither can it be denied that the promotion
and strengthening of the so-called rule of law also
presupposes respect for the institutions sovereignly
established in each State, without discrimination or
double standards, and recognition of the legitimate
right of peoples to create institutions relevant to their
historic evolution, their needs and their economic,
sociopolitical and cultural interests. No one can replace
or interfere in the determination of national authorities
to strengthen their respective political, economic and
legal arrangements and in the functioning of their
institutions. States owe obedience only to the sovereign
will of their peoples and the international obligations
undertaken in implementation of that will.

The reform of the United Nations in such a way
that it becomes a standard of transparency, democracy
and participation of the entire international community
in resolving pressing global problems is a fundamental
component of the rule of law at the international level.
That requires a truly democratic and participatory
United Nations, with a transparent and democratized
Security Council and a revitalized General Assembly
that assumes the central role in the realization ofthe right
of peoples and every human being to a just, democratic
and equitable international order and supports the
efforts of States in the sovereign construction of the
future decided upon by each nation for itself.

In addition, international institutions must also
be democratized in the economic, monetary and
financial spheres so that they become tools serving
the development of peoples and of every human being,
leaving behind their despicable role as the guardians of
opulence and selfishness. That will require systems of
rules and institutions, at the national and international
levels, that ensure full participation by peoples and
by every human being in the adoption of decisions
involving them, the implementation of programmes and
policies aimed at promoting and consolidating equity
and social justice and the realization of all rights for all
peoples and persons.

The attempt to impose formally perfect laws and
institutions under certain preconceived canons that
have been laid out by the centres of power and the
manipulation of matters of global importance, such as
the promotion and protection of human rights, not only
distort that concept but make it inapplicable.

Therefore, Cuba strongly condemns any measure,
policy or unilateral law that is contrary to international
law and any attempt to minimize the implementation
of article 28 of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, which states that everyone is entitled to a social
and international order in which the rights and freedoms
set forth in the Declaration can be fully realized.

Cuba reiterates its clear political will to keep
working with the other Member States for the
revitalization and strengthening of the Organization.
Cuba will remain committed to achieving a democratic
and equitable international order that responds to the
calls for peace, development and justice by peoples the
world over.
