Mr. Osman (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): I should
like to thank you, Sir, and the members of the Security
Council for giving us the opportunity to participate
in this meeting to adopt the technical resolution 2075
(2012) extending the mandate of the United Nations
Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA). I offer
my thanks to all the members of the Council for their
understanding and for adopting the resolution in its
current wording.

On my own behalf, I should like to assure the
Council that we in the Government of the Sudan
will work with our brothers in the Government of
South Sudan to reach a satisfactory resolution of the
situation in Abyei. I commend the language of the
resolution in that regard, urging both countries to
engage in negotiations with a view to reaching a final
settlement of the situation in Abyei. I should also like
to draw attention to the fact that the imposition of any
coercive or unilateral settlement that does not take the
sensitivities of the population groups and communities
in Abyei into account would not achieve peace, security
or stability in the region, which in my view is the most
important objective of the Governments of the Sudan
and South Sudan.

The Governments of the Sudan and South Sudan and
the members of the Security Council are all interested
in establishing security and peace and in creating an
environment conducive to the normalization of ties
between the two countries in a manner that would help
them implement the nine agreements recently finalized
in Addis Ababa.
