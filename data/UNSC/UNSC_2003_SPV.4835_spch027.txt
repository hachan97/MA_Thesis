The President: I thank the representative of San
Marino, and note the historic nature of his statement,
which was the first to be made to the Security Council
by his delegation. I am glad that he chose to speak on
justice and the rule of law, and I am sure I speak for the
whole Council in hoping that it will not be too long
before his delegation addresses the Council again.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Sweden.
