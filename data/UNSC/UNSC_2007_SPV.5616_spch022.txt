Mr. Solana: I would like to respond to the two
questions posed by the representative of the United
Kingdom. I believe that these two questions can be
answered very simply with a "yes" to question number
one and a "yes" to question number two.

But I would like to be a little more explicit. It is
true that the vocation of the European Union is to act
in coordination with others, and that has been our
manner of action in general terms. Of course,
sometimes we have to act on our own, but generally
our vocation is to cooperate with others in any
operation. We have done so with the African Union
16

with NATO and with the United Nations, in the first
place. To my mind, that is the answer to the first
question.

As for the second question, which is whether the
lessons that we have learned from the EUFOR can be
applied to other operations, whether in Africa or
elsewhere, the answer is also "yes". The structure of
force that we ourselves are organizing, as the
Ambassador has said, is a concept that is well prepared
for this type of rapid, efficient operation that can open
a way for others to follow. In any case, I think that
good lessons have already been drawn and more will
follow in the future. I hope very much that these
lessons will be useful in other parts of Africa where
there will be much need in the foreseeable future, in
particular in Darfur.
