Mr. Cunningham (United States of America): I
will be brief, as you requested, Sir, but I do want to
make a couple of points.

First, obviously we deplore and condemn the
violence and attacks that have taken place in the last
couple of months. I am afraid that this reminds all of us
again of the primacy of establishing the rule of law in
Kosovo. This is something that the United Nations
Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) is
working hard to achieve and which I hope we all will
support.

We believe that the way forward in general is to
focus on proceeding with the standards before status
approach. This appears to us to be well poised to go
ahead. We encourage UNMIK and those involved to
move ahead with it. The achievement of the standards
that have been set out is essential to a better life for all
Kosovars as we move forward and the United States,
for its part, will continue to offer technical expertise to
support that process.

We also urge the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General to convene officials from Belgrade
and Pristina as soon as possible in order to begin a
dialogue on practical matters. We think this is
important. These talks should be held primarily at the
level of technical experts and deal with practical issues
of mutual concern, such as energy and transportation.

I would also like to note that unilateral comments
or declarations by neighbouring Governments or
parties inside Kosovo about Kosovo's future are
premature and unhelpful. Attempts to prejudge final
status only distract from the important work at hand of
implementing the standards and beginning the direct
dialogue on practical matters. That is where the focus
should be, we believe. We hope that all leaders of the
region will focus on helping Mr. Holkeri as he sets
about his very important and complicated new tasks.
That certainly is the intention of my Government.
