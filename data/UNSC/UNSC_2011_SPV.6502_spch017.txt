Mr. Osorio (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I
should like to thank all my colleagues for the kind
words they have addressed to me. I should also like to
note that the work of the Committee is moving forward
in an atmosphere of great seriousness and
responsibility, given the sensitive nature of the matters
it addresses.

I should like, through you, Sir, and my
colleagues, to convey my gratitude to the Panel of
Experts for their contributions. As Council members
have also noted, the work of the Panel of Experts,
under the coordination of Ms. Zurabishvili, has been
truly outstanding. Its heavy workload and wide range
of activities have allowed the Panel very closely to
follow the implementation of resolution 1737 (2006)
and to identify violations or attempted violations of the
sanctions imposed by the Council.

I cannot conclude without also expressing my
appreciation to the members of the Secretariat for their
excellent support. They work tirelessly and with great
dedication to ensure that the Committee can fulfil its
tasks. We will continue to work thus to complete the
mandate entrusted to us.
