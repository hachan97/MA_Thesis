Mr. Osorio (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): On
behalf of Colombia, I wish to state my disappointment
and regret at the outcome of the vote, which denies the
member countries of the League of Arab States, and
this Organization itself, the support that has been
requested of us for a plan intended to bring an end to
the tragedy being experienced in Syria and to defend
the lives and rights of the people of that country.

Since the beginning of the violent repression by
the Syrian Government of the civilian population more
than ten months ago, we have made many attempts,
many appeals to find a solution to the crisis. The
response has been a continuous escalation of the brutal
use of force and the violation of all the human rights of
the people of that country.

Throughout this process we have engaged in
ongoing dialogue with the Arab countries. We always
took into account their guidance and requests to permit
and facilitate Arab League action before the Council
took a decision. This was done until their efforts were
no longer responded to, and they specifically
requested, last week, that this Council support their
political transition plan in order to achieve peace and
establish a democratic regime in Syria.

Colombia supported and voted in favour of the
draft resolution submitted by Morocco in response to
the request formally presented to the Council by the
Secretary-General of the League of Arab States (see S/PV.6710), convinced that the Syrian people must be
rescued from the terrible tragedy that they are suffering
today.
