The President (spoke in Arabic): As I said this
morning, in accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers
to limit their statements to no more than five minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate their texts in writing and
to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.

To optimize the use of our time in order to allow
as many delegations as possible to take the floor, I will
not individually invite speakers to take seats at the
Council table. When a speaker is taking the floor, the
Conference Officer will seat the next speaker on the
list at the Council table.

I call now on the representative of Japan.
