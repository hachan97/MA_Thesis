Mr. Abdounasir (spoke in French): At the outset,
I would like to thank all of the speakers for their kind
words about United Nations police.

Regarding the question on organized crime, I
would like to add that the United Nations Organization
Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (MONUSCO) police is working to support local
authorities in establishing mechanisms at the national
and provincial levels and to create synergies with
regard to cross-border crime. A lot has been achieved,
but I must say that much remains to be done, in light of
the fact that a vast swathe of the east of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, where armed groups operate,
maintains direct links to organized crime.

Turning to the question on the different Challenges
posed by the strategic review, I would like to raise three
points that we believe are crucial.

The first is the demilitarization of the response, in
the understanding that the protection of civilians across
much of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is an
issue more of security than of defence.

Our second challenge with regard to the strategic
review was to reconcile the population with State
institutions, because the people have lost confidence in
the State authorities. We were essentially tasked with
establishing community-basedjustice and with fighting
all forms of impunity and other root causes of the gap
between the population and State structures.

The third challenge posed by the strategic review
is the matter of restoring State authority across the
country's entire territory which, of course, involves the
police, the judiciary, the prison system and the territorial
administration. We believe that these are functions that
the United Nations police could very easily fulfil and
that is why we hope that the Council will recommend
increased functions for the MONUSCO police force so
that we can achieve these results.
