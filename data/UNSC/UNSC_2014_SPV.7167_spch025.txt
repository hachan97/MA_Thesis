Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I did not want to say that a lie cannot only be
a distortion of facts, but also a selective interpretation
of one's own position. That is what we have just heard
from my American colleague. What we have heard
from Washington, DC, and the way it was heard
clearly demonstrated to all - including to those in
Kyiv, which is most important - that the United States
looked favourably on the forceful change of power,

which did not ultimately serve the interests of the
Ukrainian people.

Regarding my proposal. 1 do think it would be good
to conclude this meeting with such a statement, not
asking every delegation what it is going to declare but
rather make ajoint statement calling for a swift halt to
all violence. including the use of military force in the
cast of the country, and for seriously taking up the full
implementation of the Geneva document.
