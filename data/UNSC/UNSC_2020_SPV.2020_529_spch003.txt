Allow me to begin by commending the Permanent Representative of France, Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere, for his leadership as the President of the Security Council during this month of June 2020. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Chair of the Security Council Committee pursuant to resolution 751 (1992) for his briefing. I am pleased by the Committee's commitment to the ideals of confidentiality and accountability. The Somali Government has taken great initial steps to re-establish relations with the Panel of Experts on Somalia, but in order to fully restore trust and confidence between the Panel of Experts and the Federal Government of Somalia, additional measures, including efforts aimed at resolving pending matters, are necessary. These pending matters include issues that we have already raised several times with the Chair and the sanctions committee. We are looking forward to a new proposed course of action to be undertaken by the Panel of Experts, as described in the November 2019 correspondence addressed to the Federal Government of Somalia.
