Ms. Wronecka (Poland): I thank you, Madam
President, for convening this meeting. I would also
like to thank Ambassador Karen Pierce for the detailed
update on the investigation into the attempted murder of
Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, which involved
a nerve agent. We greatly appreciate the transparency
of the United Kingdom in this process. We continue
to express our full solidarity with the British people
and the British Government, as well as our readiness
to support our close ally and European partner in
taking actions to respond to the shared threat posed by
chemical weapons.

Since the beginning, we have condemned that
unprecedented attack, which is the first of its kind in
Europe after the Second World War. We call on Russia
to fully cooperate with the British Government and the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
(OPCW).

The British investigation concluded that the
evidence available is sufficient to state that individuals
related to the Russian State are responsible for the
attack in Salisbury. Poland has full confidence in the
professionalism of the British police and investigating
authorities. We believe that the actions taken by the
United Kingdom constitute a significant step forward
towards ensuring that the use of chemical weapons will
not go unanswered.

Let me also reiterate that Poland continues to
commend the OPCW and its experts who participated in
the technical assistance visit for their outstanding work
to determine the facts on the ground in a professional
and impartial manner.
