Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I should like to
respond to the remarks made by the Ambassador of
Bolivia about the United Kingdom.

We have no doubt about the sovereignty of the
United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands, South
Georgia, South Sandwich Islands and surrounding
maritime areas. Successive British Governments have
made clear that sovereignty will not be transferred
against the wishes of the Falkland Islands. The
Falkland Islanders voted overwhelmingly to maintain
their current constitutional arrangements with the
United Kingdom.

Turning to the Chagos archipelago, the United
Kingdom is participating in the proceedings before the
International Court of Justice, even as we disagree with
jurisdiction in that case.
