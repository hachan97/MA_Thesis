Mr. Bessho (Japan): Japan supported and
co-sponsored the draft resolution submitted by the
United States (S/2017/962) because we believe that it
would have been the best way to keep the Organization
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United
Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) in
operation, while addressing various issues raised during
the discussion on improving the work of the JIM. at the

latest Council meeting on this item, on 7 November (see S/PV.8090).

Japan has repeatedly stated that we have confidence
in the expertise, impartiality and professionalism of the
JIM. Its work should continue until all perpetrators of
the use of chemical weapons have been identified.

It is deeply regrettable that the Security Council
has again failed to overcome its differences. There is
no change in the fact that the Council is ultimately
responsible for ensuring accountability for the use
of chemical weapons. I call on Council members not
to abandon our efforts to prevent the further use of
chemical weapons and not to allow impunity.
