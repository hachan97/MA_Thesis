Ms. Rice (United States of America): When
atrocities are committed against innocents, the
international community must speak with one voice
and today, it has. Tonight, acting under Chapter VII,
the Security Council has come together to condemn the
violence, pursue accountability and adopt biting
sanctions targeting Libya's unrepentant leadership.
This is a clear warning to the Libyan Government that
it must stop the killing. Those who slaughter civilians
will be held personally accountable. The international
community will not tolerate violence of any sort
against the Libyan people by their Government or
security forces.

Resolution 1970 (2011) is a strong resolution. It
includes a travel ban and an assets freeze for key
Libyan leaders. It imposes a complete arms embargo
on Libya. It takes new steps against the use of
mercenaries by the Libyan Government to attack its
own people. And, for the first time ever, the Security
Council has unanimously referred an egregious human
rights situation to the International Criminal Court.

As President Obama said today, when a leader's
only means of staying in power is to use mass violence
against its own people, he has lost the legitimacy to
rule and needs to do what is right for his country, by
leaving now.

The protests in Libya are being driven by the
people of Libya. This is about people's ability to shape
their own future, wherever they may be. It is about
human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Security
Council has acted today to support the Libyan people's
universal rights. These rights are not negotiable. They
cannot be denied. Libya's leaders will be held
accountable for violating these rights and for failing to
meet their most basic responsibilities to their people.
