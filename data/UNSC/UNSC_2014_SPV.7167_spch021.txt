Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Our encyclopedically educated and eloquent
French colleague inserted an interesting quotation in
his statement, to the effect that when we sin, it is only
the first step that carries a cost, and the subsequent
ones are easier. Indeed, we can find affirmations
of his words of wisdom in the history of the still
young twenty-first century. Among other things, the
twenty-first century has presented humankind and
international relations with the gift of practices such as
enforced regime change, done in an attempt to impose
someone's geopolitical vision on other countries of the
world. It is very clear that every such attempt launched
early in the twenty-first century has resulted in terrible
destabilization. But, having taken that first step, the
people who made those attempts have nonetheless been
unable to stop and have gone on with them. This time
that has led to serious destabilization in Ukraine.

I would like to remind the Council that, during the
several months of crises preceding the overthrow of
the lawful administration between 21 and 25 February,
our Western colleagues never once called for a halt to
the violence perpetrated in Kyiv and other regions of
Ukraine against the lawful authorities. There were no
calls to President Yanukovych to use every possible
means at his disposal as lawful President, including
that of force, in order to impose order in the country.
But now, for some reason, those calls are coming loud
and clear.

During this entire crisis, Russia has wanted only
one thing, which is to avoid destabilization in Ukraine
and settle everything through negotiations. We
proposed tripartite talks among Ukraine, the European
Union and Russia at the start ofthe crisis on the political
confrontation that focused on whether Ukraine should
sign an association agreement with the European Union.
For some reason, the European Union, with the support
of the United States, rejected our proposal. When the
25 February agreement was reached, we supported it.
We still believe that many of the 25 February positions
are right, and that they must be kept to if we hope to
bring Ukraine out of political crisis. We helped to
conclude the 17 April Geneva agreement. It is a simple
agreement, but it points to a way out of the crisis in
the country. The one thing that is essential is that the
agreement be fulfilled.

But the most striking and infuriating thing is
that the demands of the people of eastern Ukraine
are basically fairly simple. Finding themselves in a
situation in which the nation's capital was occupied by
an illegitimate authority, to a large degree consisting
of hostile nationalist radical elements, the people
asked that their rights be guaranteed. They demanded
federalization. It was noticeable that for a long
period - almost two months after the overthrow of the
lawful Government - no one there took up arms for at
least a couple of months. They were all waiting for some
constructive reaction from Kyiv to their demands for
protecting their own interests. Not once did any kind of
reasonable reaction or serious initiative emanate from
Kyiv. Today some of our colleagues spoke approvingly of
the most recent - today or yesterday - pronouncement
of Mr. Yatsenyuk, in which he talked about 25 May,
for which presidential elections are scheduled, and that
there will be some kind of poll on decentralization of
the country. A poll. The people have been fighting on
the barricades for weeks, and they think they have to
conduct a poll in order to figure out people's opinion
about what they want.

What bothered me more than anything today was
how calmly and approvingly our Western colleagues
spoke about the search operations that the Kyiv
authorities are now carrying out in eastern Ukraine.
They gave the impression that they know what the
Kyiv authorities are thinking, what their plans are.
Maybe they had a part in drawing up those plans, and
that was why they talked about what was going on so
calmly. Perhaps that should not be so surprising after
all, because, as we know, every visit to Kyiv by senior
American officials has resulted in events reaching
new levels of confrontation, and a more violent turn
of events. In that regard, it is not surprising that the
United States, as I said in my statement, did not want
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) to do as it was supposed to under the
Vienna Document, that is, to bring about dialogue and
organize a round table with representative of different
regions and the Kyiv Government. Why did the United
States not want the OSCE to do that?

Throughout the crisis, Russia several times has
suggested different formats for the organization of such
dialogue between the Government and opposition forces
and regions. The Government did not want to or could
not do it themselves. We suggested a constitutional
assembly be convened. They said they were not ready
to do so.

When the meeting of 17 April was organized, we
suggested that representatives of the regions should
be included, and that the four parties - the European
Union, the United States and Russia and the acting
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine - could start
those talks. But that proposal was rejected. The OSCE
was then given the mandate, which it tried to carry out
only then to be told it should not. Instead, tanks were
brought out to Sloviansk and other cities in the east of
the country.

Regarding what one colleague said, that Russia is
refusing to implement the 17 April Geneva statement,
I would repeat that Russia would never refuse to
implement any useful document agreed upon during
the crisis, including the 21 February agreement.
Actually listening to my statement today, one would
notice that the political components were quotations
from the 17 April document. If we are truly intent on
finding a political solution to the crisis in spite of the
dramatic events of recent days, then perhaps we might
ask the President, the Permanent Representative of
Korea, to make a statement following this meeting,
stating that the Security Council, in keeping with the
17 April Geneva statement, calls for a swift halt to the
violence, including, of course, the use of force in eastern
Ukraine, and appeals for the swift and comprehensive
implementation of the Geneva statement. If other
members would be ready to support such action, then
we would too.
