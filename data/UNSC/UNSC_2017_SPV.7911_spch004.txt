Mr. Kawamura (Japan): Japan welcomes the
unanimous adoption of resolution 2349 (2017) and
thanks the United Kingdom for its leadership. Japan is
pleased to have co-sponsored the resolution.
The resolution represents a milestone in the
Security Council's increased attention to the Lake
Chad basin. It also represents a test for us in terms
of taking a truly integrated approach to the region's
multidimensional challenges. The issues facing the
Lake Chad Basin, which range from terrorism and
trafficking to food insecurity and climate change,
cannot be solved individually.

The resolution reflects the fact that security
gains must be paired with support for development,
livelihoods, human rights and other efforts to address
the root causes of instability. We must build on this
foundation resolution on the Lake Chad basin by using
a variety of tools to achieve these aims, including
through the United Nations Office for West Africa
and the Sahel, the United Nations Regional Office
for Central Africa, the Peacebuilding Commission,
subregional and regional organizations, and bilateral
and multilateral support mechanisms.

Japan stresses the importance of implementing
this resolution, which clearly requires a comprehensive
approach. Japan looks forward to working with Council
members and many other actors to help sustain peace in
the Lake Chad basin.
