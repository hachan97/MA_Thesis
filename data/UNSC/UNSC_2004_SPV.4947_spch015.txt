Mr. Akram (Pakistan): We supported the draft
resolution (S/2004/3l3) presented by the United
Kingdom and the United States on the situation in
Cyprus since it expresses support for the Secretary-
General's plan for a comprehensive settlement in
Cyprus. We regret that the Security Council was not
able to adopt a unanimous position on the draft
resolution. Perhaps if there had been more time and
more consultations a consensus result would have been
possible. We hope nevertheless that the Greek Cypriots
and the Turkish Cypriots will read the right message
from the international community and take the historic
decision which they are called upon to take next
Saturday in their own best interests and in the interests
of their country and their region.
