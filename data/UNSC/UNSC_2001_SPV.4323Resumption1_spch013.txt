The President: I would now like to make a brief
statement in my national capacity.

I think that the discussion here today shows that
there is strong agreement among Council members, and
a consensus of views, about the situation in the region.
I know that message was sent by the mission under
Ambassador Levitte's leadership, which has been
widely complimented. Ijoin in complimenting him.

I hope that message is heard again today by the
countries in the region via our discussion. I do not want
to rehash the substance, or review the full agenda, of
what others have laid out. It is all there. I want to note
that the prominence that the Secretary-General attached
to the humanitarian situation in his remarks should
strike us all and encourage efforts to help deal with it.
This year, the United States intends to spend almost
$70 million on humanitarian assistance in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and we hope others
will join in that effort.

On the agenda before us, I think the task is clear
and that the message is that we need to get on with it
and, more importantly, that the parties need to get on
with it. I think the Council has always been very clear,
and my delegation is very clear, that the Security
Council will help if they help themselves and if they
take the responsibility that they need to exercise. All
must act, or all will continue to suffer. That is also very
clear.

The true success of the mission - which was a
success, I agree - will be in the follow-up and
performance that we see in the coming months. My
delegation looks forward to working with others
around the table to encourage that.

I now resume my functions as the President of the
Council.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 4.55 pm.
