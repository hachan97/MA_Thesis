The President: I thank the representative of Turkey
for his kind words addressed to me.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my list. I
would, however, like to thank non-members and members
of the Council alike for their vigorous and imaginative
participation in this debate. Your ideas and suggestions will
very usefully inform the deliberations of the newly
established working group that we have set up within the
Council. On behalf of the members of the Council, I am
grateful for such views.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 8 Il.m.
