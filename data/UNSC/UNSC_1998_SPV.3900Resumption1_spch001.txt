The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter dated 30 June 1998 from the
Permanent Representative of Qatar to the United Nations,
which reads as follows:

"I have the honour to request that the Security Council
extend an invitation under rule 39 of its provisional
rules of procedure to His Excellency Mr. Mokhtar
Lamani, Permanent Observer for the Organization of
the Islamic Conference to the United Nations, during
the Council's discussion on the item entitled "The
situation in the occupied Arab territories".

That letter will be published as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol 8/1998/592.

If I hear no objection, I shall take it that the Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 to Mr. Lamani,

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of the Syrian Arab Republic. I invite him to
take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
