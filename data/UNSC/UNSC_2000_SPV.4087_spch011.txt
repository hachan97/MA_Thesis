The President: I thank Dr. Piot for his inspired
leadership and his kind remarks concerning the comments
of our Vice-President.

We shall now begin the discussion by the members
of the Security Council. For those in the audience who do
not know the rules, members of the Security Council will
speak first. Then, because of the special nature of this
meeting, any other Member of the United Nations that
wishes to speak is invited to do so.

With a certain exception, I will ask the members of
the Security Council to follow the same rule that was
established so successfully last month by Ambassador
Greenstock during his presidency of the Security Council,

 

which was essentially a five-minute rule. Speakers should
also try to confine themselves to specific remarks. The
exception that I would like to make is, of course, for the
three Ministers of Health who have come here from such
a great distance to share with us their experiences.

I thank the Minister of Health of Namibia for joining
us today, and it is now my great honour to give her the
floor.
