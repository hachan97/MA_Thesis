Mr. Weisleder (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish):
My delegation is extremely concerned about the
serious events that have been taking place in Georgia
since yesterday. In particular we regret the harm caused
to innocent civilians. We call on all parties to halt
military action and declare a simultaneous, immediate
and permanent cessation of hostilities. We call upon
the parties to resume their contacts and their political
negotiations with a view to finding a settlement of their
dispute and of any conflict between them, without
preconditions. We reaffirm our support for the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia. We
urge the parties to facilitate the provision of
humanitarian assistance to all who have been affected,
wherever they may be on Georgian territory.
