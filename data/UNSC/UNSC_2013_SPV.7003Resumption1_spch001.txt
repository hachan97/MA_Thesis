The President: Under rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure, I invite the representative
of Uganda to participate in this meeting.

I wish to remind all speakers to limit their
statements to no more than four minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to circulate the text in writing and deliver a
condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Switzerland.
