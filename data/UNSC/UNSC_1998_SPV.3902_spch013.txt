Mr. Dangue Rewaka (Gabon) (interpretation from French): The efforts made by the Economic Community
of West African States, through its Monitoring Group
(ECOMOG), to re-establish constitutional legality and
restore peace in Sierra Leone deserve to be not only
welcomed, but also supported by the international
community. Indeed, these efforts have allowed the
democratically elected Government to undertake action,
in particular, to reorganize its administration and launch
national reconciliation.

The tangible and commendable contribution of the
Secretary-General, embodied in the dispatch of the United
Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone, will rightly
help to achieve the goals of peace and reconstruction in
Sierra Leone. The full achievement of these objectives
naturally includes monitoring the military and security
situation, disarmament, demobilization, and respect for
international humanitarian law.

For all these reasons, my delegation will vote in
favour of the draft resolution establishing UNOMSIL.
