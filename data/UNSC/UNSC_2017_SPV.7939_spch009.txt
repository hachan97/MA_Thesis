Mr. Clay (United Kingdom): The United Kingdom
welcomes the adoption of resolution 2352 (2017) today.
Through this text, we have extended the important
work of the United Nations Interim Security Force for
Abyei (UNISFA) for another six months.

I should like to pay tribute to the mission and to
Ethiopia for all they have done to improve the security
and humanitarian situation in Abyei, despite the absence
of political progress. Our collective priority now must
be supporting continued stability in the region and the
reinvigoration of the political process. UNISFA will
play an important role in that effort. But as it does, it is
right that we keep it under close review so that it is best
suited to fulfil its mandate.

Where there is evidence that part ofa mission is not
contributing to the implementation of a mandate, we
should not continue to devote resources to it, particularly
when budgets across all missions are under pressure.
For the past five years, the Joint Border Verification and
Monitoring Mechanism has been unable to monitor the
Safe Demilitarized Border Zone effectively because the
Governments of the Sudan and South Sudan have not
matched the commitment of UNISFA. The resolution
makes it clear that support to the Monitoring Mechanism
will stop in six months unless both Governments show
steadfast commitment to allowing the Mechanism to
reach full operational capability.

Therefore, let me close by urging the Governments
of the Sudan and South Sudan to fully engage
with the African Union and the Joint Political and
Security Mechanism, including by implementing the
commitments they made over the weekend, so that
governance and justice mechanisms can be established,
direct negotiations resumed and a final, overdue
settlements of the Abyei question can at last be agreed.
