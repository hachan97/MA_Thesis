Mr. Fedotov (Russian Federation) (interpretation from French): Our delegation is pleased to have this opportunity
to see you, Sir, presiding over this meeting of the Security
Council on the question of the Inter-African Mission to
Monitor the Implementation of the Bangui Agreement
(MISAB). This happy occasion is especially symbolic
Mr. Foreign Minister, since your country, and in particular
President Omar Bongo, have made and continue to make
such a crucial contribution to a political settlement in the
Central African Republic.

(spoke in Russian)

The Russian delegation will vote in favour of the draft
resolution to extend the authorization for MISAB until 16
March. We proceed from the premise that international
assistance in support of the Bangui Agreements is of great
significance for the stabilization of the situation in the
Central African Republic. We also note that although
progress has undeniably been made in restoring peace and
bringing about reconciliation in that country, it is not yet
irreversible.

Of great significance for further stabilization is the
commitment of all to the Bangui Agreements. It is
obvious that the difficult economic and social situation
remains a major destabilizing factor. In order to improve
that, we must undertake the efforts necessary for
economic and social recovery, which would be a sound
basis for normalization as a whole.

In principle, we are prepared to take a positive View
of the establishment in the Central African Republic of a
United Nations peacekeeping operation that is limited in
time and in resources. We are prepared to take a further,
more specific decision following an additional report from
the Secretary-General on the extension of the mandate
and the possible peacekeeping operation.
