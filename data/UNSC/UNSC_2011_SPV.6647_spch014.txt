Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of
the presidency of the Security Council for this month. I
also thank Ambassador ngu, Permanent
Representative of Nigeria, for her excellent conduct of
the work of the Council as President during the month
of October.

I have listened carefully to the briefing by
Mr. Moreno-Ocampo. Libya has now entered a new
historic stage. We hope that Libya will start an
inclusive process of political transition as soon as
possible, and that it will safeguard national unity and
integrity, take early steps to achieve social stability and
begin political and economic reconstruction. The
international community should continue its joint effort
in support of political transition and post-conflict
reconstruction in Libya.

China's position on issues concerning the
International Criminal Court remains unchanged.
