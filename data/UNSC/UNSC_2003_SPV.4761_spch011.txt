Mr. Wang Yingfan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
We welcome the presence of the Secretary-General at
today's meeting.

China has always supported and attached great
importance to the role of the United Nations on the
issue of Iraq and, even more, in the area of post-
conflict reconstruction. Such involvement will not only
contribute to long-term peace and stability in Iraq in
particular and the Gulf and the Middle East region in
general, but also contribute to maintaining the
credibility and authority of the United Nations.

The Chinese delegation, with a constructive
attitude, actively participated in the consultations on
the draft resolution that has been adopted as resolution
1483 (2003) and proposed a number of amendments.
We note that the sponsoring countries took into
consideration the views of other parties and revised the
original text. Some of China's specific concerns have
not been resolved satisfactorily, but in the light of the
Iraqi people's urgent need for reconstruction, China
voted in favour of the resolution. We hope that
resolution 1483 (2003) can be smoothly and effectively
implemented; that the Secretary-General can appoint a
Special Representative as soon as possible; and that the
United Nations can effectively play its due role in the
process of post-conflict reconstruction in Iraq.

As well, we hope that Iraq, a country that has
suffered tremendously from hardship and war, can
return to normalcy and rejoin the international
community as soon as possible.
