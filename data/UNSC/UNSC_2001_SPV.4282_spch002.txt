Mr. Eldon (United Kingdom): I have no trouble
with those amendments, but before we adopt this draft
resolution, I would like it to be absolutely clear among
all parties around this table that the basis for the
withdrawal from Pweto - which is the subject of
operative paragraph 4 of this draft resolution - the
substance of that agreement among the parties is the
lines that were agreed among the parties on 8 April last
year of a lS-kilometre withdrawal from the lines
originally held by the parties.

I would be most grateful if the Chairman of the
Political Committee could confirm to us very briefly
now that the substance of the agreement amongst the
parties for that first step of withdrawal in Katanga
province is founded on the agreement of 8 April last,
and on no other agreement since. If that is the case,
then members of the Council will understand that
further steps beyond that first withdrawal will need to
be agreed amongst the parties in the work that they
have to do subsequent to the adoption of this draft
resolution and, we hope, before 15 May.

I would be most grateful if the Chairman,
Mr. Mudenge, could confirm that position to us.
