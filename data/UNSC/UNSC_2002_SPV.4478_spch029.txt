The President (spoke in Spanish): I wish to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Saudi Arabia, in which he
requests to be invited to participate in the debate on the
item on the Council's agenda. Following the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council,
that the representative be invited to participate in the
debate, without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Shobokshi
(Saudi Arabia) took a seat at the side of the
Council Chamber.

The President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the
floor to the representative of Tunisia, whom I invite to
take a seat at the Council table and to make his
statement.
