The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by the Secretary-General, His Excellency
Mr. Ban Ki-moon. I would like to thank you,
Mr. Secretary-General, especially as you have come
here to meet with the Security Council when you have
just returned from a lengthy and difficult trip, which I
am sure has had its effects on you. I thank you very
much for your gesture towards the Council. I give you
the floor.
