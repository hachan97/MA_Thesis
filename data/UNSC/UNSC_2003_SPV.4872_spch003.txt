Mr. von Ungern-Sternberg (Germany): The
resolution just adopted establishes a follow-up
Committee to the Committee established pursuant to
resolution 661 (1990), which was terminated on 21
November, according to resolution 1483 (2003).
Germany has approved this resolution because we
attach great importance to continuity as regards the
implementation of sanctions resolutions adopted by the
Security Council.

We would like to thank the delegation of the
United Kingdom for having taken the initiative to
create this follow-up mechanism.

We agree that the identification of individuals and
entities pursuant to paragraph 19 of resolution 1483
(2003) is a task best carried out by a subsidiary organ
of the Security Council.

The arms embargo against Iraq has been
maintained pursuant to paragraph 10 of resolution 1483
(2003). Given the fact that the mandate of this follow-
up Committee does not cover the monitoring of
compliance with the arms embargo, it will be up to the
Council to supervise the arms embargo against Iraq.
For technical reasons but also for reasons of principle,
we would have preferred if the mandate of this new
sanctions committee had covered all remaining
sanctions, for example, including the arms embargo.
We therefore believe that it would be advisable to
review the mandate of the committee in due course, in
accordance with paragraph 3 of this resolution.
