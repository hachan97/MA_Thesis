Mr. Ipo (Cote d'Ivoire) (spoke in French): Cote
d'Ivoire decided to support the draft resolution
introduced by the co-penholders on humanitarian
issues in Syria (S/2019/756). We did so because, while
we firmly support the fight against terrorism, we are
nonetheless convinced that efforts in that regard must
take into full account norms established regarding
respect for international humanitarian, human rights
and refugee law.

In our consistent calls for dialogue to resolve the
Syrian conflict, Cote d'Ivoire also underscores that
military operations, wherever and under whatsoever
circumstances conducted, must respect international
law and human rights. International norms make it
incumbent on the parties to a conflict to apply the
principles of distinction and proportionality and oblige
them to take necessary measures to protect civilians
in conflict.

While my country commends the importance that
the two draft resolutions (S/2019/756 and S/2019/757)
give to the humanitarian situation in the country, which
has suffered a number of years of deadly conflict, it
nevertheless condemns the deeply differing approaches
that they support. Unfortunately, the Council is once
again deeply divided. Cote d'Ivoire regrets that neither
draft resolution found unity among the Council because
the parties did not exhaust the opportunities for dialogue
needed in such circumstances.

We therefore reiterate our call for further dialogue
among Member States, which is the only way to achieve
a consensus draft text that takes into account the
concerns of all the parties concerned.
