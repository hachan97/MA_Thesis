Mr. Heusgen (Germany): I do not want to prolong
the meeting. I would just like to respond to my Russian
colleague. Unfortunately, in his intervention he did
not respond to any of my comments on the serious
human rights violations. He mentioned that 22,000
demonstrators took to the streets in France, but not that
more than 3.3 million Venezuelans fled their country
because of the situation.
