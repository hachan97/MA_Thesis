Mr. Polyanskiy (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation voted in favour of resolution 2512 (2020), which extends the mandate of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS). We expect, in line with that document, the restructuring and withdrawal of the mission by 31 December to be carried out gradually and in a responsible manner. The resolution envisages that the United Nations country team, which will take over from UNIOGBIS in 2021, will have all the necessary tools to facilitate the socioeconomic development and normalization of political life in Guinea-Bissau, including the implementation of the relevant Government reforms provided for in the Conakry Agreement and the road map of the Economic Community of West African States. In view of the developments in Guinea-Bissau since the presidential elections, we call on all social and political forces to act responsibly in order to overcome their differences as soon as possible and create conditions conducive to easing the political tensions. The resolution stipulates that in six months, the Council will take concrete steps to review the Security Council sanctions against Guinea-Bissau. In that regard,we would like to emphasize that the restrictive measures imposed in 2012 have nothing to do with the current situation in the country. As was again demonstrated by the recent elections, the armed forces remain out of politics. Constitutional order was restored back in 2015. We can therefore state that the sanctions achieved their objective long ago. Maintaining the sanctions, in the light of the withdrawal of the United Nations presence in the country, is perplexing and could undermine the credibility of the Security Council.
