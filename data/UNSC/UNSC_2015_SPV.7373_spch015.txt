Mr. Omaish (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): At the
outset, I would like to thank your delegation, Sir, for its
successful leadership of the Security Council over the
past month. In that regard, we welcome the initiatives
of your presidency focusing on international peace and
security and peacebuilding.

I would like to recall in particular the open debate
held on inclusive development for the maintenance of
international peace and security (see S/PV.7361), which
was presided over by the President of the Republic of
Chile herself. The meeting reiterated the importance
of inclusive development to safeguarding international
peace and security, how complementary programmes
and policies promote the link between political,
security and development actions, and the importance
of upholding human rights and the rule of law.

National ownership is key to achieving lasting
peace. The open debate on post-conflict peacebuilding
(see S/PV.7359) was another opportunity to emphasize
the lasting effects of peacebuilding, the comprehensive
evaluation of the peacebuilding architecture, which will
be reviewed later this year, as well as the importance
of peacebuilding to consolidating political gains
and to building the capacity of States concerned to
complement international efforts. We look forward to
tomorrow's meeting on the protection of civilians and
the role of women in that regard.

I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the
delegation of China, which will assume the presidency
of the Council in February, with our full support.
