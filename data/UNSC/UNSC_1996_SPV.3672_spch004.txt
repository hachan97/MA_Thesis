Mr. Casardi (Italy): I too wish to express our
satisfaction, Sir, at seeing you as President of the Security
Council for the month of June, and also to convey our
gratitude and esteem to the representative of China, who
served as President last month.

I wish to express the strong concern of my delegation
over the incidents and events that have taken place in Iraq
over the past two days. The flat refusal by the Iraqi
authorities to allow an inspection team of the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) access to two
sites designated for inspection constitutes a clear violation
of the relevant resolutions. In the past there have been
various cases in which the Iraqi authorities delayed
UNSCOM's access to inspection sites, but this is the first
time that UNSCOM. teams have been categorically denied
access to designated inspection sites by the Iraqi
authorities - and, as members know, twice in two days.

Therefore, the Council must respond promptly to this
behaviour by the Baghdad Government and affirm the
unacceptability of any attempt by Iraq to deny access to any
site that the Special Commission wishes to inspect.

That is why Italy will vote in favour of this draft
resolution. The draft resolution will send the strong
message to Baghdad that it must cooperate fully with the
Special Commission in accordance with all relevant
resolutions. The language is balanced and reiterates the
commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity of Iraq.

Finally, I wish to express Italy's full support for the
efforts of Ambassador Ekeus and the Special Commission
in fulfilment of their mandate. I also stress our hope that
the Iraqi Government will desist from relying on behaviour
that is contrary to the resolutions of the Council and whose
only effect is to delay the lifting of sanctions.
