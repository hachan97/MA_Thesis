The President (spoke in Spanish): It is true that
time is short, because there are many delegations that
want to take the floor, but I would like to point out that
six member delegations have limited their speaking
time and that one member spoke on behalf of six.
Therefore, we are applying the same rules to Council
members.

I now give the floor to the representative of Saudi
Arabia.
