Ms. Kpongo (Central African Republic) (spoke in French): | must apologize in advance because I am losing my voice at this very important time and, as such, will be forced to be brief. My delegation welcomes the adoption of resolution 2507 (2020), renewing the sanctions regime concerning the Central African Republic, even if the unanimity that we had hoped for was not achieved. I sincerely thank all members of the Security Council. We are especially pleased by the spirit of consensus and compromise that prevailed during the negotiations, given the fact that the fate of an entire people depends on the decisions that the Council takes in this Chamber. I sincerely commend France, the penholder, for its flexibility throughout these days of consultations, which yielded a concise text acceptable to all. My delegation welcomes the further easing of the arms embargo with respect to certain types of vehicles. The activities of armed groups in the north of the country, specifically in Vakaga prefecture, remain a source of deep concern for the population, even if the latest events in Bria led to casualties in the ranks of those groups themselves. Equipping the defence and security forces with vehicles will ensure their mobility in areas affected by insecurity and their rapid intervention to protect civilians in distress. Indeed, it is those criminal activities throughout the country that have led the Government to call for the complete lifting of the arms embargo. I would be remiss in concluding without congratulating Viet Nam for its excellent work over the course of its presidency in the month of January, even though it is the last day of that presidency. I wish the new elected members of the Council every success in discharging their mandate over the next years.
