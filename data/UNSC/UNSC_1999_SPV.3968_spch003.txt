The President (interpretation from Spanish): I
should like to thank Mr. Vieira de Mello for his inspiring
and detailed briefing. I am sure that his statement
contained many ideas that will be the subject of reflection
and comment. I believe it would also be useful for the
members of the Council to receive the notes that Mr.
Vieira de Mello had prepared, because I believe that we
must think deeply about this matter, beyond what is said
today.
