The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Afghanistan, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Ayoob
(Afghanistan) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/708, which contains the text of a
letter dated 14 November 2008 from the President of
the Security Council addressed to the Secretary-
General.

At this meeting, the Council will hear a briefing
by Mr. Giulio Terzi di Sant'Agata, head of the Security
Council mission to Afghanistan and Permanent
Representative of Italy.

I would like to welcome the return of the
members of the Council and the Secretariat who took
part in the mission to Afghanistan.

I now give the floor to Mr. Giulio Terzi di
Sant'Agata, head of the Security Council mission to
Afghanistan.
