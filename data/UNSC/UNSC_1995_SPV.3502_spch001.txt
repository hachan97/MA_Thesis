The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 5 of
Security Council resolution 955 (1994), document
S/ 1995/ 134.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/l995/148, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless
I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the
vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council who
wish to make statements before the voting.
