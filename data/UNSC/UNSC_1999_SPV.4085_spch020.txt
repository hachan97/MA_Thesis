The President: I think it would be right on behalf of
the whole Council to thank the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations for its hard work on East Timor as part of the
very considerable burden it is undertaking at the moment.
I would also ask the Assistant Secretary-General please to
convey to the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General in East Timor, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello
, and to his team our warm appreciation for what they have
achieved thus far in the interim administration.

There are no further speakers on my list. The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its

consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 1.10 17.171.
