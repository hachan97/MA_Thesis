Mr. Ruiz Massieu: I have essentially said what
I needed to say. There were no questions directed at
me. Again, I appreciate the opportunity to address
the Council, and I thank Council members for the
comments directed at the Mission's work. We are at the
disposal of the Council for any further clarification in
the future.
