Ms. Citaku: Kosovo is a free, sovereign and
independent country; that will never change. The
sooner the representative of Serbia realizes that, the
better it will be for him and the better it will be for
Serbia. We urge him to accept reality. We call on him
to accept the facts. We call on him to read the opinion
of the International Court of Justice. After all, it was
Serbia that asked for that opinion.
We call on him not to try to change or twist
historical facts. The war in Kosovo happened in the
twenty-first century, before the eyes of the Council and
those of the world. No court, no process, no fabricated
facts can rewrite history. We have always cooperated
with international justice. We have nothing to hide, and
we are looking forward to cooperating in future. The
agreement with the Netherlands is in the pipeline; we
want that court to be established as soon as possible.

Again, we will never ask for Serbia's permission to
exercise our right,just because we did not quite succeed
and were short three votes on one occasion. Iassure you
that next time we will succeed.

About my status here, 1 am the Ambassador of the
Republic of Kosovo to the United States of America.
The Head of our Mission in New York will be arriving
soon; she is also a woman. We know that we are not

yet a United Nations Member. Just because we are not
treated as such does not mean that we will not act as
such.

I apologize for having taken additional time.

The meeting rose at 5.15 pm.
