Mr. Salam (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): Lebanon
regrets the fact that some speakers have tried to use
today's debate to distract us from our main work,
which is to consider the work of the technical
committees involved in the fight against terrorism. We
therefore reject the conflation of the legitimate right of
people to resist foreign occupation with terrorism.
Worse still, the party that did so was the one that not
only occupies other people's territories, but also
attacks its neighbours and defies this Council's
resolutions and the provisions of international law. We
therefore see an absolute need to agree unanimously on
a definition of terrorism, which my delegation has long
called for.
