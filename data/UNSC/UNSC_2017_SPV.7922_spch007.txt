Mr. Aboulatta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Egypt
supported the draft resolution (S/20l7/3lS) submitted
by the United Kingdom, France and the United States
owing to our interest in the Security Council carrying
out its responsibilities with regard to the crimes
committed against the Syrian people, particularly
given the fact that our Syrian brethren have suffered
chemical attacks more than once. I reiterate that we
cannot accept any impunity for such crimes.

We have supported, and will continue to support,
the principle of accountability for everyone proven
to have perpetrated such inhuman acts, regardless of
motivation. The Council must undertake all agreed
procedures aimed at determining the truth on the basis
of evidence and implement the relevant resolutions.
Accordingly, we express our extreme dismay at the fact
that we were not able to adopt the draft resolution and
thus have failed to send a message on the imperative of
determining what really happened in Khan Shaykhoun.

However, I would also like to reiterate that the
failure to adopt the draft must not affect in any way the
objectives of the inquiry mission, on the basis of the
clear mandates contained in Council resolutions. Here I
call on all international, regional and Syrian parties to
cooperate fully with both international mechanisms, in
keeping with resolutions 2235 (2015) and 2298 (2016),
in order to achieve justice. This is the least we can do
for the Syrian people in the context of an issue that has
deeply polarized the Council.
