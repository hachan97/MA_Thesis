The Russian Federation voted in favour of resolution 2541 (2020), on the situation in Mali. We are concerned at the recent events in Mali and consider the sanctions regime as a relevant tool to promote peace and security in that country. At the same time, it is regrettable that our proposal to extend the mandate of the Panel of Experts with the task to provide the Committee with information on the potential delisting was not taken on board. Sanctions are not an end in and of themselves. We should create incentives to change the behaviour of those who are on the sanctions list. A delisting perspective could be one of them. The sanctions committee should regularly receive updated and independent information from the Panel of Experts on the activities of designated individuals and entities. If they cease engaging in the prohibited activities, the Panel should have a clear mandate to propose delisting. In general, the present delisting mechanisms in the country-specific sanctions regimes are extremely ineffective, and therefore cannot be used as an active instrument of the overall sanctions strategy. It is our priority, in cooperation with the members of the Security Council, to seek improvements to this unsatisfactory situation.
