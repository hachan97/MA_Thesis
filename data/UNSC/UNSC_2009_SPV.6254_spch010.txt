Mr. Apakan (Turkey): Having voted in favour of
resolution 1907 (2009), I would like to make the
following brief statement. Turkey believes in principle
that disputes should be solved through diplomacy and
dialogue. In that regard, I join others in hoping that
today's resolution is utilized by all parties concerned as
an opportunity to resolve all outstanding issues in the
Horn ofAfrica.
