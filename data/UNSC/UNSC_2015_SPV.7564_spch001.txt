The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document 8/2015/846, which contains the text of
a letter dated 5 November 2015 from the Permanent
Representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland to the United Nations, addressed
to the Secretary-General, transmitting a concept note
on the item under consideration.

I very warmly welcome His Excellency Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon, to whom I now give the floor.
