Ms. Rice (United States of America): The United
States will support the draft resolution that is before us,
but we would like to highlight an important point. The
aviation assets on loan to the United Nations Operation
in Cote d'Ivoire (UNOCI) will be returned to the
United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) no later
than 30 June, pursuant to the draft resolution, in order
to avoid destabilizing Liberia. We applaud the efforts
of UNMIL's peacekeepers to continue to fulfil their
duties, despite having fewer assets - a sacrifice they
generously made, and which we all deemed necessary,
to assist UNOCI in a time of need.

Now, as Cote d'Ivoire begins to emerge from its
crisis, we must not lose focus on Liberia. As Liberia
enters its electoral season, with a referendum in August
and a presidential election this fall, UNMIL must be
fully equipped. We, as a Council, decided that UNMIL
2
required specific assets to fulfil its mandate, and we
must honour our commitment to ensuring that it has the
tools on hand to do its job.

The United States has promised to support clear,
credible and achievable mandates that are fully
resourced and equipped. We must not jeopardize
Liberia's fragile peace even as we continue to work to
consolidate the progress that we have seen of late in
C6te d'Ivoire. This will be the last extension of the
loan of UNMIL's assets that the United States will
support, barring any unforeseen circumstances.
