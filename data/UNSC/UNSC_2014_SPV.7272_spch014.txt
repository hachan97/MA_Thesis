President Kagame: I would like to thank you,
President Obama, for calling and presiding over this
very important meeting.

For decades terrorism has been, and continues to
be, a reality in Africa and across the world. In some
regions, it has even been getting worse. Another
reality is that we can and must defeat those violent
extremists and terrorists through concrete actions and
cooperation. This week we commemorated the attack
on the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, which claimed dozens
of lives.

Resolution 2178 (2014), which we have just adopted,
is therefore an unfortunate necessity. Additional
measures to disrupt terrorist travel and financing
are important, and we will continue to do our part.
Above and beyond that, wherever atrocities are being
committed, the first priority is to halt them. Only then
can efforts to address the root causes be effective.
Terrorism is not caused by religion, ethnicity or even
poverty, but by misguided politics and false beliefs. In
order to build resilience to extremist narratives, people,
especially youth, must feel that they have a stake in
their country. We therefore fully endorse the call for a
broad-based approach to combating violent extremism.

In Rwanda, we still face acts of terrorism driven
by the ideology of genocide. When necessary, we
have responded with force, but more importantly, we
have remained committed to building inclusive and
accountable institutions and systems. In particular, it
is essential that those who renounce violence can be
accommodated. The Rwandan demobilization and
reintegration programme, carried out in partnership
with the United Nations and the World Bank, has
provided tens of thousands with a pathway out of
extremism.

Resolution 2178 (2014) reflects a consensus that
terrorism is an urgent problem for the entire world.
We stand ready to work together to make sure that we
address that challenge with others.
