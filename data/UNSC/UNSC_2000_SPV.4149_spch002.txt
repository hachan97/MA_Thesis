Mr. Andjaba (Namibia): Let me first and
foremost thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,
and his Personal Envoy, Mr. Baker, for the work they
are doing to resolve the question of Western Sahara.

Nevertheless, the last two reports of the
Secretary-General on Western Sahara - S/2000/l3l of
17 February 2000 and S/2000/46l of 22 May 2000 -
contain some observations with which my delegation
does not agree.

My delegation wishes to reiterate that the United
Nations settlement plan remains the only viable
mechanism by which to achieve a lasting solution to
the question of Western Sahara. The United Nations
plan will enable the people of Western Sahara to
exercise their inalienable rights to self-determination
and independence in accordance with General
Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960
and 40/50 of 2 December 1985, and with resolution
AHG/Res.104 (XIX), adopted by the Assembly of
Heads of State or Government of the Organization of

African Unity at its nineteenth ordinary session, held at
Addis Ababa from 6 to 12 June 1983.

Namibia fully supports the recommendation of
the Secretary-General to extend the mandate of the
United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara (MINURSO) until July 2000, notwithstanding
some observations in the Secretary-General's report
that have serious political implications and that cause
concern to my delegation. My delegation cannot
endorse observations which seek to diverge from the
implementation of the United Nations settlement plan.
It is for that reason that my delegation will not support
the draft resolution before us.
