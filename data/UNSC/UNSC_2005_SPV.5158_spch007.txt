Mr. Oshima (Japan): My delegation voted in
favour of the draft resolution proposed by the United
Kingdom because impunity for serious violations of
human rights and crimes against humanity committed
in Darfur must not be allowed, and because, in order to
bring the perpetrators to justice, Japan supports, in
principle, the referral of the case of Darfur to the
International Criminal Court (ICC) within the
appropriate time frame, although Japan is not a party to
the Rome Statute. We wish to record our position,
however, that we would have much preferred a Council
decision on this matter to have been taken with broader
agreement.

Nonetheless, we welcome the fact that, in a spirit
of compromise and flexibility, a decision has been
taken to address the important issue of impunity. Now
that this resolution has been adopted, my Government
expects the parties concerned to abide by it and to
cooperate in its implementation to bring those
responsible to justice.
