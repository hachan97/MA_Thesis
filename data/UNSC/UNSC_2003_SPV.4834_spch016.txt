Mr. Atieh (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): My delegation thanks Mr. Kalomoh, Assistant
Secretary-General for Political Affairs, for his detailed
briefing on the latest developments in Guinea-Bissau.
We also welcome the Foreign Minister of Timor-Leste,
Special Envoy of the Community of Portuguese-
Speaking Countries. We thank him for his detailed
briefing.

The situation in Guinea-Bissau is undoubtedly
very difficult indeed - politically, economically and
socially, following the coup d'e'tat in that country. We
believe that the crisis must be dealt with before it turns
into a catastrophe whose consequences cannot be
contained. We look forward to quick settlement of
current political differences in Guinea-Bissau, and we
also look forward to a return to constitutional order and
to the holding of elections, we hope, in the next few
months.

My delegation supports the role of the United
Nations Peace-Building Support Office in Guinea-
Bissau as well as the important role being undertaken
by the African Union and the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) to assist in the
stabilization of the situation in Guinea-Bissau.

We support other delegations that have called on
the international community to provide emergency
economic assistance to Guinea-Bissau in order to
enable the country to overcome this difficult
transitional period and to prevent further economic and
social chaos.
