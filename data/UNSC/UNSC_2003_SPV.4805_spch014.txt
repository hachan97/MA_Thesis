Mr. Cunningham (United States of America):
We share many of the sentiments expressed by other
speakers so far around the table, and I think that there
is a clear message of Council support to which I want
to add. We similarly thank Ambassador Sinclair for his
briefing and, more importantly, for his effective efforts
to promote lasting peace and to complete the mandate
of the United Nations Political Office in Bougainville
(UNPOB). I wish also to thank our colleague the
Ambassador of Papua New Guinea for his informative
contribution to the discussion this morning.

We are encouraged by the progress that is
obviously being made, as is apparent in both
presentations, and we very much welcome the fact that
the completion of stage II of the weapons disposal
process has been verified. We support moving forward
with stage III expeditiously and, hopefully, with the
participation of all concerned. It is important to move
forward.

We also particularly want to commend Australia
and New Zealand, as well as Fiji and Vanuatu, for
having taken such a positive initiative in supporting the
peace process in Bougainville with the creation of the
Bougainville Transition Team. This is an important
element of regional support for the parties and, indeed,
for the international community and the United Nations
as a whole.

With less than six months left before UNPOB's
mandate expires, we know that the United Nations and
UNPOB will be working hard to ensure completion of
the remaining tasks by December 2003, helping to
create the basis for the establishment of Bougainville's
autonomy. UNPOB and the parties will have our
support and encouragement.
