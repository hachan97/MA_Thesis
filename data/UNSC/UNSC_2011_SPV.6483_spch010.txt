Mr. Li Baodong (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
would like to thank Special Representative of the
Secretary-General Zannier for his briefing. I also
welcome the presence among us today of Mr. Vuk
Jeremie, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia. I have
listened very carefully to his statement, as well as that
by Mrs. Vlora Citaku.

Currently, the overall situation in Kosovo is calm.
However, it remains complex and fragile. We are
concerned about the inter-communal tensions that exist
in Kosovo.

China respects the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Serbia. We have always been of the opinion
that the question of Kosovo touches on peace and
stability in the Balkans, and in fact in the whole of
Europe. It is therefore up to the parties concerned,
within the framework of the pertinent resolutions of the
Security Council, to find a negotiated solution that is
acceptable to both parties. China encourages the
beginning of dialogue between the various parties with
a view to finding an appropriate solution to the
outstanding issues.

Resolution 1244 (1999) remains valid and
continues to be an important legal instrument to
resolve the issue of Kosovo. China supports the
continued work of the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo in line with the
mandate conferred upon it by the Security Council. We
call for a greater role for it in solving the problems in
Kosovo. All parties concerned must ensure the security
of UNMIK staff and facilitate their work under optimal
conditions.

China is extremely concerned about the illicit
trafficking in human organs in Kosovo, as indicated in
the report of the Secretary-General (S/2011/43). Any
violations of international law and international
humanitarian law are intolerable. China understands
the reasonable concerns of Serbia and supports the
opening of a United Nations inquiry into this matter.
