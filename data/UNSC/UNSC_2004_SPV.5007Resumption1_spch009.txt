The President: The Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) has indeed been
actively involved for several years in addressing many
conflicts in West Africa, both internal and regional. We
hope that ECOWAS will continue to cooperate in the
same determined way with different United Nations
peacekeeping and stabilization missions deployed in
that region.
