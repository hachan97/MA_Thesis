Mr. Mangaral (Chad) (spoke in French): I thank
the Chair of the Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1737 (2006), Ambassador Gary Quinlan,
for his quarterly report on the activities of the
Committee. I welcome his emphasis on strengthening
communications between the Committee and Member
States and international organizations with regard to
the implementation of the provisions of resolutions and
the importance he attaches to contacts with Member
States. Indeed, it was such communication that allowed
Member States to receive reports on the measures taken
by national structures or thanks to assistance from the
Panel of Experts of the Committee, as contained in the
Committee's annual report.

My country congratulates the Committee on its
adoption of its biannual plan of work and takes note of
the six recommendations of its Panel of Experts.

In conclusion, I note that, in the light of the
launching of a Shahab-3 missile by Iran, in violation
of paragraph 9 of resolution 1929 (2010), according to
the Panel of Experts, and the interception of an arms
shipment in Yemen, which the Committee characterized
as a probable violation by Iran of paragraph 5 of
resolution 1747 (2007), the Committee should continue
to communicate with Iran seeking responses to its
concerns. Likewise, the ongoing talks between the P5+l
and Iran, following the Geneva joint plan of action of
24 November 2013, must continue and produce positive
results.
