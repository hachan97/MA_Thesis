Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
Chinese delegation voted in favour of resolution 2182
(2014), which was just adopted by the Security Council.
At the same time, I wish to emphasize two points.

First, China always maintains that, in its
consultations on relevant resolutions, the Security
Council must extensively listen to the views of all sides
and effectively respect the legitimate demands of States
and regional organizations concerned.Arab States had
concerns on parts of the text of the draft resolution. In
its prior consultations on the draft, the Security Council
should have heeded those concerns and, through full
consultations, tried to reach maximum consensus and
garner the widest support.

Secondly, resolution 2182 (2014) clearly stipulates
that the resolution shall not be regarded as establishing
customary international law. Measures taken by States
under the resolution should not affect flag States'
exclusive jurisdiction over their vessels on the high
seas. Any inspection of such vessels needs the prior
consent of the flag States concerned.

China maintains that resolution 2182 (2014) should
be implemented fully and to the letter. In implementing
the resolution, Member States should adhere to the
principles of international law and effectively protect
the legitimate rights and interests of the flag States and
countries concerned.
