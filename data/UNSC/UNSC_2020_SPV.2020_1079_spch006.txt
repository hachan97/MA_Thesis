I would first like to thank Ambassador Kridelka, his predecessor and our colleagues from Belgium for their work chairing the Committee pursuant to resolution 751 (1992), concerning Somalia, especially as we operate in these challenging times. I would also like to thank the Panel of Experts on Somalia for their work this year and their high-quality reporting. That reporting notes the progress made by the Federal Government of Somalia in areas such as weapons and ammunition management and controlling the export of charcoal. I congratulate Somalia on that, and I urge the country to continue moving forward. The reporting also clearly highlights the scale of the challenge that Somalia faces in combating Al-Shabaab and the need for the international community to support Somalia in that endeavour. I wish to make three points. That will require a multifaceted approach, and our work in the Committee and through the sanctions mandate is a vital part of that. We need to support Somalia and work together - the Federal Government of Somalia, the international community and the private sector - to combat Al-Shabaab and, as highlighted in the report (see S/2020/949), reduce its ability to raise financing. Finally, Somalia sadly continues to face serious humanitarian challenges. I would therefore like to reiterate the point made by Ambassador Kridelka regarding the importance of the humanitarian exemption in the sanctions resolution.
