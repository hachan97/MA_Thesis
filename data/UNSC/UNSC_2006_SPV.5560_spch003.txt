Mr. Lacroix (France) (spoke in French): France
voted in favour of the additional extension for six
months of the mandate of the United Nations Mission
for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO).
The United Nations Secretary-General has underscored
the vital role of the presence of MINURSO for the
continued ceasefire in Western Sahara.

France would once again state its wish that the
next few months should be used profitably to break the
impasse. No one can be happy about this impasse, and
there is a need to establish a mutually acceptable
06-59410
political agreement within the United Nations
framework.

France has noted with interest the intention of the
Kingdom of Morocco, noted in the report of the
Secretary-General, to present some proposals over the
next few months. This is an encouraging development
that, we hope, will make it possible to move forward.

France, once again, would reaffirm its support for
the activities of the Secretary-General and the work of
his Personal Envoy.
