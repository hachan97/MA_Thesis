Mrs. DiCarlo (United States of America): The
United States welcomes the renewal of the Iran Panel
of Experts' mandate today. United Nations sanctions
panels are a well-established independent tool for
improving the implementation of United Nations
sanctions. They play a critical role in enhancing the
credibility of Security Council resolutions. The Iran
Panel is further evidence of this and deserves our full
support. The Panel has conducted excellent
investigative work. We welcome the Panel's
professionalism and high standards.

The latest report of the Director General of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
11-36884
underscores Iran's continued failure to comply with its
international nuclear obligations and its sustained lack
of full cooperation with the IAEA. It further
demonstrates that Iran has not taken any meaningful
steps required of it by this Council or called for by the
IAEA Board of Governors.

In the light of Iran's ongoing non-compliance,
most notably Iran's expanded uranium enrichment, it is
imperative that the international community strengthen
the enforcement of these sanctions. The Panel of
Experts offers the Council and its Iran Sanction's
Committee seasoned advice on how to do that. The full
implementation of the provisions contained in the
Council's resolutions will send a powerful signal to
Iran's decision makers, as well as constrain Iran's
ability to continue its proliferation-sensitive activities.

Today's vote, combined with the joint statement
issued today by China, France, Germany, the Russian
Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States
at the IAEA Board of Governors meeting in Vienna,
serves to reinforce the unity shared among these
countries to resolve our shared concerns about Iran's
nuclear programme.
