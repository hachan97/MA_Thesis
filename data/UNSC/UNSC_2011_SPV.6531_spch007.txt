The President (spoke in French): I thank
Mr. Simonovic' for his briefing.
Given the large number of representatives who
wish to take the floor, I would urge all speakers to

speak succinctly and to circulate the full versions of
their statements. I would like to remind all speakers
that brevity and clarity often go hand in hand.

I now give the floor to the members of the
Council.
