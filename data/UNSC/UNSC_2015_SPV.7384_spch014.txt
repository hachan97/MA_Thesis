Mr. Hmoud (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): Jordan
voted in support of resolution 2202 (2015) because
we believe that a political solution is the right way to

achieve peace and security and to help Ukraine regain
stability. We call on the parties to fully implement
the provisions of the September Minsk agreement in
accordance with the specified time frame. The Minsk
agreement is the main reference point upon which all
successive agreements are based. Furthermore, we
believe that the package of measures does not in any
way alter the provisions of the Minsk agreement.

We call upon all parties to observe the agreements
and to implement the measures set out therein. We also
call upon them to take the necessary measures to declare
a ceasefire and to withdraw heavy weaponry. In that
connection, we would like to express our concern about
the failure over the last two days to respect the ceasefire
in Debaltseve. We also call on the secessionists to put
an end to violations of the agreements.

In conclusion, we call on the parties concerned
to show the seriousness required to reach a peaceful
political solution that allows Ukraine to regain its
territorial integrity and independence.
