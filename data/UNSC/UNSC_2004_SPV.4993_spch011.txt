The President: I thank the representative of
Angola for his expression of support for our initiative,
as well as his valuable comments on our concept paper
on the role of civil society. He also cited the new
partnership that is emerging between and among
various stakeholders in national reconciliation and
peace-building, especially as they relate to Africa.
