Mr. Denisov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I should like to welcome President Obasanjo
to the Security Council. We are pleased at the
opportunity to learn first-hand about the assessment of
the African Union (AU) with regard to developments
in the Sudan, particularly those in Darfur.

Russia has consistently supported the
peacekeeping efforts of the AU and the personal efforts
of President Obasanjo to facilitate a swift settlement of
the Darfur crisis. We are sure that peace in the Sudan
can be achieved only by political means, through more
active use of the AU's potential and through the
development of cooperation between the AU and the
United Nations. Of course, all the Sudanese parties
must comply in good faith with their respective
obligations.

My colleagues and the ministers present here
today who have already spoken have answered the
questions we had wanted to ask of President Obasanjo,
particularly concerning what the Security Council
could do in addition to providing political support for
the AU's efforts in Darfur and what could be done to
provide for parallel progress in the Abuja and Naivasha
negotiating processes.
