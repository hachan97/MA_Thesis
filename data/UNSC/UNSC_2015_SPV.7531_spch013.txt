Mrs. ngu (Nigeria): Nigeria welcomes the
adoption of resolution 2240 (2015), which seeks to
address the menace of migrant smuggling and human
trafficking in the Mediterranean, which has developed
into a grave humanitarian crisis. As a State party to
the United Nations Convention against Transnational
Organized Crime and its Protocols, Nigeria supports
legitimate measures to combat the trafficking in
persons.

The activities of the migrant smugglers and human
traffickers operating in the Mediterranean continue
to endanger human lives. Thousands of men, women
and children, as we have heard, have perished at sea
in their attempt to seek safety and refuge beyond their
borders. Nigeria condemns in the strongest terms the
utter disregard for human life demonstrated by the
smugglers and traffickers. In the same vein, we condemn
the maltreatment of migrants both in transit and in
destination States. That is a violation of international
humanitarian law and international refugee law. We
urge all States to ensure the humane and dignified
treatment of all migrants.

It is beyond any doubt that fighting transnational
organized crime requires international cooperation.
An important dimension of that cooperation is sharing
intelligence. That is pivotal to thwarting the criminal
smuggling and trafficking networks. Origin, transit and
destination States must collaborate on this and other
measures. Indeed, all hands must be on deck.
The adoption of the resolution sends a strong,
unequivocal message to the smuggling and trafficking
networks that the die is cast. Human trafficking will
no longer be the pattern for profits. If the resolution
is implemented conscientiously we hope that it will
ultimately serve as a model for other regions of the
world.
