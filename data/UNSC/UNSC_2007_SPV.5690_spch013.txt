Mr. Bartho (Slovakia): I would like to express
my delegation's appreciation to Justice George Gelaga
King, President of the Special Court for Sierra Leone,
and to the Prosecutor, Stephen Rapp, for their briefings
to the Security Council.

My delegation aligns itself with the statement
that will be delivered by the representative of Germany
on behalf of the European Union. We do not wish to
repeat the same points, so I would like to highlight
only a few issues.

We welcome the commencement of the trial of
Charles Taylor. Although Taylor's trial is taking place
at the International Criminal Court, in The Hague, it is
and will remain a trial conducted by the Special Court
for Sierra Leone. It is necessary to emphasize this and
to keep explaining it constantly to the public, in
particular in Sierra Leone and Liberia.

In this context, Slovakia welcomes and supports
measures aimed at ensuring that proceedings are
accessible to West Africans, including facilitating the
attendance of journalists and civil society
representatives from Liberia and Sierra Leone,
preparing video and audio summaries of Taylor's trial
for dissemination throughout Sierra Leone, and making
broadcasts of Taylor's trial available at the Court's
premises in Freetown.

The second issue I want to mention is the
outreach programme of the Sierra Leone Court. The
innovative work of the Court's Outreach Section,
which continues to bring the Court's activities and
accomplishments to every town and village in Sierra
Leone, to schools and colleges in the country and to the
people of the subregion, deserves high
acknowledgement and can set a good example for the
work of other tribunals.

Finally, I would like to underline our full support
for the Court and also for the successful completion of
its work.
