Mr. Al-Kidwa (Palestine) (spoke in Arabic):
Very briefly, I wish to make one additional comment to
be included in the records of our meeting.

We convey our official condolences to the
Governments of Turkey and Switzerland on the deaths
of two members of the Temporary International
Presence in Hebron. Our condolences also go out to the
families and colleagues of the victims. We greatly
appreciate the efforts and work of all personnel of that
group and we strongly condemn the killing of two of
its members, which we firmly believe to have been
committed by the Israeli army. However, the
Palestinian Authority has openly declared its
acceptance of an international investigation into this
event and reiterates that position before the Council.

Once again, we extend our condolences on the
deaths of the two members and of all innocent
foreigners who have lost their lives, including the
Italian journalist killed a few days ago.
