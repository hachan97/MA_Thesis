Mr. Arias (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): At the
outset, I should like to welcome the presence of the
Secretary-General, who is with us today. I recognize
his leadership and his commitment to human rights in
the Darfur region.

The action taken today by the Security Council is
undoubtedly reason for this collegial body to be
proud - as should the entire United Nations, of which
the Council is a part. It is also a source of pride for the
international community, which has been so concerned
by this issue. But first and foremost, it should be a
source of pride for the Government and the people of
the Sudan.

But we must be clear that what we have done
today in this Chamber is only the beginning of a
process, the true culmination or success of which will
lie in the pacification of the Sudan and in respect for
human rights in Darfur. That can be achieved only to
the extent that we not only promote the protection and
defence of human rights, but also help to ensure
economic and social development of the Sudan and the
entire region. Only then can we all feel truly proud.
