The President: The next speaker is Mr. Harri
Holkeri, President of the General Assembly, to whom
the Council has extended an invitation under rule 39 of
its provisional rules of procedure. I invite him to take a
seat at the Council table.

Before giving the floor to Mr. Holkeri, 1 would
like to convey a special word of thanks to him for
taking time off from his busy schedule to address the
Security Council. Rarely have Presidents of the
General Assembly addressed the Council. Indeed, our
research shows that the last time it happened was
probably in 1946 - more than 54 years ago. So this is
in some ways a historic occasion.

I invite Mr. Holkeri to make his statement.
