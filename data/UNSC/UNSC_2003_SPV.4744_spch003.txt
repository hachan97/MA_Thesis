The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Mr. Sharma for the information that he shared with the
Security Council this afternoon, and I thank the
Secretary-General for his report.

I now give the floor to Council members. In
doing so, I should like to recommend that statements
be limited to five minutes so that we can hold this
afternoon's meeting within the planned time frame as
easily as possible.
