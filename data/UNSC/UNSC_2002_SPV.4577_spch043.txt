The President: I would like to sum up by
identifying the key themes which I think emerged out
of our very good discussion this morning. We
identified the need for early international action,
including by the Security Council; the need for a
regional strategy from the beginning; the need for
properly coordinated intervention, both within United
Nations agencies and between the United Nations and
regional players; the need for rapid agreement to an
appropriate and robust mandate for any United Nations
peacekeeping force, backed up with adequate resources
and with the unity of Security Council members; and
the critical role of humanitarian and economic action,
both short-term to alleviate the suffering and longer-
term to sustain post-conflict recovery. In post-conflict
support, security-sector and justice reform was
identified as being absolutely critical. We also touched
on the value of having a lead nation to give focus to
international action and to Security Council action in
conflict areas. And finally, the importance of flexibility
to respond to changing circumstances was highlighted.
I think it came across very strongly that it was
important that we not get locked into strategies which
clearly are not working.

I look forward to this afternoon's discussion. I
hope to have a prompt start at 3 p.m.

With the concurrence of the Council members, I
shall now suspend the meeting until 3 p.m.

The meeting was suspended at 1.10pm.
