The President: I thank Mr. Haekkerup for the
clarifications he has provided.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has completed its business
for this meeting.

I would like to inform the members of the
Council that work on the draft presidential statement is
continuing. The next meeting, to adopt the draft
presidential statement, will be convened at 4 pm.

The meeting rose at 2.25 p.m.
