Ms. Sison (United States of America): We will not
agree to Russia's procedural proposal. The United States
wants this vote on the Joint Investigative Mechanism
(JIM) to take place today. The JIM. needs to be renewed
now, as soon as possible and in a non-politicized way to
keep its important work on track, without interruption.
There is no time to waste. It is not every day that the
Council considers an issue that is so horrific and so
shocking to the conscience as the use of chemical
weapons against civilians. We need to keep this
important work of the JIM. on track.
