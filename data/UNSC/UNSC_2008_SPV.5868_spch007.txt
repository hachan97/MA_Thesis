The President: I thank the Secretary-General for
his statement. I am quite certain that all of us
understand why he had to delay his joining us here this
morning in the Council. Thank you very much,
Mr. Secretary-General.

I now invite The Right Honourable Gordon
Brown, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, to take the floor.
