Ms. Murmokaite (Lithuania): We have a tiny
army and very small reserves of weapons. It is not
exactly right to suggest that Lithuania is providing
armaments to Ukraine. We have provided medical
assistance; we have taken wounded Ukrainian soldiers
into Lithuanian hospitals. That is true. However, it has
nothing to do with all of the heavy weaponry that has
been provided - we know from which side. So let us
not compare forces, because Lithuanian forces - and
we can revisit statistics next time - certainly have
nothing to do with that. Even if we did provide some
armaments, it would be a drop in the ocean. It would
not make a difference.
