Mr. Heusgen (Germany): I sincerely thank the
President of the Commission electorale nationale
independante for his clarifications, which lead me to
the following question. According to the information
that I have, the election results have to be published.
In the President's explanation, I understand that he
said that the details of the elections results will go only
to the Constitutional Court. Perhaps he could clarify
that point, because I think that it is very important that
the elections results, according to the polling stations,
be published, as several speakers around the table
have requested.
