Mr. Urbina (Costa Rica): As Ambassador
Kumalo said, not everyone here is a lawyer. But I am a
lawyer.

(spoke in Spanish)

All I wanted to add is that the Prosecutor has
done his work by presenting his findings to the judges
of the Court, and what we are talking about now is not
the fulfilment of the wishes or the opinions of the
Prosecutor, but the decision of the judges of the Court.
It is important to differentiate, for the role of the
Prosecutor is often confused with that of the Court.

The Council referred the situation in the Sudan to
the Court for investigation. It was investigated by the
Prosecutor, who then requested the issuance of arrest
warrants. The judges then concluded that there was
sufficient evidence to issue those warrants, which they
did. I think that it is now up to the Council to assume
responsibility for the consequences of having referred
the situation in Darfur to the Prosecutor's Office and
the Court.
