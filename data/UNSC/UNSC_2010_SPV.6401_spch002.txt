Mr. Yang Tao (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
Chinese delegation abstained in the voting on the
resolution just adopted. China has serious concerns
over the annual report submitted by the Panel of
Experts on the Sudan, and believes that there is much
room for improvement in the work of the Panel. We
urge the Panel of Experts to conduct its work under the
principles of objectivity and responsibility.
