The President: May I take it that the draft report is
adopted by the Council?

There being no objection, it is so decided.
This decision will be reflected in a note by the
President of the Security Council, to be issued as

document S/1996/935.

The Security Council has thus concluded its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 11.15 am.
