The President (spoke in Spanish): I wish warmly
to thank the President of the Federal Republic of
Nigeria for his clarifications, for his sense of humour,
for his comments and his profound thoughts, and,
above all, his tremendous commitment to continue, on
behalf of his country and of the African Union, to work
to find a solution to the grave problems facing Africa
and Darfur in particular.

I believe that this meeting has been useful to all
members of the Council in clarifying the situation. The
comments, reflections and responses will undoubtedly
be instructive and useful to Council members as we
continue our consideration of the item on our agenda
we are considering as well as in general, as we
continue to consider issues of peace and security in
Africa which are on the Council's agenda.

I am certain that, under the leadership of the
President of Nigeria, and with his commitment and his
vision, today we can conclude our meeting with a
greater feeling of hope that the cooperation between
the Council and the African Union and the general
endeavours of the international community will enable
us in the next few weeks to work with somewhat more
optimism to find a solution to this grave humanitarian
crisis. There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

On behalf of the Council, I wish, once again, very
particularly to thank the President of the Federal
Republic of Nigeria, His Excellency Mr. Olusegun
Obasanjo, for having taken the time to meet with the
Security Council.

I express the wish to see continued and
strengthened collaboration between the United Nations
and the African Union in all matters relating to peace
and security on the Africa continent.

The meeting rose at 12.20 p.m.
