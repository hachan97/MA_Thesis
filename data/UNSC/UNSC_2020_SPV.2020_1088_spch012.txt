I thank High Representative Nakamitsu for her briefing. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines begins by reiterating that the use of chemical weapons anywhere and by anyone constitutes an abominable violation of international law. Chemical-weapons atrocities cannot be ignored and impunity cannot be encouraged. Perpetrators must be held accountable. Therefore, allegations of the use of chemical weapons should never be dismissed. Investigations must be thorough and conducted in accordance with best practices to ensure that all findings can withstand rigorous scrutiny. We continue to support the critically important mandate of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and continue to emphasize that it bears a tremendous responsibility and must therefore take measures to ensure that its views and activities are impartial, independent and free from politicization. We have taken note of the 9 July Executive Council decision and the 14 October report regarding the implementation of that decision. We look forward to a substantive discussion on that issue at the CWC's Conference of the States Parties. We have also taken note of the recent report (see S/2020/1082, annex) of the OPCW's Fact-Finding Mission in the Syrian Arab Republic regarding the alleged use of chemicals as a weapon in Saraqib on | August 2016. We are in the process of reviewing that report in a comprehensive manner. The Council should not overlook the many notifications by the Syrian Government that various armed groups operating in Syria may be preparing to use chemical weapons. We have an obligation to duly consider that possibility and to make an assessment in that regard in order to protect the lives of civilians.
