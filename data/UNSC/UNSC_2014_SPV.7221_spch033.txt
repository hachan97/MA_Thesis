Mr. Rishchynski (Canada): Canada mourns the
terrible loss of lives of those aboard Malaysia Airlines
Flight MH-l7 and wholeheartedlyjoins the co-sponsors
of resolution 2166 (2014), which strongly condemns
the atrocity. We urge an immediate, comprehensive,
credible and unimpeded international investigation
into the event, in accordance with the guidelines set
up by the International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO). Time is of the essence, and it is vital that the
pro-Russian groups currently in control of the crash
site impede neither the work of investigative teams
nor efforts to recover and repatriate the remains of the
victims.

(spoke in French)

Canada welcomes the statement issued on 17 July
by the trilateral contact group. However, declarations
are not enough. Russia and the pro-Russia militants
must match words with deeds and cooperate fully with
the investigation. The conflict in eastern Ukraine has
been both generated by and perpetrated by the Putin
regime. Evidence of Russian financial and material
support to illegal armed groups in eastern Ukraine
is both clear and compelling, and President Putin's
continued support for those groups constitutes a threat
to international peace and security. President Putin has
the ability to end this war. He can do so by ending his
support to pro-Russian forces, ending the build-up of
troops on the Ukrainian border, withdrawing his troops
from Crimea and using Russia's considerable influence
to broker a ceasefire.

(spoke in English)

The need for answers, for justice and for respect
for the victims' grieving friends and family members
should unite all of us here today. Canada, as a nation
and as host State to ICAO, stands ready to provide
whatever support it can towards those ends. There must
be justice. And to have justice, there must be truth.
