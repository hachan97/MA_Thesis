The President (spoke in Chinese): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Australia, Fiji, New Zealand and
Papua New Guinea in which they request to be invited
to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Aisi (Papua New Guinea) took a seat at the Council table;
Mr. Dauth (Australia), Mr. Naidu (Fiji) and
Mr. MacKay (New Zealand) took the seats
reserved for them at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The President (spoke in Chinese): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Kieran Prendergast, Under-Secretary-
General for Political Affairs.

It is so decided.

The Security Council Will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Kieran Prendergast, Under-Secretary-
General for Political Affairs, to whom I give the floor.
