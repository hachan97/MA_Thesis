The President (spoke in Chinese): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of China.

We have taken note of the fact that divergent
opinions remain with regard to elements of the draft
resolution before us. We had proposed pursuing the
process of consultations in order to arrive at a text
acceptable to all. The Chinese delegation will vote in
favour of the draft resolution because we believe that
an extension of the mandate of the United Nations
Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara will
help to maintain stability and peace in that region and
assist the parties concerned, with the Secretary-General
and his Personal Envoy, in finding an appropriate,
feasible and lasting solution to existing problems. We
hope that, in this process, the views of the parties
concerned will be carefully heeded so as to prevent
new problems from arising in the region.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

I shall now put the draft resolution (S/2000/500)
to the vote.

A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:

Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, China, France,
Malaysia, Netherlands, Russian Federation,
Tunisia, Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of
America

Against:
Namibia
Abstaining:
Jamaica, Mali

The President (spoke in Chinese): There were 12
votes in favour, 1 against and 2 abstentions. The draft
resolution has been adopted as resolution 1301 (2000).

I shall now call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements following the voting.
