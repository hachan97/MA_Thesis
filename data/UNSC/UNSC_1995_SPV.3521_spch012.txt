Mr. Fulci (Italy): The recent cowardly murder of
two French UNPROFOR soldiers in Sarajevo is for us,
also, a source of profound sorrow and strong indignation.
These feelings were expressed personally by the Italian
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mrs. Agnelli, in her
statement here in New York yesterday at the NPT Review
and Extension Conference. And even as we speak a wire
has just arrived from Gorazde with the news that a mine
blast there has wounded three British soldiers, one of
them seriously. Three more victims. We cannot but feel
even greater anxiety and indignation.

Italy therefore supported with full conviction the
draft resolution proposed by France.

Today's resolution underlines three closely
connected questions: the security of UNPROFOR
personnel, which is indispensable for the continuation of
the operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina; the need for an
extension of the agreement for a cease-fire and a
cessation of hostilities - whose expiration date, we
would do well to remember, is dangerously near; and,
finally, the need for a restoration of the negotiation
process for a comprehensive and peaceful settlement of
the Bosnian crisis.

My Government has followed with extreme concern
the increasing violation of the cease-fire in recent weeks.
We believe that these incidents raise dramatically the
serious threat of a general return to fighting, which would
of course lead to new suffering for the sorely tried
Bosnian people: hence the importance, in our view, for
the international community to issue a new, vigorous
signal to all the Bosnian parties to convince them that
there is no military solution to the present conflict and to
induce all of them to respect the lives, dignity, and
freedom of movement of the international forces that have
thus far played, and that continue to play - at the cost of

 
great personal sacrifice - a fundamental role in trying to
bring peace and humanitarian assistance to an afflicted
people.
