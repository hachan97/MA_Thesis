Mr. De La Sabliere (France) (spoke in French):
At the outset, I welcome the presence among us of the
Secretary-General at this important meeting.

France, Germany and Russia decided to support
the resolution we have just adopted and to agree on the
text of a joint statement to be issued here in New York.

With so much at stake, we feel that the text of the
resolution should have gone farther. It would have been
extremely desirable in particular for a clear text to set
nearer and stricter deadlines for the transfer of
responsibilities and the political transition. We also
remain convinced that, in order to allow for the
reconstruction and stabilization of Iraq, the sovereign
assumption by the Iraqis of their own destiny is a
necessary starting point to restore political prospects
for the Iraqis; to marginalize those in Iraq who have
chosen violence; and to mobilize the international
community on behalf of Iraq. Furthermore, we believe
that it is absolutely necessary for the United Nations to
play a lead role in assistance to the Iraqi people in
successfully managing the political process.

We recognize, however, that the authors of the
resolution, throughout the negotiations, took a number
of our amendments into consideration - with regard,
for example, to the roles of the Security Council and
the Secretary-General or to transparency in the use of
the Development Fund for Iraq. The text can also
create institutional momentum in the right direction.

In the context of the spiral of violence and
terrorism in Iraq and of extreme tension in the Middle
East as a whole, we wish to make unity in the Council
a priority. We wish to believe that today's resolution
marks a first step that we feel will be followed by
others, equally indispensable.
