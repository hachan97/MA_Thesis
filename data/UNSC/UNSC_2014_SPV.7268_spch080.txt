Mr. Kasse (Mali) (spoke in French): The United
States of America has the reputation for being at the
cutting edge. Mr. President, you have just proved that
fact once again by organizing this important meeting
on Ebola following the meeting on AIDS in Africa
that your country organized in this same Chamber
in January 2000 (See S/PV.4087). I congratulate the
United States presidency on the excellent manner in
which it is directing the work of the Security Council
in this month of September and the place it has given to
Africa in its agenda.

Taking the floor at this late hour, I will limit
myself to emphasizing the Ebola virus disease is not
new in Africa, but the epidemic currently affecting the
western part of our continent is unprecedented in terms
of propagation and the number of affected persons and
victims.

Mali, together with affected brother countries,
is making an effort at the bilateral, subregional and
regional levels to implement the measures recommended
by the African regional bodies. Today, Mali joins
the international community in contributing to the
appropriate international response fto this formidable
epidemic. Mali welcomes the initiative of the highest
American authorities and welcomes the strong
mobilization around that promising initiative. We ask
that we move forward urgently and in a coordinated
manner, taking appropriate action, for the Ebola virus
will not wait and does not observe formalities as it
moves from one country to another, from one region to
another all around the world.

Mali supports the creation of the United Nations
Mission for Ebola Emergency Response proposed by
the Secretary-General. That United Nations Mission
should not be just one more mission. Finally, Mali was
a sponsor of resolution 2177 (2014), which was just
adopted unanimously and which now must be urgently
implemented.
