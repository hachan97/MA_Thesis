The President (spoke in French): Unless I hear
any objection, under rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure I invite the
representative of Cote d'Ivoire to participate in this
meeting.

It is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2011/299, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by France and Lebanon.

I wish to also draw the attention of Council
members to documents S/2OIl/297 and S/2011/295,
containing letters from the Secretary-General dated
11 May 2011 and 9 May 2011, respectively.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.

I shall first call on members of the Council who
wish to make statements before the voting.
