Mr. Verbeke (Belgium) (spoke in French):
Belgium voted in favour of resolution 1803 (2008), and
we welcome its adoption by a very large majority.
Belgium took note with great interest of the statement
issued by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of China,
France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the United
Kingdom and the United States, with the support of the
European Union High Representative.

Belgium regrets that Iran has still not complied
with the decisions of the Security Council aimed at the
suspension of uranium-enrichment activities and
projects linked to heavy water, or with measures set out
by the Board of Governors of the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA). Belgium notes that in his
report of 22 February the Director General of the IAEA
concludes again that he is not able to provide
assurances regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear
material and activities in Iran, or regarding the
exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear
programme.
Belgium considers that this new resolution is part
of a gradual approach of adopting sanctions that are
proportionate, targeted and reversible; above all, we
seek to urge the Iranian authorities to adopt a more
cooperative and transparent position in order to restore
trust. Belgium stresses that the path of good-faith
negotiations remains open to Iran on the basis of the
proposals made to it in June 2006.
