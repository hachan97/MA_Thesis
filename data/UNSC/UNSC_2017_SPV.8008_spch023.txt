Mr. Mogae: If it is a question of asking what
my wishes are, I wish that the United Nations, the
African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on
Development (IGAD) would speak with one voice. That
is what I want them to do. At present, their approaches
are not quite the same, and the South Sudanese will
continue to take advantage of differences in approach.
Also, I think that the authorities - the African Union,
IGAD and the United Nations - could maybe warn the
South Sudanese much more firmly that these entities
mean what they say.
