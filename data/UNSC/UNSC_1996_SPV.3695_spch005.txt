Mr. Fulci (Italy): Italy voted in favour of the
resolution because in matters such as the Burundi crisis,
it is essential that the country show unanimity. But I
would be remiss if, on this occasion, I did not call the
Council's attention to document S/ 1996/673 of 19 August
1996, which contains a letter from the Irish Presidency of

 

the European Union and the Presidency declaration, on
behalf of the Union, on Burundi. Allow me simply to quote
the two main paragraphs of that declaration:

"The European Union wishes to express its
support for the regional leaders, the Organization of
African Unity and the former President of the United
Republic of Tanzania, Mr. Julius Nyerere, in the
efforts that they have been making to assist Burundi
to peacefully overcome the grave crisis it is
experiencing and encourages them to continue in their
efforts to facilitate the search for a political solution.

"The European Union considers it essential that
a dialogue be organized without delay, bringing
together all of Burundi's political forces, without
exception, including representatives of civil society, in
order to negotiate a democratic institutional consensus
and ensuring security for all."

This is the second time in one month that the Security
Council has expressed its clear position on the coup d 'etat
in Burundi. We have fully subscribed to this position. We
believe that now the time has come to replace confrontation
with dialogue, dialogue of all with all, and to see what
fruits this will produce. Therefore, Italy appeals to all the
parties in Burundi to exercise restraint and to show a really
constructive attitude, in order to put the country back on the
track of democracy, national reconciliation, economic
reconstruction and development, without which there can be
no lasting peace.
