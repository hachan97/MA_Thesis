Mr. Oshima (Japan): I join in warmly welcoming
President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf to this Chamber. On
behalf of the Government of Japan, I wish to extend
once again our sincere congratulations to the President
of the Republic of Liberia on her inauguration.

We trust that, in meeting the many daunting
challenges Liberia faces in overcoming the legacies of
the decade-long civil war, the Government and people
of Liberia will be united under the leadership of the
President and will make every effort to consolidate the
hard-won peace and move steadfastly towards its
recovery, reconstruction, national reconciliation and a
new nation-building effort.

To support that national effort, the international
community must respond, not only with good will, but
also by mobilizing substantial support for and
assistance to Liberia. For its part, the Security Council
will have to address such matters as the future
activities of the United Nations Mission in Liberia, the
lifting of the sanctions and the issue of impunity, in
close consultation with the new Government.

As the special envoy of Prime Minister Koizumi,
Mr. Shintaro Ito, already conveyed in January, Japan,
as a friend of Liberia and of Africa, will be pleased to
join in accelerated and sustained international
cooperation for Liberia as it embarks on a new journey.
We will be working in partnership and solidarity with
the Government and people of Liberia, including for
community-based development, the reintegration of
child soldiers, anti-proliferation of small arms, and
other reconstruction and development projects. It is the
hope of my Government that friendship between our
two countries will be strengthened through close
dialogue and cooperation with the President, the
Government and the people of Liberia.

We wish the President and people of Liberia well
with their success and we wish them a better future.
