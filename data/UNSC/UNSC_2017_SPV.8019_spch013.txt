Mr. Sadykov (Kazakhstan): We support the
adoption of resolution 2371 (2017), which envisages
tough sanctions as a means to persuade Pyongyang to
change its course in favour of a nuclear-weapon-free
future. The resolution also leaves room for the
resumption of dialogue or a six-party mechanism
for negotiations.

Kazakhstan strongly condemns as irresponsible
and dangerous North Korea's international-range
ballistic-missile launches as they undermine our
shared international efforts to strengthen regional
and, ultimately, international peace and security. Such
actions are in serious violation of Security Council
resolutions and pose a threat to peace. Furthermore,
they destabilize the situation in the North-East Asia
region, as well as globally.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea's
irresponsible policy negatively affects the global
process of nuclear non-proliferation and undermines
our collective efforts to ensure a nuclear-weapon-free
future for the planet. We urge the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions for
the sake of the security and development of its people
and for the benefit of all humankind.

The threat of the missile and nuclear programmes
of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea makes it
imperative for all parties concerned to intensify their
efforts to find a mutually acceptable solution through
the early resumption of negotiations. A solution to
this situation is possible only through dialogue and
not through any military strategy triggered by the
provocative actions of the North Korean authorities.
