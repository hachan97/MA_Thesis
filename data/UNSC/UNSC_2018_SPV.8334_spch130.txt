The President: There are no further names

inscribed on the list of speakers.

That leaves me, as President, to thank all of the
participants in today's meeting. In particular, I would
like to thank the Security Council Affairs Division for
its support, as well as the interpreter for their tireless
work throughout a long day.

We will be following up today's open debate with a
President's summary, which will summarize the points
made. We will distribute that in due course.

The meeting rose at 5pm.
