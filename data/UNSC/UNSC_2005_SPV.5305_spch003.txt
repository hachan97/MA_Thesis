The President (spoke in Russian): I thank
Ambassador De La Sabliere for his briefing.

On behalf of the Council, I should like once again
to express gratitude and appreciation to all the
members of the Security Council mission, very ably
led by Ambassador De La Sabliere, for the manner in
which they discharged their important responsibilities
on behalf of the Council.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of this
matter.
