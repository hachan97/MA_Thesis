The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Germany, in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Hanz
(Germany) took the seat reserved for him at the
side of the Council Chamber:

The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/624, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Belgium, China, Croatia,
France, Germany, Italy, the Russian Federation, the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and the United States of America.

It is my understand that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall now give the floor to members of the
Council wishing to make statements before the voting.
