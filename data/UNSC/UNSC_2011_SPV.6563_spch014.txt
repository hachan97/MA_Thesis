Mr. Salam (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): I would
like to thank Ambassador Osorio for his 90-day report
on the work of the Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1737 (2006). We very much appreciate the
work of the Committee and reiterate our readiness to
continue to cooperate with it. Allow me to make the
following observations.

Resolution 1929 (2010) and all other related
resolutions confirmed the right of all parties to develop
nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The resolution
also affirms the importance of political and diplomatic
efforts for seeking negotiated solutions to this issue.
We therefore call for the relaunching of negotiations
and a return to dialogue, which is the best way to find a
comprehensive solution that will open a new chapter
on cooperation with the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Lebanon was one of the first countries to join the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
(NPT). We are a party to all essential international
instruments against the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction. We also fulfil our obligations in that
regard.

Lebanon hopes to see the dream of a nuclear-
weapon-free zone in the Middle East become reality. In
that regard, we reiterate the importance of the Final
Document of the 2010 NPT Review Conference
(NPT/CONF.2010/50 (Vol. I)), which called upon
Israel to accede to the NPT, as it is the only country in
the Middle East that has not yet done so, and to submit
its nuclear facilities to the IAEA comprehensive
safeguards agreement regime.
