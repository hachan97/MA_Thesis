The President: I thank the representative of the
Syrian Arab Republic for his kind words addressed to
me.

The next speaker on my list is the representative
of the Philippines. On behalf of the Council, I welcome
him to the United Nations. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
