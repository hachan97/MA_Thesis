Mr. Qin Huasun (China) (interpretation from Chinese): The Chinese delegation has noted that it has not
been possible to reach the quota for the sale of oil in the 90
days after the entry into force of Security Council
resolution 1111 (1997) as scheduled. We believe that this
is a totally technical issue that should not be politicized.

The Chinese delegation wishes to emphasize here that
the fundamental aim of the implementation of Security
Council resolutions 986 (1995) and 1111 (1997) is to
alleviate the humanitarian situation in Iraq. Although Iraq
has exported oil, the delivery of humanitarian goods has
been delayed, which is not in keeping with the spirit of the
resolution. In his report submitted 90 days after the
resolution was adopted, the Secretary-General points out
that the delay in the delivery of humanitarian goods has had
a negative impact on the people of Iraq. We are deeply
concerned about this issue, and we strongly urge all sides
concerned to accelerate the delivery process so that
humanitarian goods can be delivered to Iraq at an early
date.

For the smooth implementation of the resolution on oil

for food in order to alleviate the humanitarian situation in

Iraq, the Chinese delegation will vote in favour of the draft

resolution before us.
