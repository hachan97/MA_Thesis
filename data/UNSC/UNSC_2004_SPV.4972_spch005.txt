Mr. Duclos (France) (spoke in French): France
voted in favour of the resolution just adopted because
we believed it essential that the Security Council react
swiftly and firmly in the light of the brutal
deterioration of the situation in Gaza. It was necessary
that the Council make an appeal to reason and restraint,
as had already been done by the European Union and
by the Secretary-General, whose presence I welcome
this afternoon.

France is dismayed at the violence of the last few
days and expresses its sympathy to the civilian
population affected by Israeli military operations.
France, like the European Union, has condemned the
large-scale demolition of Palestinian houses in Rafah.
That was disproportionate and contrary to international
law and to Israel's obligations under the road map.
Those obligations were specifically recalled by the
Quartet during its 4 May meeting in New York.
Similarly, France expects the Palestinian Authority to
undertake more determined action in the area of
security, particularly with regard to the fight against
terrorism.

The house demolitions and the military
operations must cease immediately. There is an urgent
need for the establishment of a ceasefire that includes
all the parties and all the groups and for the immediate
implementation by the Palestinian Authority and the
Government of Israel of their obligations under the
road map.
