The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo in which he requests to be invited to participate
in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda.
In accordance with the usual practice, I propose, with
the consent of the Council, to invite that representative
to participate in the discussion without the right to
vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Ileko
(Democratic Republic of the Congo) took a seat
at the Council table.

The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Ms. Carolyn McAskie, Emergency Relief
Coordinator ad interim, Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Ms. McAskie to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by the Emergency Relief Coordinator ad
interim of the Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs, Ms. Carolyn McAskie, to whom
I give the floor.
