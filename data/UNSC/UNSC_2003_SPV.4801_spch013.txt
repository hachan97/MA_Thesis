Mr. Gatilov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We too would like to express our satisfaction
with the decision that has been taken by the Security
Council. It is important that the resolution that has
been adopted opens up the way for the continuation of
the peace process on the basis of Mr. James Baker's
peace plan. At the same time, it does not impose a final
solution to the problem upon the sides. That solution
will be worked out jointly in the negotiating process
among the parties and the United Nations.
We also consider it very significant that the
Security Council has been able to demonstrate its
capacity to come to an important consensus decision on
a difficult problem on its agenda.
