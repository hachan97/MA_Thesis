The President: Thank you, Mr. Ambassador, for your
kind words. What you refer to as my first presidency is also
undoubtedly going to be my last. That is either good news
or bad news; it depends on your point of View.

With the permission of Ambassador Gatilov, I would
now like to call on Foreign Minister Dlamini-Zuma of
South Africa, who will have to leave shortly, and ask her
if she would like to make any informal observations about
what she has heard over the last two and a half hours, and
whether she has any final thoughts for us.
