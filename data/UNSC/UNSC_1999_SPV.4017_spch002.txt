Mr. Shen Guofang (China) (Spoke in Chinese): The
Chinese delegation attaches importance to the desire of
Nauru to be admitted to membership in the United Nations,
and has carried out serious study with regard to its
application. In considering the admission of Nauru to the
United Nations, we believe it most essential that the
purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter
should be fully complied with, that General Assembly
resolution 2758 (XXVI) of 1971 should be implemented
and that the new Member should fulfil its Charter
obligations and comply with General Assembly
resolutions.

On the basis of this principled position, the Chinese
delegation cannot support the recommendation by the
Council to the General Assembly concerning the
admission of Nauru to the membership of the United
Nations. At the same time, considering the long-term
interests of the peoples of China and Nauru, and given
the request of South Pacific countries, we will not block
this recommendation.

We hope that after it joins the United Nations, Nauru
will strictly comply with resolutions of the United
Nations, including General Assembly resolution 2758
(XXVI).
