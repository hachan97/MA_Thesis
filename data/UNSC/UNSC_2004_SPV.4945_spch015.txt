Mr. Baja (Philippines): We thank you,
Mr. President, for convening this meeting. What we
have in this afternoon's meeting is a reprise of what we
had three weeks ago. Therefore, it bears repeating what
we stated in the Security Council's public meeting at
that time: that the Philippine Government condemns
any and all extrajudicial killings committed by any
party in the Middle East conflict. Such actions are
gross violations of human rights and contrary to
international law. We hope that we do not have to meet
yet again in the context of another scenario similar to
today's.

We are deeply concerned that violence in the
Middle East has continued, despite the declared
aversion of the international community, including the
Security Council, to such a policy. The Middle East
will not see peace unless the pattern of attack and
reprisal is stopped on both sides. We are gravely
concerned that, unless strong political will is exercised
on all sides to curtail the terrorism and the violence,
the path of peace will not succeed. Like others, we call
on all sides to exercise restraint and to refrain from acts
of violence, which will further escalate the situation.
We appeal to them to follow the path of peaceful
negotiations to achieve the goal of two States living
side by side in peace and security, in accordance with
Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973)
and 1397 (2002).

There is a new equation in the litany of peace
initiatives for the Middle East. At this juncture, we can
only hope that the so-called disengagement plan does
not kill the road map and the work of the Quartet.
Notwithstanding its noble intentions - and although
we appreciate its positive prospects - it suffers from a
factory defect: it is not a product of negotiation
between the parties on the ground, whose lives and
future are at stake. We thus urge a restarting of the
Middle East process established under the road map,
which the Security Council endorsed in its resolution
1515 (2003).
