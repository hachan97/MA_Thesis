The President (spoke in French): I warmly thank
Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello for his outstanding briefing,
which was full of information and very clear on the
current situation and on the progress achieved. The
briefing was full of concrete proposals. Mr. Vieira de
Mello has given us an outlook that is both realistic and
ambitious.
