Mr. Cazeau (Haiti) (spoke in French): My
delegation has asked for the floor simply to
congratulate you, Sir, and to thank the Secretary-
General for his report on the situation in Haiti
(S/2009/530) and the Council for the resolution it has
just adopted. The adoption of this resolution confirms
once again the sustained commitment of the Security
Council and the international community to my
country.

On this occasion, we should like to reiterate the
heartfelt sorrow of the people and Government of Haiti
and of its Permanent Mission to the United Nations
following the terrible plane crash of Friday, 9 October
2009, that claimed the lives of 11 valorous, talented
and dedicated peacemakers from Uruguay and Jordan.
They laid down their lives in the line of duty in Haiti
under the auspices of the United Nations Stabilization
Mission in Haiti.

We bow humbly before their remains and offer
our prayers and words of comfort to their Government,
family members, parents, friends, loved ones and
colleagues in the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations. The loss of these soldiers of peace will not
have been in vain. They carried out a just and righteous
fight, and earned a place in our collective memory.
