The President: I thank Mark Malloch Brown for the
immense contribution which he, like the World Bank under
Jim Wolfensohn, makes on this issue.

Before calling on the next speaker, I would like to
acknowledge - and I apologize for not doing this
earlier - our newest member of the Security Council, who
presented his credentials this morning, the new Ambassador
from Argentina. Welcome. Also, I want to welcome to the
Security Council the five new members - Bangladesh,
Jamaica, Mali, Tunisia and Ukraine - and to thank the
departing members for their participation. I look forward to
working with you all over the next few weeks.

It is now my honour to call on the head of the Joint
United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS),
Dr. Peter Piot.
