Mr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): My
country fully supports the report of the Counter-
Terrorism Committee, presented by the Chairman. I
will refer very briefly to the important need to
revitalize the Committee.

The Counter-Terrorism Committee has carried out
praiseworthy work that may nonetheless prove to be
sorely inadequate in the short term. I say this in full
knowledge of the situation. The United Nations cannot
and should not spare any effort in combating that very
serious threat to peace. The report approved by the
Committee and summarized earlier by the Chairman
seeks precisely to strengthen most seriously the
flexibility, visibility and, above all, effectiveness of the
Committee and the United Nations in the fight against
terrorism.

Terrorism and the campaign against it require a
concerted and operative effort on the part of the
international community. The report before us,
avoiding rhetoric and cosmetic proposals, seeks the
objective of achieving a united, operational and more
effective Committee. I therefore reiterate our support
for the report.
