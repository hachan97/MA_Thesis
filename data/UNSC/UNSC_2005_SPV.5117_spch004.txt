Mr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): Algeria
joined other members of the Security Council in voting
in favour of the draft resolution on renewing the
mandate of the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL). It did so once the concerns it had
expressed had largely been taken into account by the
country that prepared the original text, and I should
like to thank that delegation for the flexibility it
demonstrated.

Negotiations turned out to be rather difficult
because of efforts to introduce political elements
which, we feel, were not appropriate in a text of this
nature.

Algeria, which attaches the greatest importance to
UNIFIL's continued mission in Lebanon and to the
integrity of its mandate, would like to recall that only
Israel's full withdrawal from all Arab territories
occupied by force - namely Palestinian territory,
including Al-Quds Al-Sharif; the Syrian Golan; and
Shaba'a Farms - can lead to a just, lasting and
comprehensive settlement of the Israeli-Arab conflict.
