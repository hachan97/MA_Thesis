Mr. Qin Huasun (China) (interpretation from Chinese): Civil aviation not only involves the safety of the
people of all countries but is also closely related to the
sovereignty of those countries, to which due attention
should be paid. Therefore, the Council has considered the
draft resolution before us on many occasions.

The Chinese delegation expresses its regret over the
casualties caused by the shooting down of the two civil
aircraft. We are of the view that the principles of
international law should be implemented in a
comprehensive, fair and balanced manner. No country
should apply selectivity to their implementation in
accordance with its own needs. Therefore, we maintain that
the provisions of international law on the non-use of
weapons against civil aircraft should be respected; by the
same token, those on the inviolability of territorial airspace
and those against the abuse of civil aviation must also be
observed.

The Council of the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) has considered all aspects of this
question and has adopted a resolution on it. We believe that
this resolution is a balanced and fair one which represents
the collective will of all the members of ICAO. Therefore,
the Chinese delegation repeatedly emphasized during the
consultations that the Council should base its actions on this
resolution and adopt the same fair and balanced approach.
We accordingly put forward reasonable amendments to the
draft resolution before us.

Regrettably, however, despite some efforts by the
sponsor, the key amendments proposed by the parties
concerned were not accepted. This has given the current
draft resolution a biased tilt. Therefore, the Chinese
delegation will abstain in the vote on the draft resolution
before us.
