Mr. Sidorov (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian): The Russian Federation is seriously concerned
by the complex situation in Liberia and by the prospect that
the country will slip into the abyss of chaos and civil war,
so threatening the civilian population with new disasters
without number and the region with further destabilization.
We note with regret that, almost four months after the
signing of the Accra Agreement, the Liberian parties have
basically implemented not one of its fundamental provisions
and have failed to resolve the most urgent problem, that of
establishing a Council of State. As a result of this most
irresponsible approach to the fate of their country and its
people on the part of the leaders of the armed groups, the
peace process in Liberia remains deadlocked: the cease-fire
has been broken, and an increase in hostilities has been
reported, accompanied by human rights violations on a
massive scale.

The Russian delegation voted in favour of the draft
resolution just adopted because, firstly, it gives the Liberian
parties a clear signal that the international community is
prepared to continue to render assistance in settling the
conflict while also containing a clear warning that the
outcome the next time the Council considers the future role
of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia will
hinge mainly on how far the Liberians themselves succeed

 
in making progress towards re-establishing the peace
process before the Mission's mandate expires on 30 June.

We believe that this is one of the last - if not the
last - real chances for a peaceful settlement to the crisis
in Liberia, and it must not be missed. We hope that the
forthcoming ECOWAS summit meeting will play an
important and constructive role in resolving the protracted
conflict in Liberia, and in re-establishing the peace
process. We believe that the decision in the resolution to
establish a Security Council Committee to monitor
compliance with the embargo imposed under Security
Council resolution 788 (1992) will really help normalize
the situation not only in Liberia but in the region as a
whole. In this connection, we urgently call on all States,
especially Liberia's neighbours, to help improve the
effectiveness of the embargo on weapons supplies to
Liberia, and to cooperate fully with the Committee.
