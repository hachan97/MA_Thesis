The President: In accordance with the understanding
reached in the Council's prior consultations, and in the
absence of objection, I shall take it that the Security
Council agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Hedi Annabi,
Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
I invite Mr. Annabi to take a seat at the Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by the Assistant Secretary-General for
Peacekeeping Operations on the situation concerning East
Timor.

I should like to draw the attention of members of the
Council to document S/1999/1248, letter dated 14
December 1999 from the Secretary-General transmitting a
letter dated 10 December 1999 from the Permanent
Representative of Australia to the United Nations and the
fifth periodic report on the operations of the International
Force, East Timor (INTERFET).

I now call on Mr. Annabi, Assistant Secretary-General
for Peacekeeping Operations.
