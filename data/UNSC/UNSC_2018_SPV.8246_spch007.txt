Mr. Shen Bo (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
expresses its appreciation to the United Nations
Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, which
is committed to implementing the Security Council's
mandate in earnest and has made efforts to maintain
regional stability. We support the extension of the
Mission's mandate and support it in continuing to play
a constructive role in searching for a solution to the
question of Western Sahara.

The situation in Western Sahara is complex. The
priority is to maintain regional stability and to create
favourable conditions for the restart of the political
process. Therefore, the Council should remain united
and speak with one voice. During the negotiations,
amendments were proposed. The Council should
have been given more time to seek consensus. To take
hasty action on a draft resolution when there are still
differences affects the unity among Council members.
China expresses regret over the fact that resolution
2414 (2018) failed to fully accommodate the concerns
of the parties affected, and was compelled to abstain in
the voting.

China's position on the question of Western Sahara

is consistent and remains unchanged. We will continue
to proceed from ajust and objective standpoint, support
the United Nations in promoting a political solution
to the question and support the mediation efforts by
Personal Envoy Kohler. We encourage both parties to
base their efforts on the relevant Council resolutions
and seek a fair, lasting and mutually acceptable solution
through negotiations.
