The President (spoke in French): I thank
Ms. Sellassie for her clarifications to the questions posed.

I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the
representative of Chad.

My question was not just limited to cooperation.
When I asked how the strategy for the Sahel could
coordinate all the different initiatives, I had in mind
the Nouakchott process, the Group of Five Sahel,
the Coordination Platform and, in particular, the
Multinational Joint Task Force for the Lake Chad
Basin. All those endeavours converge in a single goal,
which is to combat terrorism and reduce insecurity. I
simply wanted to know whether the Special Enovy had
an approach to bring all those efforts together and to
channel energies. I do not mean for her to respond to me
now, in public. I hope we can continue our conversation
after the meeting.

I once again resume my functions as President of
the Council.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at noon.
