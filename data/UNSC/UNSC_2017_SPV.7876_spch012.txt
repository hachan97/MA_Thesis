Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): I thank
Under-Secretary-General Feltman; Ambassador Apakan,
Chief Monitor of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission
to Ukraine; and Under-Secretary-General O'Brien for
their briefings.

China has been following the situation in eastern
Ukraine closely, and is concerned about the recurring
hostilities that have resulted in civilian casualties.
We have taken note of the fact that the Normandy
format and the Trilateral Contact Group in Minsk
held consultations on the implementation of the Minsk
agreements and promoting a peaceful resolution to the
Ukranian issue. We call on the parties to the conflict
to strictly abide by the ceasefire regime and remain
committed to a political solution. There must be a
fundamental and long-term solution to this conflict
that will both accommodate the legitimate rights and
aspirations of all regions and ethnic groups and address
the reasonable concerns of all the parties concerned, in
order to strike a balance among the interests of all sides.

China is of the View that all parties should fully
implement resolution 2202 (2015), enforce the cessation
of hostilities and violence and implement the Minsk
agreements. They must remain committed to seeking
a comprehensive, lasting and balanced solution to the
Ukranian issue through dialogue and consultation, so
as to help achieve peace, stability and development
in Ukraine, harmonious relations among all ethnic
groups and peaceful coexistence between Ukraine and
countries of the region. The international community
should continue to support every diplomatic effort for
a political solution. Council discussions on the issue
should contribute to the easing of tensions on the
ground and a proper solution to the Ukranian question.
