The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

As this is the last meeting of the Council for
the month of January, I would like to express the
sincere appreciation of the delegation of Jordan to the
members of the Council, especially my colleagues the
Permanent Representatives, their respective staff and
the secretariat of the Council for all the support that
they have given to us.

It has been a busy month, in which we rallied to
consensus on several important issues within our
purview. We could not have done it alone and without
the hard work, support and positive contributions
of every delegation and the representatives of the
Secretariat, as well as the interpreters, translators,
meetings services personnel and sound engineers. As
we end our presidency, I know that I speak on behalf
of the Council in wishing the delegation of Lithuania
good luck in its presidency of the Council in the month
of February.

The meeting rose at 11 am.
