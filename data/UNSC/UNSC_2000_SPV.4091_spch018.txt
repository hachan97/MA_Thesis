The President: I should now like to call for a brief
suspension of the meeting while the Secretary-General
escorts President Mandela out of the Chamber. We will
resume in about three or four minutes. I hope all
participants and observers will stay, because we still wish
to hear from the Ambassadors of Jamaica, Namibia,
Ukraine, Malaysia, Russia, Bangladesh and the Netherlands.

The meeting was suspended at 11.50 am. and
resumed at noon.

The President: President Mandela has asked me again
to convey his deep regret that he could not stay for the
entire meeting; I have promised him that we will provide
him with the texts of the remaining statements.

I should like to inform the Council that I have
received a letter from the representative of Burundi, in
which he requests to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Ntahomvukiye
(Burundi) took a seat at the Council table.
