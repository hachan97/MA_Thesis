The President: I have 18 speakers on my list. I
would like to suggest to colleagues to aim to conclude
by 1 pm. That would actually be quite a sensible
objective. If that were acceptable, the logical
consequence would allow three minutes, on average,
per intervention. I state those two facts, and I will now
go through the list. But I shall live in hope.
