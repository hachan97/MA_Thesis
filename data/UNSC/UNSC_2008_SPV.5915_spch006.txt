Mr. Kumalo (South Africa): I shall be very brief,
because I fully agree with the report that Ambassador
Sawers has just given. However, there is one issue that
I want to highlight. In my humble opinion, the Council
needs to pay much more attention to the African
Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur
(UNAMID). I was among those who, I suppose
because we were on the ground, were very shocked at
how under-resourced UNAMID is. Of course, that is
simply because UNAMID is still being put together.

But I want to put on record that this under-
resourcing of UNAMID is something that has to be
watched. I will give two quick examples. When we
visited the people in the camp in Darfur, who told us
that they did not feel safe there, that they were afraid,
that they might be attacked, it was very humbling to
realize that UNAMID was not at the strength that
would enable it to actually respond to those people's
fears. That is very worrisome. The humanitarian
workers talked about the difficult, at times very unsafe
conditions under which they have to service the people
in the camps and UNAMID. They also spoke about
corridors of safety that allow them to do their work.
UNAMID is nowhere near up to strength such that it
can help in that way.

I am bringing this up to say that, as we work on
that issue in the future, I think the issue of UNAMID,
its strength and the conditions under which it operates
really needs more attention from the Council to assist
our colleagues in the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations and our extremely valiant UNAMID friends
on the ground to do their work even better.
