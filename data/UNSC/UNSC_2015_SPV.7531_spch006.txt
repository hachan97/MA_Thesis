Mr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We supported resolution 2240 (2015) on
combatting illegal migration in the Mediterranean,
aware of the scale of the tragedy and the need for
measures to be taken to save human lives. Furthermore,
our delegation would like to point out that headway in
truly resolving the current crisis is unlikely without
addressing the root causes of migration through
tackling the crises in the Middle East and North Africa,
working closely with countries of origin and transit and
undertaking collective efforts at the international level
to establish an effective mechanism of response to the
problems of refugees and migrants.

We expect those who will be putting this resolution
into practice to strictly comply with the relevant norms
of international law, including the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea and, as a priority,
ensuring the security of migrants. Any expansive
interpretation of the resolution is unacceptable. The
resolution is eminently straightforward and provides
for a number of absolutely clear requirements.

Measures on the high seas off the coast of Libya
that are sanctioned by the resolution, as the text clearly
states, should be consistent with the specific situation
and carried out with the goal of saving the lives of
migrants or the victims ofhuman trafficking and only as
part of dealing with entities involved in the smuggling
of migrants and human trafficking on the high seas off
the coast of Libya. Moreover, a top priority is ensuring
the safety of people on board.

The resolution also notes the need for the humane
treatment of migrants, including asylum-seekers,
respecting their dignity and fully upholding their rights.
We welcome the resolution's provision of a monitoring
mechanism for the measures implemented, including in
the form of reports of the Secretary-General. We intend
to closely monitor all actions to be taken with regard to
vessels in that region.
