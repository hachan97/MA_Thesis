Ms. Wronecka (Poland): Poland welcomes the
adoption of resolution 2471 (2019), renewing the
sanctions regime on South Sudan for another year. We
regret that the Council was unable to reach consensus
on it, however. We would like to thank the United
States for its efficient conduct of the negotiations on
the document.

As Chair of the Committee established pursuant
to resolution 2206 (2015) concerning South Sudan, we
support the resolution because we believe that at this
stage it is important to maintain the sanctions regime.
Although we welcome the steps taken by the South
Sudanese parties, we are still not in a position to say
that we are seeing tangible results of the peace process
in South Sudan, including the implementation of the
fundamental provisions of the Revitalized Agreement
on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of
South Sudan. What we can see, however, is a significant
reduction of violence across the country, especially
violence against civilians, which we believe is a direct
effect of the arms embargo.

Nevertheless, South Sudan continues to experience
a major protection crisis. The pervasive culture
of violence continues in a context of impunity.
We stress the critical importance of effectively
implementing the sanctions regime and the key role
that the neighbouring States, as well as regional and
subregional organizations, can play in that regard.
We call on all parties to demonstrate good faith and
to implement the sanctions. We believe that it is the
Council's responsibility to continue to stem and control
the flow of arms into the territory of South Sudan, and
by doing so steadily reduce the violence and brutality
against innocent civilians. For that reason, and as we
did last year, Poland voted in favour of the resolution.
