The President (spoke in Spanish): To optimize
the use of our time, I will not individually invite
speakers to take seats at the Council table or invite
them to resume their seats at the side of the Chamber.
When a speaker is taking the floor, the Conference
Officer will seat the next speaker on the list at the
table.

The next speaker is the Acting Secretary General
of the Organization of American States, His Excellency
Mr. Luigi R. Einaudi, on whom I now call.
