The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General on the situation in Tajikistan,
documents S/l995/472, S/1995/472/Corr.1 and
S/l995/472/Add.1. Members of the Council also have
before them document S/ 1995/486, which contains the text
of a draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless
I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the
vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council who
Wish to make statements before the voting.
