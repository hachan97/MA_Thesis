Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I will be brief. Ijust
wanted to say, and should have said in my intervention,
that we share the American concerns on Xinjiang. On
humanitarian intervention, I do not think that it is a
topic for the Security Council today but we will be
happy to participate in discussions on that topic at a
different stage.
