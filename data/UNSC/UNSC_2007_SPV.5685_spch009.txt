Sir Emyr Jones Parry (United Kingdom): The
United Kingdom welcomes the adoption of resolution
1757 (2007). The proposed Tribunal is vital for
Lebanon, for justice and for the region. The
establishment of the Tribunal through Lebanese
internal procedures had been thwarted. The Council,
for its part, has been asked to adopt a binding decision
to create the Tribunal.

This is not a capricious intervention or
interference in the domestic political affairs of a
sovereign State. It is a considered response by the
Council, properly taken, to a request from the
Government of Lebanon for action to overcome a
continued impasse in Lebanon's internal procedures,
despite long and serious efforts to find a solution
within Lebanon.

It is a long-held United Kingdom view that, to
make this decision binding, it was necessary for such a
resolution, inter alia, to be taken under Chapter VII.
The use of Chapter VII carries no connotation other
than that it makes this resolution binding. That is why
the United Kingdom supported this resolution. We
hope that all parties in Lebanon will now be able to
move forward together to take the necessary decisions
to build upon this formal establishment of the Tribunal.
