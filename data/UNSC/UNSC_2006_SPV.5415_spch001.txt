The President (spoke in Chinese): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Uganda, in which he requests that
his delegation be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that delegation to
participate in the discussion without the right to vote,
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Sam Kutesa

took seats at the Council table.

The President (spoke in Chinese): On behalf of
the Council, I extend a warm welcome to the Minister
for Foreign Affairs of Uganda, His Excellency Mr. Sam
Kutesa, and to the Minister of Defence of Uganda, His
Excellency Mr. Amama Mbabazi.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.
