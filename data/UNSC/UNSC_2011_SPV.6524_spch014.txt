Mr. Salam (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): I should
like to start by thanking Mr. Pascoe for his briefing.

I recall that the links between Lebanon and Syria
transcend those of mere good-neighbourliness. That is
why the Taif Agreement, which is the foundation of
Lebanon's Constitution, stipulates that Lebanon, Arab
in its identity, is linked by sincere fraternal relations
with all Arab States and has special relations with Syria
that draw their strength from history and common
fraternal interests. Coordination and cooperation
between the two countries are based on those
principles.

The security of Lebanon is bound up with that of
Syria, and vice versa. What takes place in Lebanon
affects Syria, and what takes place in Syria affects
Lebanon. History has demonstrated that fact most
convincingly. In referring to developments in Syria,
President of the Republic Michel Sleiman expressed
very clearly that

"Lebanon supports stability in Syria and the
wider Arab world, but most especially in Syria
because the security of both countries is linked.
Lebanon also supports Syria's leadership in its
decision to initiate reforms, including the lifting
of the state of emergency and the laws on
political parties and information. Lebanon also
recognizes the fact that the calls for reform are
correct and justified and not intended to foment
sectarian rivalries and strife."

Today, more than ever, the hearts and minds of all
Lebanese people stand in support of Syria's sovereignty
and territorial integrity, its people and the safety and
security of its children. In Lebanon, we know better
than anyone else how central Syria's role has been
throughout history. We regret the deaths of the victims.
We extend our condolences to their families and hope
that Syria will enjoy peace and progress.
