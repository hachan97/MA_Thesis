Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
voted in favour of newly adopted resolution 2241 (2015)
on adjusting the mandate ofthe United Nations Mission
in South Sudan (UNMISS). Under the active facilitation
efforts on the part of the Intergovernmental Authority on
Development (IGAD) and other international partners,
parties to the conflict in South Sudan formally signed
the agreement on resolving the conflict in South Sudan.
The peace process in South Sudan has therefore entered
a new stage. China welcomes that development. We
appreciate the tremendous efforts undertaken by the
African Union (AU) and IGAD in that regard.

It is China's hope that resolution 2241 (2015)
will play a vigorous and constructive role in moving
South Sudan towards the early achievement of peace
and stability. The current imperative is to support the
efforts of the AU and IGAD, urge all South Sudanese
parties to honour their ceasefire commitments in an
effective manner and comprehensively implement the
provisions of the agreement on schedule, firmly support
the role of IGAD as the main conduit of good offices
and actively provide assistance to IGAD in monitoring
the implementation of the agreement.

On the question of sanctions, China has always
maintained that the Security Council should exercise
caution. The Council's actions on South Sudan should
consider the broader picture of the peace process
in South Sudan and facilitate the implementation
of the Agreement by all parties and the prevention
of confrontation and conflict. China notes that the
concerns of certain members of the Council with regard
to the draft resolution have not been completely met.
We believe that the Security Council should have spent
more time on broad consultations so as to maximize
efforts to seek a consensus, maintain the unity of the
Council and ensure the successful implementation of
the resolution.
