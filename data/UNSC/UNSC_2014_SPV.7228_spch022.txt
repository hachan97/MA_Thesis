The President: I wish to remind all speakers to
limit their statements to no more than four minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate their texts in writing and
to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.

I give the floor to the Minister of State for Foreign
Affairs and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister of
Pakistan.
