Mr. Ndong Mba (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in Spanish): The Republic of Equatorial Guinea is
generally opposed to sanctions when they do not have
a clearl and well-defined goal to improve or help to
resolve the prevailing situation in the affected country
or region. In the case at hand, bearing in mind not only
the atrocious effects of the criminality in Libya, but
also the fact that all of this is impacting West Africa
and Central Africa, we believe that these sanctions
could help to attenuate these effects.

On the other hand, we tend to forget the fact that
it is women who most suffer in situations like that

prevailing in Libya, characterized by human trafficking,
sexual violence, the abuse of immigrants, illegal arms
trafficking and the illicit trade of crude oil on the black
market, all of which simply prolongs the suffering and
need of the Libyan people. We believe and hope that
the renewal of the sanctions through resolution 2441
(2018), which we have just adopted, will contribute, as I
said, to pacifying the situation in that brotherly country
of North Africa, Libya.

The meeting rose at 10.25 a.m.
