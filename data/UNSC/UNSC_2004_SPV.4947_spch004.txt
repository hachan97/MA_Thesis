Mr. Thomson (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom is naturally disappointed that the Council was
not able to reach consensus on our draft resolution. I
nevertheless thank Council members for their efforts
over the past three days to try to achieve a consensus
decision.

No one is opposing the general substance of this
draft resolution. One member of the Council has voted
against it for technical reasons of procedure and
timing. Our purpose in this draft resolution is to
support the efforts of the Secretary-General and his
team and to support the Secretary-General's plan for a
comprehensive settlement on the island of Cyprus.

The fact that the overwhelming majority of the
Council has voted in favour sends a strong message of
support for the Secretary-General's efforts and for the
Secretary-General's plan, which offers the Cypriot
people a historic opportunity to find a peaceful solution
to the conflict in Cyprus. We very much hope that they
will seize it. This vote also offers the people of Cyprus
reassurance that the Council will act on the obligations
foreseen for it in the comprehensive settlement,
including the establishment of a strengthened United
Nations peacekeeping operation and the imposition of
an arms embargo. There should be no doubt, therefore,
that the Council stands ready to fulfil its commitments.

Our draft resolution remains on the table, and we
will ask for the Council to take speedy action after the
referendums.
