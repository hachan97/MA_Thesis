The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Lebanon, in which she requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite the representative of Lebanon to participate in
the consideration of the item without the right to vote,
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Ms. Ziade
(Lebanon) took a seat at the Council table.

The President (spoke in Arabic): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

I wish to draw the attention of members to
document 8/2006/933, which contains the text of a
letter dated 1 December 2006 from the Secretary-
General addressed to the President of the Security
Council.

Following consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council recalls all its
previous resolutions on Lebanon, in particular
resolutions 1701 (2006), 425 (1978), 426 (1978),
520 (1982), 1559 (2004) and 1680 (2006), as well
as the statements of its President on the situation
in Lebanon, in particular the statements of
30 October 2006 (S/PRST/2006/43) and of
21 November 2006 (S/PRST/2006/46).
"The Security Council reiterates its full
support for the legitimate and democratically
elected Government of Lebanon, calls for full
respect for the democratic institutions of the
country, in conformity with the constitution, and
condemns any effort to destabilize Lebanon. The
Security Council calls upon all Lebanese political
parties to show responsibility with a View to
preventing, through dialogue, further
deterioration of the situation in Lebanon. It
reaffirms its strong support for the sovereignty,
territorial integrity, unity and political
independence of Lebanon within its
internationally recognized borders and under the
sole and exclusive authority of the Government
of Lebanon. The Council reiterates its call upon
all parties concerned to cooperate fully and
urgently with the Security Council for the full
implementation of all relevant resolutions
concerning the restoration of the territorial
integrity, full sovereignty and political
independence of Lebanon.

"The Security Council welcomes the letter
of the Secretary-General to the President of the
Council of 1 December 2006 (S/2006/933), as
well as his previous reports of 18 August 2006
(S/2006/670) and of 12 September 2006
(S/2006/730) on the implementation of resolution
1701 (2006).

"The Security Council calls for the full
implementation of resolution 1701 (2006) and
urges all concerned parties to cooperate fully with
the Security Council and the Secretary-General to
achieve this goal.

"The Security Council welcomes the
Secretary-General's indication of the continuing
commitment of the Government of Lebanon and
the Government of Israel to all aspects of the
implementation of resolution 1701 (2006). It
urges both Governments to strictly abide by their
commitment and to pursue their efforts to achieve
a permanent ceasefire and a long-term solution as
envisioned in the resolution.

"The Security Council notes that important
progress has been made towards the
implementation of resolution 1701 (2006), in
particular through the cessation of hostilities, the
imminent withdrawal of all the Israeli forces from
06-65528
southern Lebanon and the deployment of the
Lebanese Armed Forces in the south of the
country for the first time in three decades,
together with the deployment so far of more than
10,000 troops from the reinforced UNIFIL.

"The Security Council welcomes the
maintenance of the cessation of hostilities since
14 August 2006, supports the work done by
UNIFIL, together with the parties, to finalize the
Israeli withdrawal from the remaining area inside
Lebanon and set up temporary security
arrangements for the part of the village of Ghajar
inside Lebanese territory, positively notes the
decision of the Israeli Cabinet in this regard, and
looks forward to its early implementation.

"The Security Council commends the
Lebanese Government for extending its authority
throughout its territory, particularly in the south,
and encourages it to continue its efforts in this
regard, including through the reinforcement of its
capacities along its borders and the exercise of its
monopoly of the use of force all over its territory
in accordance with relevant Security Council
resolutions.

"The Security Council reiterates its full
support to UNIFIL and looks forward to the
completion of its deployment early next year as
contemplated by the Secretary-General in his
letter. It expresses its strong appreciation to
Member States who have contributed to UNIFIL
in the past and since the adoption of resolution
1701 (2006) and notes the establishment of the
Strategic Military Cell dedicated to UNIFIL at
United Nations Headquarters.

"The Security Council, while expressing
deep concern at the continuing Israeli violations
of Lebanese airspace, appeals to all parties
concerned to respect the cessation of hostilities
and the Blue Line in its entirety, to refrain from
any act of provocation and to abide scrupulously
by their obligation to respect the safety of the
UNIFIL and other United Nations personnel,
including by avoiding any course of action which
endangers United Nations personnel and by
ensuring UNIFIL is accorded full freedom of
movement throughout its area of operation.

"The Security Council, in this context,
reiterates its deep concern at latest reports,
though unverified, of illegal movements of arms
into Lebanon. It welcomes the initial steps taken
by the Government of Lebanon, notably the
deployment of 8,000 troops along the border, to
prevent movements of arms, in conformity with
relevant resolutions, and reiterates its call upon
the Government of Syria to take similar measures
to reinforce controls at the border.

"The Security Council, mindful of the
conclusions of the team of border police experts
dispatched by the Secretary-General at the
request of the Government of Lebanon, invites
the Secretary-General to pursue further technical
and independent assessment of the situation along
the border and to report back to the Council on
further findings and recommendations in this
regard.

"The Council further invites Member States,
as recommended by the Secretary-General, to
consider possible bilateral assistance to the
Government of Lebanon to enhance its border
security capacities.

"The Council urges all Member States, in
particular in the region, to take all necessary
measures to implement in full paragraph 15 of
resolution 1701 (2006), including the arms
embargo, and expresses its intention to consider
further steps to achieve the goals set out in that
paragraph.

"The Security Council welcomes the
concrete steps taken by the Government of
Lebanon, with the assistance of UNIFIL, to
establish between the Blue Line and the Litani
river an area free of any armed personnel, assets
and weapons other than those of the Government
of Lebanon and of UNIFIL and calls upon the
Government of Lebanon to strengthen its efforts
to this end. The Council also reiterates its call for
the disbanding and disarmament of all militias
and armed groups in Lebanon.

"The Security Council expresses deepest
concern at the presence in very high numbers of
unexploded ordnance in south Lebanon, including
cluster munitions. It deplores the death and injury
of dozens of civilians, as well as of several
deminers, caused by those munitions since the
cessation of hostilities. It welcomes the continued
contribution of UNIFIL to operational mine
clearance, encourages further assistance in mine
action by the United Nations to the Government
of Lebanon in support of both the continued
development of its national mine action capacity
and clearance of the remaining mine/unexploded
ordnance threat in the South, commends donor
countries for supporting these efforts through
financial and in-kind contributions and
encourages further international contributions and
practical cooperation.

"The Security Council reaffirms the urgent
need for the unconditional release of the abducted
Israeli soldiers.

"The Security Council further encourages
efforts aimed at urgently settling the issue of the
Lebanese prisoners detained in Israel.

"The Security Council commends the
efforts of the Secretary-General and his facilitator
to this end and calls upon all parties concerned to
support those efforts.

"Bearing in mind the relevant provisions of
resolutions 1559 (2004), 1680 (2006) and 1701
(2006), in particular on the delineation of the
Syrian-Lebanese border, the Security Council
takes note with interest of the appointment by the
Secretary-General of a senior cartographer to
review relevant material and develop an accurate
territorial definition of the Shaba'a farms area.

"The Security Council notes with
appreciation the process launched by the
Secretary-General to investigate the cartographic,
legal and political implications of the proposal
the

contained in the seven-point plan of the
Government of Lebanon and looks forward to its
further recommendations on this issue early next
yean

"The Security Council calls upon the
international community urgently to provide the
Government of Lebanon with financial assistance
in support of the national early recovery and
reconstruction process. It expresses its
appreciation to the Member States, United
Nations bodies and intergovernmental, regional
and non-governmental organizations that have
provided and continue to provide assistance to the
Lebanese people and Government, and looks
forward to the success of the international
Conference which will be held in Paris, on 25
January 2007, in support of Lebanon.

"The Security Council reaffirms its full
support to the Secretary-General in his efforts and
dedication to facilitate and assist in the fulfilment
of all provisions of resolution 1701 (2006) and
requests the Secretary-General to report on a
quarterly basis on the implementation of that
resolution, notably on further progress made
towards the achievement of a permanent ceasefire
and a long-term solution."

This statement will be issued as a document of
Security Council under the symbol

S/PRST/2006/52.

The Security Council has thus concluded the

present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
