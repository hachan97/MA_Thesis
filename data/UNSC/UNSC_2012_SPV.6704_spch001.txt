The President: The Security Council Will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2012/41, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations.
I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2012/38, which contains a note by the
Secretary-General concerning the date of an election to
fill a vacancy in the International Court of Justice.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to adopt the draft resolution contained in document
S/2012/41 without a vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The draft resolution has been adopted as
resolution 2034 (2012).

The Security Council has thus concluded its
business for this meeting.

The meeting rose at 10.15 am.
