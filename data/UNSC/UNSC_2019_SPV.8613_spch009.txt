The President: Before I give the floor to Council
members, I should like to inform them that I will have
to leave in a little while to present the report of the
Security Council to the General Assembly (A/73/2). It is
the report we have agreed and approved. Mr. Safronkov
will steer the meeting in my absence.

(spoke in Russian)

I shall now give the floor to those Council members
who wish to make statements.
