Mr. Cardi (Italy): I would first like to thank the
delegation of Senegal for its work on the text of resolution
2337 (2017). We support taking rapid action on the
resolution, in the belief that the Council should make
its voice heard in these crucial hours for the country's
future and the stability of the region. We fully support
the preventive diplomatic efforts that the international
community, and especially The Gambia's neighbours,
have been engaged in. We also commend the mediation
by the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), the support of the African Union and the
role played by Mr. Chambas, Special Representative of
the Secretary-General for West Africa. All of that is
proof of African ownership and leadership on the issue.

The about-face of former President Jammeh on the
outcome of the presidential election, in which he was
defeated, is deplorable. Today, however, the countries
of West Africa and its subregional organizations are
walking steadily along the path of democracy and the
rule of law. At such a sensitive time, we would like to
reiterate the urgings - of ECOWAS, the United Nations
Office for West Africa and the Sahel, the African Union
and the Security Council in today's resolution - that
the Gambian army should respect the will of the people,
support a peaceful and democratic transition of power
to the new President and stand loyally by the side of
the country's elected authority. Today Mr. Adama
Barrow is the legitimate President of The Gambia. We
congratulate him on the swearing-in ceremony that just
took place and that we attended.
