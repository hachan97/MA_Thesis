Mr. Bakuramutsa (Rwanda) (interpretation from French): My delegation does not wish to engage in
polemics. It simply wants the Council to be prudent and
logical when it takes its decisions. There is no logic, I
believe, in establishing a commission to highlight
elements of impunity in the region while some members
of the Council or even countries in the region continue to
arm those very elements whose impunity we wish to
eliminate.

Thus, when we talk about eliminating impunity in
the region, I would like us to demonstrate consistency by
detaining those very criminals who enjoy that impunity
and whom we are sheltering, feeding and supporting in
our countries. That, I believe, is the logic of the situation.
How can the population of a region consider you to be
credible if you shelter and arm those criminals? What I
want is logic. This is extremely important.
