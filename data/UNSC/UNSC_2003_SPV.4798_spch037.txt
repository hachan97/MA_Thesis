Mr. Chandler (Chairman of the Monitoring Group): I would like to take this opportunity, first of
all, to thank all the members of the Council who have
given us support and recognition for the work we are
trying to undertake as our small but important
contribution, I think, towards the implementation of
resolution 1455 (2003). In particular, I would also like
to take this opportunity to ask States that, whenever we
request information, they do their utmost to try to
provide it to us as quickly as they can, in order to help
us with the assessment and the analysis that is required
in support of the 1267 Committee's work.

We are looking forward very much to the
forthcoming report from Member States. We believe,
from our knowledge of the activities of Al Qaeda
around the world, that the information that those
reports from States contain, particularly if they are
comprehensive and, as much as possible, follow the
guidelines put established by the 1267 Committee, will
enrich the final product - the report that we will
submit to the Committee towards the end of the year,
which in turn will enhance the quality of the report that
Ambassador Mufioz's Committee will make to the
Council in December in written form. Those are the
main areas that I would like to emphasize.

We also find that working with the Member
States that we visited - and continuing in that way -
has been extremely fruitful. Those countries that we
have Visited so far have gone out of their way to make
sure that we are given the information that we seek.

They have also been good enough to highlight areas of The Security Council has thus concluded the
concern that they have and problems and challenges present stage of its consideration of the item on its
that they are still facing. It is on that basis that We are agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the
able to give the sort of report that we have to the matter.
