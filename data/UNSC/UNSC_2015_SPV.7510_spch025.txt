Mr. Thaci (spoke in Albanian; interpretation provided by the delegation): I am sorry that this
platform is being misused for the purposes of political
propaganda and everyday political issues in Serbia.
Kosovo is a new, multi-ethnic country and a State
whose citizens are equal before the law. I am very sorry
that we are wasting the Security Council's time.

We could talk and debate for hours, but the facts
are clear and unalterable. In my opening remarks I
mentioned that there could be no document, even in
this institution, capable of containing all the crimes
and the genocide that Serbia committed in Kosovo. The
war is over. Kosovo is an independent and sovereign
country, now recognized by 111 States. It is a member
of major international mechanisms and organizations.
It is strengthening its international status and has built
excellent relations with all the countries in the region.
In the coming days we will sign a border demarcation
agreement with Montenegro. We have fostered very
good neighbourly relations with a view to ensuring
peace and stability in the region. We have also begun
to normalize relations between Serbia and Kosovo
on an equal footing. Despite all the difficulties in
implementing the agreements, the dialogue has been
successful. I do not wish to discuss history here, but let
me just say that Kosovo is now on a clear path towards
progress and Euro-Atlantic integration, including being
a part of NATO, the European Union and the United
Nations.
