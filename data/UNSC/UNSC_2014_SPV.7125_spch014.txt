Mr. Errazuriz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): We
express our deep concern over the serious escalation of
the crisis in Ukraine, which must be urgently reversed.
We call for the greatest restraint and moderation.

We would once again reiterate, as we have stressed
previously, the obligation to respect the sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, in
accordance with the provisions of the Charter of the
United Nations. Moreover, the parties involved must
refrain from taking actions in contravention of the
Charter of the United Nations and international law,
especially the use or threat of use of force.

The Budapest Memorandum is clear. It represents
a commitment to respecting the independence,
sovereignty and current borders of Ukraine and to
refraining from the use or threat of use of force against
the territorial integrity and political independence of
Ukraine. Those obligations must be complied with.

The international community must continue to
provide support to reach a peaceful solution to the crisis.
In this context, we support the efforts in support of
international mediation or other mechanisms, including
those that could be used by regional organizations to
help resolve the crisis. We welcome the decision of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
to send observers to the eastern part of Ukraine. Chile
supports the efforts of the Secretary-General, and we
welcome in particular the mission led by the Deputy
Secretary-General, Mr. Jan Eliasson, who is at this very
moment in Kyiv. We also call for the Russian Federation
to consider undertaking consultations in the framework
of the Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation in order to
find a solution to the present crisis.

I wish to conclude by stressing the fact that it is up
to the people of Ukraine to define their own destiny
in an inclusive process that guarantees the rule of law,
human rights, fundamental freedoms and respect for
the rights of minorities.
