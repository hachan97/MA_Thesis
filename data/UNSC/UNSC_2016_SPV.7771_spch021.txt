Mr. Saikal (Afghanistan): Ijust want to make two
brief points.

First, on behalf of my Government, I wish to
officially thank the Security Council for adopting the
very timely presidential statement S/PRST/2016/14,
expressing its unanimous support. Secondly, let me
thank the Foreign Minister of New Zealand, His
Excellency Mr. Murray McCully, for presiding over
today's meeting on Afghanistan. New Zealand is a
true-blue friend of Afghanistan, and I am sure that
it was in the spirit of such friendship that Minister
McCully spoke so frankly in his statement.

However, with all due respect, the debate
over governance in Kabul is an internal matter for
Afghanistan, and we expect our friends and partners
around the world to respect that and understand their
limitations when it comes to the sovereignty of other
countries, just as we respect the sovereignty of New
Zealand and all other countries around the world. The
debate in Kabul is for the sake of the political stability
of Afghanistan, of which our international partners
should be proud. We will have to address anything that
could harm the political stability of Afghanistan.

Our two national leaders at the head of the
Government proved themselves two years ago when,
after a very lengthy marathon election, they came
together and showed a great deal of statesmanship in
putting the National Unity Government together. Of
course, as we said from the start, this has not been an
easy way; there is a troubled way ahead of us, but we
must make it work. And the only way to make it work
is to address the issues rather than ignore them. That is
exactly what we are doing.
