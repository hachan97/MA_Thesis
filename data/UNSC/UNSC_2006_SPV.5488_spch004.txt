Ms. Loj (Denmark): Regrettably, Denmark was
not in a position to vote in favour of the draft
resolution just considered. The draft resolution
addresses issues of great concern to my Government,
and, if it had included a more thorough recognition of
the complexities on the ground, my delegation would
have liked to vote in favour of the draft resolution.

Denmark is very concerned about the situation in
the Middle East, which has further deteriorated over
the past few days. In particular, Denmark is seriously
concerned at the loss of civilian life caused by the
escalating military operation and its consequences,
including the deterioration of the humanitarian
condition of the population in Gaza. We therefore call
on both parties to alleviate the desperate humanitarian
situation of the civilian population.

Moreover, my Government continues to urge both
parties to abstain from any action that violates
international law and on Israel to exercise utmost
restraint and to avoid disproportionate action. Denmark
continues to be concerned about the detention of
elected members of the Palestinian Government and
legislature and calls for their immediate release. Those
detained should be accorded their full legal rights in
accordance with international law.

Denmark continues to call on the Palestinian
leadership to bring an end to violence and terrorist
activities, including the firing of rockets into Israeli
territory.

The abducted Israeli soldier should be released
immediately and unconditionally.

Recent developments, including in relations
between Israel and Lebanon - which we will be
discussing tomorrow - underline more than ever that
political negotiations are the only way to achieve a just
and lasting settlement. Both parties must urgently
demonstrate an active commitment to the search for a
negotiated two-State solution and respect existing
agreements and obligations.
