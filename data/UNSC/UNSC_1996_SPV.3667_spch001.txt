The President (interpretation from Chinese): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Algeria, Djibouti, Ghana, Liberia,
Nigeria, Zambia and Zimbabwe in which they request to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Bull (Liberia)
took a seat at the Council table; Mr. Lamamra
(Algeria), Mr. Olhaye (Djibouti), Mr. Wilmot (Ghana),
Mr. Gambari (Nigeria), Mr. Kasanda (Zambia) and
Mr. Mapuranga (Zimbabwe) took the seats reserved
for them at the side of the Council Chamber.

The President (interpretation from Chinese): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
seventeenth progress report of the Secretary-General on the
United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia, document
S/ 1996/362.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to the following other documents: S/ 1996/353,
letter dated 15 May 1996 from the Charge d'affaires ad
interim of the Permanent Mission of Italy to the United
Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, transmitting the
text of a declaration by the European Union on Liberia's
boat people; and S/1996/377, letter dated 17 May 1996
from the Permanent Representative of Ghana to the United
Nations addressed to the Secretary-General.

 
The first speaker is the representative of Liberia, on
whom I now call.
