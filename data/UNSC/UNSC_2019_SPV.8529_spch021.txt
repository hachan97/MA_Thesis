Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I will be very brief, Mr. President. Today we
have witnessed an attempt to introduce censorship into
the Security Council. We do not consider that the way it
was done helps to maintain a businesslike atmosphere in
the Security Council. That is my first point. Secondly,
I have no illusions that I will succeed in changing the
views of my German colleague about who is complying
with the Minsk agreements and who is not. He will still
say that he sees things the way he sees them, which is
apparently through the prism of the hourglass, which
somewhat distorts his perspective, although it is true
that it is no longer in the Security Council Chamber.

I wanted to ask one question and make one
comment. It is a rhetorical question, because the answer
is obvious. I want to ask the Permanent Representative
of Germany where he saw any intimidation of President
Zelensky in our statement. Perhaps he did not listen to
us very carefully. On the contrary, we said that with
respect to the issue that we wanted to consider today,
President Zelensky had demonstrated good instincts,
and not merely good instincts but good sense, which

was completely absent in the preceding President.

Secondly, we have taken note of the view expressed
by several delegations to the effect that today's discussion
was not well timed, but that there is nothing to prevent
us from discussing the issue at an appropriate moment.
We reserve the right to return to this issue when the
Council feels that the time has come to discuss it. We
would like to think that the most appropriate time will
be when that law enters into force. We are grateful for
the suggestion.
