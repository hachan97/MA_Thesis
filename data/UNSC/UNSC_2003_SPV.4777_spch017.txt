Mr. Olson (United States of America): I will be
brief, because most of our remarks have been covered
by other members.

I would like to join other members in thanking
Under-Secretary-General Oshima for his detailed and
very sobering report, as well as for the hard work he
has done in the area of protecting civilians in armed
conflict throughout his tenure.

The United States has long believed that
safeguarding civilians from the devastating effects of
armed conflict is at the very heart of the United
Nations Charter. Indeed, the work presented here today
exemplifies the spirit of the Charter and the aspirations
of this Organization's founders to protect the innocent
and most vulnerable from violence of any kind,
whether at the hands of soldiers or terrorists. We are
confident that the information provided to us today will
prove useful to the Council in its future deliberations
when considering the protection of civilians in armed
conflict.

The general principles of providing humanitarian
access to vulnerable populations, the separation of
civilians and armed elements, the restoration of the rule
of law, justice and reconciliation are all fundamental to
the protection of civilians and fully supported by my
delegation and the others around this table. They are
important issues which we hope to continue to discuss
in the future.

My delegation fully supports the idea of further
developing the road map for the protection of civilians
and the implementation of many of the objectives it
calls for. We will work with other members in that
process to fully develop the road map. We reiterate our
support for the Secretary-General's efforts to protect
civilians in armed conflict and look forward to the next
briefing in six months, as well as to the completion of
the road map at that time.
