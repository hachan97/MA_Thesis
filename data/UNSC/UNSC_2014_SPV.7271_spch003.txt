briefing. We all thank the Secretary-General and
Special Representative Mladenov, whom we thank in
particular for all the work he is doing as the head of the

grateful.

The Council has before it the text of a statement
by the President on behalf of the Council. I thank
Council members for their valuable contributions to
this statement.

In accordance with the understanding reached
