The President: At the outset of the meeting, I should
like, on behalf of the Council, to express deep sorrow at the
passing, on 19 February 1997, of Deng Xiaoping,
Paramount Leader of China. Deng Xiaoping will be
remembered by the international community for his
dedicated contribution to global peace, security and
development, and for his role as the primary architect of
China's reforms, its opening up, modernization and
unprecedented economic development. His passing is a
great loss to China and to the international community.

On behalf of the Council, I request the Permanent
Representative of China to convey to the Government and
people of China and to the bereaved family our profound
condolences.

I now invite members of the Council to rise and
observe a minute of silence in tribute to the memory of
Paramount Leader Deng Xiaoping.

The members of the Council observed a minute of
silence.
