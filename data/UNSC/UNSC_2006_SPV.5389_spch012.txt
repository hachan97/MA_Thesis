Mr. Burian (Slovakia): We are very pleased to
welcome President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf to the
Council. Slovakia would like to take this opportunity to
congratulate Liberia and its people on the successful
conclusion of the transitional process, and most
notably on the peaceful and democratic conduct of the
elections.

We applaud Liberia's progress in recent months.
The country, which was perceived as one of the world's
most fragile and vulnerable just a few moths ago, is
today being praised as an example of a successful
transition.

However, we want to underline the fact that
democratic elections are just the first step, though
extremely important. To make the positive
developments sustainable and stable, further decisions
and measures to strengthen democratic institutions and
good governance are needed. The major challenges
were very clearly described in President Johnson-
Sirleaf's statement and we have been impressed indeed
by her courage and resolution during the first weeks of
her presidency to implement important steps to further
the process of stabilization and reconciliation in
Liberia.

Slovakia considers ending impunity to be a major
challenge and imperative in all conflicts. We believe
that surrendering Mr. Charles Taylor to the Special
Court for Sierra Leone would be a major step for
Liberia on its way towards lasting peace and national
reconciliation. In that context, Slovakia welcomes the
announcement of the beginning of discussions between
the Governments of Liberia and Nigeria that could
bring the issue of Mr. Charles Taylor to a timely
resolution.

In conclusion, for our part, we would like to
express our full support for Liberia on its new way
towards stability, security and prosperity. We believe
Liberia will continue to be a much-needed good
example in the extremely volatile region of West
Africa. Slovakia is ready to support the legitimate
expectations of that country here in the Security
Council, as well as in other international forums.
