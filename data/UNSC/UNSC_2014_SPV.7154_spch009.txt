Mr. Gasana (Rwanda): I thank you, Madam
President, for convening this emergency meeting on the
situation in Ukraine. I also thank Assistant Secretary-
General Oscar Fernandez-Taranco for his briefing on
the worrying situation in eastern Ukraine.

We are very alarmed by reports of increased
tensions in eastern Ukraine in the past several days.
We condemn the attack that killed a State security
officer and wounded five others in the eastern city of
Slovyansk. The perpetrators of that criminal act should
be brought to justice. I take this opportunity to echo the
Secretary-General's call to all sides to work towards
calming the situation.

After numerous calls for the de-escalation of the
crisis, the situation has become more complex for
the diverse Ukrainian community. It is imperative to
protect the rights of the citizens of Ukraine regardless
of ethnic background. We reiterate our call for an
inclusive dialogue, a frank and open discussion that is
mutually beneficial for all the parties concerned.

Although Rwanda agrees in principle that Ukraine,
like any other country, has a right to self-defence
and to promote its territorial integrity, its acts should
be proportional. We discourage any military act that
would put the lives of innocent civilians in danger.

Rwanda remains of the View that military action
will only worsen the already tense situation. We
encourage all the parties involved, particularly in the
current situation, to exercise full restraint. It is vital
to allow the diplomatic efforts that have already been
deployed to work. The international community cannot
watch another crisis slip out of its hands. We must act on
what we stand for - peace and security. We welcome
the discussion among the United States, Ukraine and
Russia due to take place on 17 April. We encourage
United Nations participation in those talks.

In conclusion, let me reiterate that the Security
Council, the only world body in charge of maintaining
international peace and security, must work towards
restoring its own unity in order to be able to defend the
unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of a States
Members of the United Nations, while addressing the
interests of the countries of the region. We recognize
that there are political interests involved. However, we
should not forget that ordinary Ukrainians are caught
in the midst of this conflict; all they want and ask for
is a peaceful country. This we should all be mindful of.
