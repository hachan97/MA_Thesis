The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Cuba, Egypt and Jordan, in which
they request to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the discussion without the right to
vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Rodriguez
Parrilla (Cuba), Mr. Aboulgheit (Egypt) and Mr.
Al-Hussein (Jordan) took the seats reserved for
them at the side of the Council Chamber.

The President: The next speaker inscribed on my
list is the representative of Egypt. I invite him to take
seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
