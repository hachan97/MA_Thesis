Mr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian):
I am speaking a second time to make one clarification.
Ambassador Greenstock described a situation that has
arisen in the negotiations of the five countries, and he made
an appraisal of the status of these negotiations. I simply
would like to say that Ambassador Greenstock made the
appraisal on his own behalf and not on behalf of the five
countries he mentioned.

I would like to reiterate that there can be no artificial
timetable or temporary limitations. If we were to talk about
real compliance with the existing resolutions of the Security
Council, in such a way that they would be complied with
also by the members of the Security Council, then I think
we would quickly be able to reach an agreement. But here,
to a great extent, politics are involved, and we believe that
it is wrong for an improvement in the humanitarian
situation in Iraq to be held hostage to politics.

As for the Russian Federation, we are prepared to do
our utmost to speed up an agreement on a genuinely,
wholly acceptable text for a draft resolution. I would like
to recall, for those who at this point are in a hurry, that in
April of this year, Russia submitted a draft resolution
proposing that the results of the work of the three panels
headed by Ambassador Amorim be approved.
