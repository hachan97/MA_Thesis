Mr. Wang Yingfan (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
Chinese delegation would like to thank the Secretary-
General for his report on the United Nations Mission in
Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH), and to thank
Mr. Annabi for his briefing.

We have noted that UNMIBH has done some useful
work since the end of last year in assisting police
restructuring and the review of the judicial system. In
particular, progress has been made in establishing a multi-
ethnic police force, which is commendable. We hope that
UNMIBH will continue its work. If we are successful in
establishing a multi-ethnic police force in Bosnia, it will
provide lessons from which other United Nations
peacekeeping operations can learn.

We have also noted that problems remain in Bosnia.
National reconciliation still faces many obstacles and
difficulties. There are incidents of blackmail and other
crimes, political interference and corruption among the
ethnic groups. Resolving these problems will require the
continued efforts of the various parties in Bosnia and the
international community, and UNMIBH in particular.

The Secretary-General made it clear in his report
that UNMIBH needs support from the Security Council,
as well as from Member States with influence on the
Bosnian Croat and Bosnian Serb authorities, so as to help
it carry out its work. This recommendation by the
Secretary-General warrants our attention.
