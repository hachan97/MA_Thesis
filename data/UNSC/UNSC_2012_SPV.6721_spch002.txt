Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): The
United Kingdom is pleased to have co-sponsored
resolution 2037 (2012). As we made clear in our
statement to the Council yesterday, we commend the
development of the Joint Transition Plan by the
Government of Timor-Leste and the United Nations
Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) and
believe that it can set a standard for future
peacekeeping to peacebuilding transitions.

We encourage the United Nations and host States
to work together to produce comprehensive, detailed
plans for safeguarding the future stability of a country
supported by the Security Council.

We are confident that the United Nations and the
Government of Timor-Leste will continue the
cooperation they enjoyed in the development of the
Joint Transition Plan to present a clear proposal for the
shape, concept and objectives of the post-UNMIT
United Nations presence.

This is a landmark opportunity for the Security
Council to reshape the United Nations presence in a
way that can support Timorese efforts to sustain the
peace and to tackle Timor-Leste's longer-term
peacebuilding challenges. We are committed to
ensuring that the views of the Timorese Government
and people are taken into account during this period of
transition.

At the same time, we are clear that nothing in
paragraph 21 of this resolution can be read as limiting
or qualifying the role or decision-making authority of
the Council in determining the mandate and
configuration of United Nations missions.
