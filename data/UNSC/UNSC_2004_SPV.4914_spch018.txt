The President (spoke in Chinese): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of China.

The Chinese delegation would like to thank the
Ambassadors of the United States and the United
Kingdom for their briefings on behalf of the Coalition
Provisional Authority. We welcome the United Nations
team going to Iraq and carrying out a fact-finding
mission and we welcome the detailed report they have
submitted. We highly appreciate the efforts made by
Mr. Brahimi and his team.

China sincerely hopes that Iraq can smoothly
restore its sovereignty and independence and realize as
soon as possible peace, democracy and development.
Currently, the Iraqi situation has entered a new and
crucial stage. The political process is both dynamic and
faced with challenges.

We support the United Nations continuing to play
an important role. We take note of the
recommendations submitted to us in the report of the
team. At the same time, we hope that a general
consensus can be forged as soon as possible among all
Iraqis on the questions such as transitional mechanisms
and electoral arrangements. The international
community should maintain its unity in a joint
endeavour to create conditions conducive to all these
efforts.

I originally intended to raise a number of
questions. However, in view of the fact that the
questions raised by other members of the Council are
more or less similar to what I intended to raise, I will
not repeat all those questions.

I now resume my function as President of the
Council.

I now give the floor to Ambassador Jones Parry
to respond to comments and questions.
