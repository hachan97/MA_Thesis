Mr. Ciss (Senegal) (spoke in French): One year
ago, on 11 May 2016, the Security Council, under the
Egyptian presidency, held an open debate on the issue
of countering the narratives and ideologies of terrorism
(see S/PV.7690). Last month the Counter-Terrorism
Committee, in line with the presidential statement
(S/PRST/2016/6) adopted following that debate,
approved a comprehensive international framework
aimed at combating the narratives and ideologies of
terrorism, which was welcomed by the delegation of
Senegal.

It is only natural, then, for me to thank the
delegation of Egypt for having submitted to the
Council a draft on the very same issue, which we have
just adopted unanimously as resolution 2354 (2017).
Indeed, this resolution concerns a topic that is vital to
the maintenance of international peace and security.
Senegal joined the consensus and was a sponsor of the
draft.

However, given the importance and sensitive
nature of the issue, as well as the crucial need to take
into account national and regional specificities, the
Senegalese delegation would have preferred a more
inclusive negotiation process. That being said, now that
the resolution has been adopted, Senegal would like
to see its effective implementation, as my country is
part of a region facing the spread of violent extremism,
which, as we all are aware, is fuelled by the proliferation
of fundamentalist groups that promote radicalization.

These groups' strategies for the dissemination of
their violent ideologies are based on an improper, even
fallacious, interpretation of religion and instrumentalize
it for very different purposes. We should therefore take
the appropriate preventive measures to counter this
violent extremism based on religion and its corollary,
international terrorism. Thus resolution 2354 (2017),
adopted unanimously, is an important step in that
direction.
