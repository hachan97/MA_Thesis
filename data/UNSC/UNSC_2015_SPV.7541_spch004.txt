Mr. Van Bohemen (New Zealand): We welcome
the adoption of resolution 2244 (2015). We particularly
welcome the fact that it includes a specific provision to
reinforce Somalia's ability to exercise sovereignty over
its natural resources. Disputes between illegal fishing
vessels, local fishermen and armed groups concerning
the illegal exploitation of Somalia's natural resources
run the risk of becoming a driver of conflict.

Somalia's concern about its ability to control
access to its resources is not unique. The governance
and exploitation of natural resources and the challenge
posed by illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing
was also identified by many Member States during the
open debate (see S/PV.7499) held in July on peace and
security issues facing small island developing States.

On Eritrea, New Zealand recognizes that there are
important issues to address with regard to the scope and
focus of the sanctions regime in the light of the last two
reports (S/2015/802 and S/2014/727) of the Monitoring
Group. We hope that an improved relationship,
including on access between the Government of Eritrea
and the Monitoring Group, may enable the Council
to take clear decisions in future to determine if the
original purpose for which the sanctions were imposed
continues to apply.
