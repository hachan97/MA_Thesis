Mr. Ndong Mangue (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in Spanish): This morning the Security Council has
just adopted resolution 2498 (2019), by which it renews
the sanctions on Somalia. My delegation supports the
Panel of Experts on Somalia and welcomes its hard
work in helping to improve the security situation in
Somalia and the Horn of Africa. We encourage it to
do its utmost to always work in coordination with the
Somali authorities.
However, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea
abstained in the voting on the resolution, since we believe
that the negotiating process that led to its adoption was
not sufficiently extensive to take into account certain
important considerations that our delegation shared
with some members. Our request sought to achieve a
balanced text that reflected the various proposals and
was in line with the current political situation in the
Horn of Africa. We would have liked that issues not
directly related to the resolution not be mentioned in it.
