Mr. Bessho (Japan): I thank the United States
presidency for convening this meeting. I also thank
Under-Secretary-General Kim Won-soo for his briefing.

Japan is seriously concerned by continued reports
of the alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria,
including most recently in Idlib, which reportedly led
to the tragedy affecting more than 400 victims. The use
of chemical weapons is not permissible and must be
strongly condemned under any circumstances, and those
who are responsible for their use must be identified and
held accountable. I believe that there is unity inside the
Security Council on those fundamental points.

In addressing the new allegations in Syria, we must
first determine whether chemical weapons were actually
used, and, secondly, if confirmed, we must identify
those who are responsible. Taking measures to hold the
perpetrators accountable is the final and indispensable
step in fulfilling the Council's responsibility. Impunity
is unacceptable.

In that context, Japan welcomes the fact that the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
(OPCW) Fact-finding Mission in the Syrian Arab
Republic has already begun gathering information. We
urge the Syrian Government and all parties in Syria to
cooperate fully with the Fact-finding Mission and the
Mission itself to conclude its investigations, not only
in connection with the Idlib incident, but also with
other recent allegations as soon as possible, so that the
OPCW-United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism
can conduct its own investigation in order to identify
those responsible.

With that in mind, it is increasingly important
to further improve the coordination between the two
mechanisms and the Council so that we can react more
swiftly to any alleged use of chemical weapons. If we
are to dissuade potential actors from using them, it is
crucial to show that any such use will be brought to light
and that those responsible will be held accountable.
