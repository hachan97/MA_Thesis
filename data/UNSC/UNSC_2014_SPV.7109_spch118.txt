The President: I would like to thank all delegations
for their cooperation and understanding, given the
very impressive list of speakers. We had close to 70
delegations make statements, but we have managed to
finish perfectly on time, or at least finish the main part
of our debate.

I also understand that several delegations have
requested the floor to make further statements. It is my
intention to accept those requests. However, I would
kindly encourage each delegation to limit itself to one
additional statement.

I shall now give the floor to the member of the
Security Council who wishes to make a further
statement.
