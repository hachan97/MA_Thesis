Mr. Bermudez (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish):
Uruguay wishes to take this opportunity to reiterate its
concern about repeated missile launches by North Korea
and the increased tensions on the Korean peninsula.
Such actions constitute a serious threat to international
peace and security and are a clear violation of Security
Council resolutions.

Uruguay voted in favour of resolution 2356
(2017) because it believes that sanctions are a tool
that the Security Council can use in order to perform
its functions. However, sanctions are not an end unto
themselves; rather, they are a tool for achieving a
political goal, in this case the denuclearization ofNorth
Korea. In the same way, the commitment and firm
determination of Member States to complying with
their obligations and ensuring the correct and effective
implementation of sanctions is needed, while avoiding
adverse humanitarian consequences on the population
of North Korea.

Uruguay stresses the need to work towards defusing
tensions on the Korean peninsula and beyond. North
Korea must respect all Security Council resolutions
and desist from its nuclear ambitions. That would
help to create a peaceful environment and a return to
the path of dialogue, with the ultimate objective of
achieving denuclearization.

From the Security Council, Uruguay will continue
to fight along with the other 14 members to develop new
lines of action and try new approaches to, or modalities
of, negotiation in order to unlock this situation. Uruguay
reaffirms its commitment to achieving a peaceful,
political and diplomatic solution for denuclearizing the
Korean peninsula - one that will sweep away the risk of
a conflict of undesirable and unpredictable proportions.
