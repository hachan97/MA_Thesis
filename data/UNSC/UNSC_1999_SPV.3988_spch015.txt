Mr. Petrella (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): The
attacks by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) against Serb targets, which are taking place at
this moment, are a source of great concern for Argentina.

Since the peaceful settlement of disputes is one of
the guiding principles of our foreign policy, we regret that

 

the intransigence of the Belgrade Government has led to
this result, which no member of this Council desires.

Argentina reiterates its position regarding the urgent
need for strict compliance with Security Council resolutions
1160 (1998) and 1199 (1998), in which the humanitarian
abuses in Kosovo were condemned.

Yesterday the Government of Argentina issued a
communique in which it emphasized the need to create
conditions conducive to a lasting peace, within a framework
based on respect for human rights and for the principles of
the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, as well as greater autonomy for
Kosovo and protection of minorities.

We also wish to say that Argentina profoundly regrets
the suffering of the innocent civilian population and any
other victims that may result from this situation. But, as we
indicated at the beginning, the responsibility lies with the
Belgrade Government, since the objective of the military
action is to avert a humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo.

Lastly, we wish to make a sincere appeal to the
Belgrade Government to return to the path of negotiation.
