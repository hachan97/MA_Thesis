Mr. Moungara-Moussotsi (Gabon) (spoke in French):
We, too, would like to thank Ms. Del Ponte for the report
she has just made to the Council, and we encourage her in
her initiative to visit the former Yugoslavia and, soon,
Rwanda.

In our opinion, it is undeniable that the establishment
of the International Criminal Tribunals in order to deal with
serious Violations of human dignity represented the absolute
rejection of the culture of impunity in connection with any
kind of atrocities, wherever they may occur. The Violations
of human rights that occurred in the Balkans and in
Rwanda took place in deliberate defiance of the world's
conscience. Therefore, it is perfectly logical, proper and
legitimate that the international community, through the
Security Council, should have set up these two bodies.

Accordingly, my delegation believes that all States
have a duty to cooperate fully with the Tribunals without
seeking in any way whatsoever to influence the way they
operate. We would like to pay a well-deserved tribute to the
Stabilization Force for its work in the arresting of criminals,
and we thank those countries that have contributed to
investigations. For its part, my country, which appreciates
the two Tribunals' commendable work, will do its best to
cooperate fully.
In conclusion, I would be remiss if I did not wish
Ms. Del Ponte every success in her work.
