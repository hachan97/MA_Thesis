Mr. Power (United Kingdom): For the record,
then, the answer is that we should trust the information
from Russian intelligence about strikes on rebel-held
territory, but when the information is provided by
independent experts of the United Nations, we should
not trust it.

The meeting rose at 5.30 pm.
