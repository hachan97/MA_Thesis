Mr. Maquieira (Chile) (spoke in Spanish):
Following the Secretary-General's recommendation,
we voted in favour of a six-month extension of the
mandate of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in
Cyprus (UNFICYP). We await with interest the results
of the announced review of UNFICYP's mandate to be
carried out by the Secretary-General.

Finally, we call upon the parties to maintain their
commitment to the objective of reunification. We
believe that any measure that facilitates reunification
deserves our support. From that perspective, we
consider it valid to adopt measures to narrow the
development gap between the parties. Such measures
must conform to the provisions of Security Council
resolutions 541 (1983) and 550 (1984), and, as the
Secretary-General indicates in his report (S/2004/437),
they must not have the objective of recognizing
another State on Cyprus or of facilitating secession.
