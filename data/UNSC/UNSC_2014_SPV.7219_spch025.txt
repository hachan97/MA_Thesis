Mr. Percaya (Indonesia): I thank the President for
convening today's meeting.

As a matter of priority, on behalf of the Government
and the people of Indonesia, I wish to express our
deepest condolences to all affected nations, especially
our good neighbour Malaysia, over the deaths of the
298 civilian passengers and crew aboard Malaysia
Airlines Flight MH-17, which crashed yesterday as
it was flying over eastern Ukraine. As the Council
may be aware, 12 Indonesian citizens were confirmed
among the deceased. Our thoughts and prayers are with
the families of the victims. Allow me also to take this
opportunity to sincerely thank the delegations that have
expressed their sympathy and condolences to Indonesia.

According to various sources and reports, the
airplane was presumably shot down by a surface-to-air
missile. If that is indeed the case, such a heinous act
is tantamount to a grave violation of international law,
in particular international humanitarian law. In that
regard, Indonesia calls upon the Security Council to
take immediate steps to enable a thorough, transparent
and independent international investigation to be
conducted upon this horrendous incident.

Indonesia stands ready to join and support such
an investigation. If the investigation concludes that
the crash was indeed intentionally caused by human
factors, be it a missile strike or otherwise, Indonesia
demands that the perpetrators of such a heinous and
inhuman crime be brought to justice to the fullest
extent of the law.

As a precautionary measure, yesterday my President
instructed all Indonesian airlines to exercise the utmost
caution and to avoid the airspace in and around conflict
areas, including that of Ukraine.

In conclusion, as a member of the Association of
Southeast Ansian Nations family, Indonesia reiterates
its solidarity with the Government and the people of
Malaysia, as well as with the countries whose citizens
have fallen victim to this tragedy.
