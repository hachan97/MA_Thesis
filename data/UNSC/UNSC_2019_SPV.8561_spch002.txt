Mr. Delattre (France) (spoke in French): I would
like to speak on a point of order. France has not
objected to the participation of the Head of the Russian
Reconciliation Centre as a briefer in this meeting.
However, we want to point out that the monthly
humanitarian briefings are intended to give the
Security Council an opportunity to receive objective
information about the situation on the ground based
on information collected by impartial humanitarian
actors and United Nations agencies, as the Office for
the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs does every
month. The participation of civil society helps keep the
Council apprised of realities and difficulties that arise.
Despite the fact that it has been invited to speak under
rule 39, the Russian Reconciliation Centre is neither a
humanitarian actor nor a United Nations agency. It is
an entity of the Russian Ministry of Defence, which is
an active party to the conflict, and the information it
presents should be viewed in that light.
