Mr. Ja'afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): As a matter of fact, I am keen on Kuwait
more than my colleague the representative of Kuwait.
As I said, we are not levelling these accusations
against the Government of Kuwait. However, given
that the representative of Kuwait insists on denying
the credibility of what I said, this confirms that our
suspicions are true.

We must not protect terrorism, in accordance with
Council resolutions. We are not talking only for the
sake of talking. We have provided these names to the
relevant counter-terrorism subcommittees. We do what
we say. We are not simply basing these accusations
on articles from The New York Times, despite their
importance. If the Mutairi tribe of 2 million people
was all terrorists, then that would be a Kuwaiti disaster.
No. We are referring to one Al-Mutairi individual - a
staff sergeant in the Kuwaiti army - who is involved
in terrorist acts in my country. This is confirmed and
not just the talk of The New York Times. We have
provided the counter-terrorism subcommittees of the
Council with all the necessary evidence, but when we
asked to include Shafi Al-Ajmi on the list of terrorist
individuals, the delegation of Kuwait opposed it.
