The President (spoke in Chinese): I thank
Mr. Sharma for his clarifications and explanations,
which were very detailed. I think that they will help us
to gain a comprehensive picture of the situation in
Timor-Leste. I would also like to thank him for
providing us with the UNMISET web-site address; I
will certainly log on and visit it after the meeting.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 5 p.m.
