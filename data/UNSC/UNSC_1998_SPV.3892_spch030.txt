The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as representative of Portugal.

I would like to express Portugal's full support for the
draft resolution before the Council, which gives effect to
the recommendation contained in the report of the
Secretary-General with regard to the extension of the
mandate of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and
Herzegovina (UNMIBH) and the International Police Task
Force (IPTF).

Portugal shares the belief that the long-term
commitment of the international community to the peace
process in Bosnia must be reaffirmed through its continued
support of the peace implementation process by UNMIBH
and IPTF and continued security arrangements provided by
the Stabilization Force (SFOR).

On the other hand, this commitment must be matched
by Bosnians themselves, who must increasingly assume
responsibility for their future together in peace. Portugal
participates fully in UNMIBH, IPTF and SFOR, and stands
ready to continue to do so. My delegation, of course,
associates itself fully with the statement made by the United
Kingdom on behalf of the European Union.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

I shall now put to the vote the draft resolution
contained in document S/1998/502.

A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:
Bahrain, Brazil, China, Costa Rica, France, Gabon,
Gambia, Japan, Kenya, Portugal, Russian Federation,
Slovenia, Sweden, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland, United States of America
The President: There were 15 votes in favour. The
draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as

resolution 1174 (1998).

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 4.30 p.m.
