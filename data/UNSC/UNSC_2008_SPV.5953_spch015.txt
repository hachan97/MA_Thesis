Mr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): I thank Under-
Secretary-General Pascoe and Assistant Secretary-
General Mulet for their briefings. However, I take note
of the fact that, as they said, given the prevailing
situation it is difficult to gather information

We are concerned about the continued escalation
of the hostilities in the conflict zones in the context of
the Georgian-South Ossetian conflict, which has
resulted in numerous casualties among civilians and
peacekeepers as well as in massive destruction of
public and private property. We call upon all parties
concerned to exercise the utmost restraint, to strictly
observe the agreements that they have signed and to
return to negotiations with a view to finding a mutually
acceptable solution to the conflict, on the basis of
respect for and due consideration of one another's
legitimate interests. We strongly urge the parties
concerned to allow and facilitate humanitarian
activities to help the affected populations. Finally, we
continue to support international efforts to help resolve
the conflict.
