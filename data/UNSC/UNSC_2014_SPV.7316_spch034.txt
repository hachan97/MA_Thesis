The President: I thank the representative of the
United States for the leadership that his country is
showing in countering the threat of terrorism. I would
also like to convey Australia's deep condolences for
the barbaric murder of Peter Abdul-Rahman Kassig,
a brutal act that highlights the severe dangers that
humanitarian workers and other civilians are facing in
Syria at the hands of the Islamic State in Iraq and the
Levant.

I would like to thank all Council members for
their statements and contributions. I should inform all
concerned that we will carry on the open debate right
through the lunch hour, as we have a very large number
of speakers.

I now give the floor to the representative of India.
