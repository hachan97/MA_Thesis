The President: I thank Mr. Pascoe for his briefing.
I would also like to thank Mr. Pascoe for bringing to the
Council's attention the presence of Ms. Sable-Work
Zewde, the new Special Representative of the Secretary-
General and head of the United Nations Peacebuilding
Support Office in the Central African Republic. On
behalf of the Council, I wish to congratulate her on her
appointment and to convey our best wishes to her on
her assignment. The Council looks forward to working
with her.

I now give the floor to Mr. Jan Grauls.
