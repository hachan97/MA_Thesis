The President (spoke in French): I thank the
representative of Zambia for the kind words he
addressed to me.

The next speaker on my list is the Permanent
Observer of the African Union to the United Nations,
His Excellency Ambassador Amadou Kebe. I invite
him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his
statement.
