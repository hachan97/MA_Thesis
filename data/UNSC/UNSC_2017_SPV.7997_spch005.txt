Mr. Umarov (Kazakhstan): Kazakhstan voted
today in favour of resolution 2366 (2017), which
establishes the United Nations Verification Mission in
Colombia for an initial period of 12 months. This new
mission is designed to be the second political mission
in the country.

The unanimous adoption of the resolution
demonstrates the commitment and determination of
the Security Council to ensure the comprehensive
and sustained implementation of the historic peace
agreement reached between the Government of
Colombia and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias
de Colombia (FARC). We believe that, through its
transparency, monitoring and verification mechanism,
the United Nations Verification Mission in Colombia
will help the parties to attain the far-reaching political
and economic reforms agreed in the peace deal, including
the economic and social reintegration of former FARC
members into society. After successfully completing
the first stage of the peace process, which focused on
the completion of the disarmament process, Colombia
is now entering a new chapter of the peace agreement.

I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the
Colombian Government and our colleagues Ms. Holguin
Cue'llar, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Colombia and
Permanent Representative Mejia Velez, who are present
today with us, and most warmly commend efforts to
bring lasting peace to the country. Colombia indeed
sets a fine example of what can be achieved in other
conflict zones and areas of tension in the world when
there is a political commitment and the goodwill of all
sides to achieve common goals.
