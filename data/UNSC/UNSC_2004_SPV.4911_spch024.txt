Mr. Nkingiye (Burundi) (spoke in French):
Indeed, in the context of the political resolution of the
peace process in Burundi, a decision was taken and a
law was adopted to provide political amnesty to some
leaders. This decision was political only in scope: the
law clearly states that crimes of genocide and crimes
against humanity are not within its ambit. It also says
that the text remains open, and that national courts -
and international courts, once they are established -
must have every prerogative to conduct investigations
into any suspicious cases, and that any immunity
should be withdrawn when necessary. In other words,
this is not a law that provides de facto amnesty to those
who have committed horrendous crimes in Burundi.
