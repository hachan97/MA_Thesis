Mr. Gaspar Martins (Angola): I would like to
begin by thanking you, Mr. President, for organizing
this meeting on a key problem for the Security Council.

The introduction of targeted financial and travel
sanctions by the Security Council against individuals
involves a qualitative change in the Council's sanctions
policy, which we greatly welcome. We View the
Stockholm Process as a follow-up to an international
process dealing with targeted sanctions on the basis of
earlier work in the Interlaken, Bonn and Berlin
processes. There has indeed been progress in the work
on sanctions, as witnessed by the briefings given to the
Council this morning by Assistant Secretary-General
Tiirk and State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Dahlgren.
My delegation fully supports these kinds of initiatives.
We are pleased by those initiatives, and are most
sincerely thankful to the Governments of Sweden,
Germany and Switzerland for them.

My country, Angola, is an example of the
effectiveness of targeted sanctions. As Chairman of the
Ad Hoc Working Group on Conflict Prevention and
Resolution in Africa, we can greatly benefit from the
work of the sanctions Committee, since conflict
prevention and resolution in Africa can be greatly
enhanced by lessons drawn from the document which
has been presented to us.

In conclusion, it is our hope that the combination
of these kinds of initiatives and larger meetings will
bring about a new and stronger commitment to targeted
sanctions, as we are convinced that this can help the
Security Council to promote the effective
implementation of such sanctions, as a major
contribution to international peace and security.
