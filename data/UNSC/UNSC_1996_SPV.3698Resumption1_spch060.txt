Mr. Ka, Chairman of the Committee on the Exercise
of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People:
(interpretation from French): Allow me at the outset to
convey to you, Sir, in my capacity as the Chairman of the
Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of
the Palestinian People, my warm congratulations on your
assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for
the month of September. I should also like to express my
gratitude to the members of the Security Council for
having been kind enough to authorize me to speak at this
meeting, and to share with them the Committee's
appreciation for the speed with which they acceded to the
request of the Arab Group to hold an emergency meeting
devoted essentially to the flare-up of tensions in the land
of Palestine.

Between 1993 and September 1995, the international
community welcomed with joy and relief the signing of
several historic agreements between President Arafat and
the late Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzak Rabin. Those
agreements crowned years of negotiations that were
intended to reach a just and lasting solution to the
question of Palestine and - over and above the question
of Palestine - to end the painful conflict that has raged
in the Middle East for several decades.

This same international community had hailed with
optimism the effective implementation in the field of the
practical arrangements of the different accords and
agreements calling for the withdrawal of Israel from Gaza
and Jericho, the redeployment of Israeli forces and the
establishment of the Palestinian national authority.

Dreams began to become reality with the first free
and democratic elections held on Palestinian land. This
hope for peace finally regained between Israel and its
Arab neighbours, was further nourished by the process of
dialogue that had also begun between Israel and Syria and
which left us hope for a peaceful political settlement to
the question of the occupied Arab Golan.

All of us had hoped that this much-desired peace
process was finally established, and that the return to the
logic of war, hatred and frustration of all kinds had been
banished forever. The tragic events taking place before
our eyes today in the occupied Arab territories once again
highlight the precariousness of the situation in the Middle

 

East and just how dangerous Israeli practices are for the
present peace process.

The decision recently taken by the Israeli Government
to open a tunnel in the Old City of Jerusalem - the holiest
of sites - following the sealing of Palestinian territory,
both within Palestine and in its relations with the exterior,
for several months; the confiscation of Arab lands to build
settlements or roads around areas inhabited by Palestinians;
and the measures of intimidation taken against the Arab
civilian population show that Israel wishes to stifle the
occupied territories economically and to deny the
Palestinian people their right to exercise their legitimate
rights to self-determination and to establish an independent
state, in keeping with international legality and the relevant
resolutions adopted by the United Nations Security Council.

It is therefore important for the international
community to exert pressure and take the measures
necessary so that the inhumane sealing off of the territories
and the restrictions on the movements of Palestinians
imposed by the occupying authorities are lifted; that the
redeployment of Israeli troops from the city of Hebron on
the West Bank should take place as called for in the interim
peace accords signed by the former Israeli Government;
that construction and expansion of settlements should cease;
that the tunnel be closed once and for all; and that, finally,
the protagonists - in order not to prove right the enemies
of peace - resume the peace process that has been under
way since 1993.

Given the Israeli attitude since June 1996, the
Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the
Palestinian People continues to be very much concerned, by
the situation created by Israel, on behalf of its own security
and to the detriment of an entire people whose legitimate
aspiration is to live in peace on the soil of its homeland.

The Palestinian national authorities have clearly shown
their aspirations to live in peace, in dignity and justice with
their neighbours by courageously embarking upon peace
negotiations with the Israeli party since 1991, and by
taking since then widely-known political measures. It is
through this inevitable coexistence that, in the final
analysis, the Middle East - a crossroads of history and of
the world - will become a region of opportunities, an area
of economic growth and political stability.

The Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable
Rights of the Palestinian People remains convinced that
many Israelis are still firmly committed to the peace
process and condemn the delaying measures of their
Government, which would hold back the march of
history.

Strengthened by this conviction and in my capacity
as the Chairman of the Committee on Palestine, I would
like to take the opportunity of this meeting to make an
urgent appeal to the Israeli authorities to ask them to
reconsider their present policy of scorn and confrontation,
and to commit themselves resolutely, as the international
community has constantly called for, to recreate the
conditions for a climate of confidence and hope by
putting the peace process back on the right track - that
of a peace that is profitable to both the Palestinian and
Israeli peoples.
