Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Maybe we could continue this discussion in
an another place. The representative of Ukraine helped
me work on that agreement. We believe it is important.
However, President Yanukovych gave up too much as a
result of that agreement, and it seems that its provisions
were weak. That is true, because he was overthrown,
but the signatories of that agreement should have
insisted on respect for the agreement as signed.

Perhaps the representative of Ukraine has his own
interpretation, but the problem is that, if that agreement
had been respected, then in 2014 Ukraine would have
had a new constitution and there would not have been a
conflict. But it started shooting and started to use force,
and now we have seen what has happened.

Throughout this crisis, we have been repeating
one word: "dialogue, dialogue, dialogue". However,
Ukraine carried out anti-terrorist operations, there
were terrorists, et cetera, and that is what they got.
