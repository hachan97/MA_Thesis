Mr. Oh Joon (Republic of Korea): I would like
to thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his
briefing on the tragic incident in Ukraine.

The Republic of Korea expresses its utmost shock
and outrage at the downing of the Malaysia Airlines
passenger plane in eastern Ukraine yesterday. We
deplore the loss of nearly 300 innocent civilian lives
aboard that commercial airliner. On behalf of the
people and the Government of the Republic of Korea,
I extend my deepest condolences to the people and
Governments of Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Netherlands, the Philippines
and the United Kingdom and other affected countries.
Our hearts go out to the families of the victims at this
difficult time.

A thorough and independent international
investigation, involving, among others, the
International Civil Aviation Organization, must be
conducted immediately. Whoever is responsible for the
tragedy must be held fully accountable. If this incident
turns out to have been caused by a deliberate attack, the
Republic of Korea, itself a former victim of hostilities
against a civilian airlines, believes that the international
community should do everything in its power to bring
the perpetrators to justice as quickly as possible. No
one should be allowed, for any reason, to get away with
killing so many innocent people, who had nothing to do
with what is happening on the ground.

We support the ongoing efforts to bring stability to
Ukraine, in particular the efforts of the United Nations,
the European Union, the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe and bilateral partners.
Such efforts, aimed at de-escalating the violence in
eastern Ukraine, should continue despite the daunting
challenges.
