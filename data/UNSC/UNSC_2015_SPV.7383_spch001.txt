The President (spoke in Chinese): In accordance
with rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure, I invite the representative of Iraq to
participate in this meeting.

In accordance with rule 39 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure, I invite Mr. Nickolay
Mladenov, Special Representative of the Secretary-
General and Head of the United Nations Assistance
Mission for Iraq, to participate in this meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2015/70, which contains the fifth report
of the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 4 of
Security Council resolution 2107 (2013). I also wish to
draw the attention of Council members to document
8/2015/82, the second report of the Secretary-General
pursuant to paragraph 6 of resolution 2169 (2014).

Before giving the floor to Mr. Mladenov, I would
like to take this opportunity, given that this will be his
final briefing to the Council as Special Representative
and Head of the United Nations Assistance Mission
for Iraq, to thank him for his exceptional service. The
Council wishes him every success as he transitions
to his new role as Special Coordinator for the Middle
East Peace Process and Personal Representative of
the Secretary-General to the Palestine Liberation
Organization and the Palestinian Authority, and we
look forward to continuing to work with him in that
capacity.

I now give the floor to Mr. Mladenov.
