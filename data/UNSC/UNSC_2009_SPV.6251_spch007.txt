The President (spoke in French): I thank the
Chairperson of the African Union High-level Panel on
Darfur for his briefing.

There are no further speakers on my list. In
accordance with the understanding reached in the
Council's prior consultations, I how invite Council
members to a private debate to continue the discussion
of the subject. I request delegations that have not
requested to participate in the private debate to be kind
enough to leave the Chamber.

The meeting rose at 11.55 am.
