Ms. Mackenna (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish): The Chilean delegation pays tribute to
Mr. Deng Xiaoping, an outstanding statesman and the
highly regarded leader of the People's Republic of China.
The death of a man who was a great promoter of reform
and the architect of China's opening to the international
community leaves a vacuum on the world scene. His
recognized political stature gives him a special place
among the world leaders of this century.

 

On behalf of the Government of Chile, I wish to
convey to the Government and the people of the People's
Republic of China, through the Permanent Representative
of China to the United Nations, our sincerest condolences
at this enormous loss.
