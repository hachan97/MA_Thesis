Mr. von Pierer: I will make three brief remarks.
First, I understand that there are concerns about how
business can find the right balance between profit-
making and good corporate citizenship. I think it is
possible to find such a balance and, in my opinion,
there is no doubt that it is absolutely mandatory to do
so because business also wants to live a world of peace
and prosperity. The representative of the United States
gave impressive examples of successful companies
receiving awards for their good corporate citizenship.
There are more such good examples. You,
Mr. President, referred to the Global Compact
initiative. I think participation in this initiative is also
an example of how business takes seriously being
successful in the area of corporate citizenship.

Secondly, I would like to come back to the
necessity to fight poverty and the lack of hope. In that
context, I would be glad if we could achieve broad
cooperation among the United Nations, the World
Bank, Governments and private companies to promote
education through a broad and systematic approach. I
would like to reiterate what has been said this
morning- people want hope for their children. A
project for education for peace and prosperity could be
a very effective way of promoting conflict prevention,
peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building.

My third remark is only to thank the Council
again for giving me the opportunity to participate in
this important and very productive meeting this
morning.
