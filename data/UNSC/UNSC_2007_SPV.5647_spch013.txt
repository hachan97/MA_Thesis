Mr. Verbeke (Belgium) (spoke in French):
Belgium voted in favour of resolution 1747 (2007) and
welcomes its unanimous adoption. Belgium regrets that
Iran has not met the requirements of the Security
Council by suspending its uranium-enrichment
activities as well as its work on all heavy-water-related
projects. Belgium deplores the lack of cooperation and
transparency on the part of Iran that led the
International Atomic Energy Agency to conclude, on
22 January, that it was not in a position to provide
assurances about the absence of undeclared nuclear
material and activities in Iran or the exclusively
peaceful purpose of its nuclear programme.

The new resolution serves to demonstrate the
resolve of the international community to monitor the
integrity of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and
also reaffirms its desire to create the framework within
which to search for a negotiated solution.

In that regard, Belgium launches a strong appeal
to Iran to pay due heed to the offer made to it in June
2006, in order to implement a long-term and lasting
agreement.

The new resolution reflects the unanimous
resolve expressed by the Security Council, as stated in
resolution 1737 (2006) and reaffirmed in the current
resolution, to take appropriate additional measures
since Iran has ignored the requirements of the Security
Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
We attach particular importance to the principles of
proportionality and reversibility that are provided for
within the resolution. Those principles reflect the
resolve of the Council, while indicating to Iran that
another path remains open.
