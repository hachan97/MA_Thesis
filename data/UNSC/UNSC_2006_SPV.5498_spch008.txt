Mr. Mahmoud (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): I
apologize for taking the floor a second time.

What good is it to try to deflect attention from the
real massacre, its causes and the source of the fire? The
Lebanese Government has from day one been calling
for a ceasefire. Only an immediate ceasefire will give
civilians from both sides of the border a chance to be
saved from what has been taking place. Even the
humanitarian truce suggested by the Secretary-General
before the weekend was rejected.

It has been clear from the very beginning that it
was not Hizbollah that was the target. It was Lebanon
that was the target. Infrastructure was targeted and
hundreds of civilians were killed before Israel even
took up any campaign against Hizbollah and its
positions.

The Prime Minister has emphatically denied the
allegation that rockets were fired from near the area
that was bombed. In Ramyah and Ayta al-Shab,
civilians will attempt to go to sleep tonight in fear of
Israeli action, after their warning. There is the potential
for a new catastrophe in southern Lebanon if a
ceasefire is not declared.
