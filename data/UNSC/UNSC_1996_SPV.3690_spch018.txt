The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as the representative of Germany.

The subject we are talking about today is terrorism.
Once again we are dealing with the very serious matter of
the attempted assassination of the President of Egypt,
Hosni Mubarak, on 26 June of last year.
My Government's position on terrorism has been
pointed out clearly: we will not give in to terrorism; we
have to fight it. Those who have committed terrorist acts
have to be brought to justice. Those who have supported
terrorists have to bear the consequences.

On several occasions the Council has discussed this
matter and urged the Government of Sudan to comply with
the requests of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
Twice the Security Council has adopted resolutions asking
for the extradition of the suspects and calling upon the
Sudanese Government to desist from any kind of support
for terrorist activities.

The decision on further sanctions is not an easy one.
As we stated earlier, the purpose of sanctions should not be
punishment. The sanctions are aiming at those who are in
a position to take the required measures. The sanctions
should not bring unnecessary suffering to the civilian
population.

Sudan is given another 90 days to comply with these
resolutions. Now it is up to Sudan to show that its words
are followed by deeds. We call upon the Sudanese
Government to give clear evidence of its cooperation and
to do its utmost to bring about the extradition of the
suspects and to provide the international community with
all the information necessary so that the suspects can be
prosecuted in Ethiopia.

On the basis of these considerations, Germany voted
in favour of the adoption of this resolution.

There are no further speakers. The Security Council
has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration

of the item on its agenda.

The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 6.40 pm.
