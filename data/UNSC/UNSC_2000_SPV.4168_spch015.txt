Mr. Van Walsum (Netherlands): It is no secret
that the Security Council has had to spend considerable
time in informal consultations before this resolution
could be adopted. It would, however, be unfortunate if
this should give rise to the assumption, in West Africa
or anywhere else, that there was disagreement within
the Council on the fundamental objective of this
resolution. When the Council is seen to need a great
deal of time to come to an agreement, it is normally
caused by divergence of views as to who is to blame in
a given conflict. This is not what has caused the delay
in this case.

The two issues which first needed to be resolved
were of a totally different nature. The first problem
concerned the initial duration and subsequent extension
of the measures. Our debate on this matter reflected the
general unease about the phenomenon of sanctions that
last much longer than originally intended and then stay
in place only because there is no effective majority in
favour of their abolition. My delegation appreciates
this unease and is strongly in favour of periodic review,
but we continue to be opposed to time limits that lead
to an automatic discontinuation of sanctions in the
absence of a resolution leading to their extension.

The second problem concerned the traditional
reluctance prevalent in certain quarters, if not in certain
continents, to call a spade a spade. This is not really a
disagreement; it is a cultural difference that
international society has to live with.

The debate on these two issues should not be
allowed to offer any relief to those who exploit the
diamond trade to fuel the conflict in Sierra Leone. My
delegation welcomes the resolve of the Security
Council to deprive the Revolutionary United Front of
its means to wage a cruel war against the people of
Sierra Leone.
