Ms. Menendez (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): My
delegation associates itself with the statement that the
representative of Ireland will make later on behalf of
the European Union.

In this and other forums, my country has
repeatedly and firmly opposed extrajudicial killings.
Consequently, we express our rejection and our
condemnation of the extrajudicial killing of Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin and six other people, which took place
yesterday.

As the ministerial Council of the European Union
stated yesterday, 22 March, extrajudicial killings
violate international law and undermine the concept of
the rule of law, which is a fundamental idea and a basic
principle in the fight against terrorism. First of all,
events such as those of yesterday delegitimize the fight
against terrorism in terms of the law. Secondly, they
seriously aggravate an already explosive political
situation, contributing to the spiral of violence.

My country has never been lukewarm in the fight
against terrorism. We condemn terrorism regardless of
its origin. We therefore unambiguously condemn the
terrorist attacks perpetrated by Hamas, which have
caused enormous suffering among the population of
Israel. We reiterate that Israel has the right to defend
itself and to protect its citizens from terrorism.
However, it must exercise that right according to
international law.

I wish to conclude as did the European Council,
asking all sides to refrain from all acts of violence.
Violence will only make even more remote the
possibility of achieving peace and a just and lasting
solution to the conflict in the Middle East. We continue
to believe that the Quartet's road map is the best basis
on which to reach such a solution.
