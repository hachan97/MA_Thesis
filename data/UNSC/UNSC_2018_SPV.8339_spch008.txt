Mr. Michon (France) (spoke in French): We wish
you every success, Madam President, in your country's
presidency in September, which is never an easy
month as it coincides with the plenary session of the
General Assembly.
With regard to the provisional programme of work
that you presented to us this morning, we wish to note
our full support for the programme, including the
consideration of the situation in Nicaragua under the
agenda item "Cooperation between the United Nations
and regional and subregional organizations", which will
allow the Council to engage in an exercise ofpreventive
diplomacy, as provided for by its mandate.
