The President: I thank the representative of
Bangladesh especially for the very practical way in which
he addressed this topic. It is much appreciated.

The next speaker is the representative of India, whose
great country I also had the privilege of visiting last month.
I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to
make his statement.
