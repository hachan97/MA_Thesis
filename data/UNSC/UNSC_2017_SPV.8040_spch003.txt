Mr. Lambertini (Italy) (spoke in French): Italy
voted in favour of resolution 2374 (2017) and affirms
its support for the peace process in Mali. The rapid
and effective implementation of the provisions of the
Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali remains
top priority with a View to ensuring peace and security
in Mali and the Sahel region as a whole. The resolution
provides additional tools, demonstrating the Security
Council's commitment to pursuing this collective goal.

We would like to conclude by thanking the French
delegation for the success of these negotiations, and by
welcoming the full commitment demonstrated by the
Malian Government on this occasion.
