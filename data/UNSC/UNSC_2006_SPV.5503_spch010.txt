Mr. Mitri (Lebanon): I think I have said all I
wanted to say. I think hatred is not in anybody's genes.
Hatred is not in our culture, nor in anyone's culture.
This war will breed hatred, as it breeds despair,
aggravates frustration and produces the sense of being
dispossessed and humiliated. There is a history to
this - a history of injustice. I am sure all the members
of the Council know what history I am talking about.
As to resolution 425 (1978), I was quoting the
Rome presidential statement to suggest that it is not
just Lebanon that has been assertive of the need to be
given back the Sheba'a farms, the Lebanese prisoners
and the maps of the landmines in southern Lebanon.
There is a greater understanding on the part of the
international community concerning those legitimate
requests. I think meeting such legitimate requests is
part of any honourable political solution.
