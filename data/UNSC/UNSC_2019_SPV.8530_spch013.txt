Mr. Cohen (United States of America): I thank
Special Representative Salame, Commissioner Chergui
and Ambassador Schulz for their briefings today.

The United States condemns in the strongest
terms the two terrorist attacks on the United Nations
Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in
Mali last weekend that killed one Nigerian peacekeeper
and wounded several others. We send our condolences
and sympathy to the family of the Nigerian peacekeeper
who was killed and wish a speedy and full recovery to
those who were injured.
Turning back to Libya, foremost on our minds is the
safety of United Nations personnel and civilians on the
ground. We strongly support the personal leadership of
Special Representative Salame' in promoting a political
solution and attempting to reduce the violence in Libya.
We welcome the ongoing efforts of the United Nations
Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) to chart a path
forward that will provide security and prosperity to
all Libyans.

The continuing instability in Tripoli is endangering
civilians, damaging civilian infrastructure, creating
opportunities for terrorists to regroup and fuelling a
worsening humanitarian situation. Lasting peace and
stability will come only through a political solution.
All parties should return to United Nations political
mediation, the success of which depends on a ceasefire
in and around Tripoli. The humanitarian situation
is alarming, and we commend the ongoing efforts to
address the humanitarian dimension of this conflict.

We call on all sides to avoid further escalation and
work constructively with the Special Representative and
UNSMIL to achieve a long-overdue political solution to
this conflict. The United States stands ready to provide
all appropriate assistance as UNSMIL works to help
Libyans return to the political process and de-escalate
the conflict in Tripoli.
