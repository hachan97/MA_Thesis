Mr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): I am sorry to take
the floor again. First of all, I would like to highly
recommend to my Russian colleagues to listen to the
original language that I use in my statements. I did not
mention Russia by name a single time. Likewise, in my
statement, I never referred to Crimea, but since Crimea
was mentioned by the representative of Russia, I would
like to put on the record the following points.

The territory of the autonomous Republic of
Crimea as of today remains under occupation by the
Russian Federation. Under international law, it is the
occupying Power that bears full responsibility for the
consequences of its illegal actions. The statement made
by the Russian representative earlier in this Chamber is
a testament to the inability of the Russian occupation
authorities to address the essential needs of the local
population in any satisfactory manner. Instead of
owning up to its unlawful actions and attempting to
correct the wrongs it has committed, the Russian side
opted to use the issue of the water supply in Crimea as
a propaganda tool.

If the Russian Federation is sincerely concerned
about the issue it raised, it can start by ending the
diversion of scarce water resources in Crimea to feed
the needs of the growing military infrastructure and
military personnel on the peninsula. The next logical
step would be to start the process of deoccupying
the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of
Sevastopol, thereby contributing in a positive way to
addressing the issue of water availability in Crimea.
