Mr. De La Sabliere (France) (spoke in French):
The resolution that we have just unanimously adopted
extends the mandate of the United Nations Operation
in Burundi (ONUB) for six months. It also sends an
important message to the Burundian parties, in
particular to the Forces nationales de liberation of
Agathon Rwasa.

The resolution gives the Security Council an
opportunity to respond to the joint report of ONUB, the
United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo and the Office of the High Commissioner
for Human Rights on the massacre that took place in
Gatumba on 13 August 2004. In its presidential
statement of 15 August 2004, our Council firmly
condemned that crime and asked that the perpetrators
be promptly brought to justice.

In accordance with the recommendation of the
joint report of the United Nations, Burundi has
announced that it will refer the Gatumba incident to the
ICC. We welcome that decision. We also welcome the
fact that the resolution expresses the Security Council's
support for the efforts of United Nations Members to
put an end to impunity, including the efforts
undertaken by States in cooperation with the relevant
international organizations and, in particular, with the
International Criminal Court. The authorities in
Burundi are making significant efforts with regard to
the inquiry into the Gatumba massacre. They deserve
the international assistance they have asked for,
including that of the ICC. It is proper that the Council
encourage all regional Governments and parties
concerned to cooperate actively with those efforts.
