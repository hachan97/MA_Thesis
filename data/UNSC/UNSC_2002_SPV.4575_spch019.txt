The President: I should like to thank the Under-
Secretary-General for those helpful and interesting
clarifications and answers.

When the Secretary-General has submitted his
report, to which we look forward, there will be an
opportunity for discussion and for further questions
and exchanges on the humanitarian issues.

I now give the floor to the Permanent
Representative of Angola.
