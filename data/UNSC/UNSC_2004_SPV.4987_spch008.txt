Mr. Pleuger (Germany): Permit me at the outset
to pay special tribute to the tireless efforts of Lakhdar
Brahimi and his team. Their idealism and their political
skills have been instrumental in the formation of the
new interim Government of Iraq.

Germany welcomes the unanimous adoption of
resolution 1546 (2004). As a result of proposals and
amendments made by various Security Council

members - including the French and German
amendments, which have to a large extent been
included in the resolution - and as a result of

suggestions made by the Iraqi side, and thanks to the
sponsors' constructive and flexible approach in the
course of the negotiations, the text was substantially
improved throughout the negotiation process.

Germany supports this resolution as an important
step towards the restoration of the full sovereignty of
the Iraqi interim Government in all relevant areas and
towards Iraqi ownership. In particular, we do so in
view of the clarifications with regard to the security
partnership between the interim Government of Iraq
and the multinational force, as spelled out in the body
of the resolution and in the letters of Prime Minister
Allawi and of Secretary of State Powell addressed to
the President of the Security Council.

It is now of crucial importance that the resolution
be implemented in Iraq with unequivocal respect for
the full sovereignty of Iraq. Regional and international
support for the Iraqi people is also essential. It is in
that spirit that Germany stands ready to cooperate with
the new Iraqi authorities in order to assist the people of
Iraq in the political and economic reconstruction of
their country.
