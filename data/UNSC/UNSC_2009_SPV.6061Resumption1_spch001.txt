Permanent Representative of Senegal, in which he
requests to be invited, in his capacity as Chairman of
the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable
Rights of the Palestinian People, to participate in the
consideration of the item on the Council's agenda.

If I hear no objection, I shall take it that the
Security Council agrees to extend an invitation under
rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Paul
Badji.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Badji to take the seat reserved for
him at the side of the Council Chamber.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to request all speakers
to limit their statements to no more than five minutes,
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate their texts in writing and
to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Malaysia.
