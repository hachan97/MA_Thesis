Mr. Polyanskiy (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I have asked for the floor to respond to the
remarks made by our German colleague. It seems
that he did not listen very carefully to my statement,
because I did mention international humanitarian law,
for example. Besides that, his attention to the topic
of the statement was also lacking, because the fact is
that we are discussing the political settlement of the
situation in Syria, not the humanitarian situation there,
which is a separate subject. If it had been, I would of
course have paid greater attention to the humanitarian
situation, which was what he wanted to talk about, as
I understand it. I would nevertheless recommend that
he familiarize himself with the bulletins that Russia's
Ministry of Defence puts out regularly, from which
he would see how we deliver and ensure access to
humanitarian aid for those in need. And I can assure
him that we do a great deal of that.

On top of that, I conclude that despite my warning
about the need for a cautious attitude to information
sources on what is going on in Syria, our colleague
the representative of Germany has apparently signed
on as a volunteer in the army of people spreading
unverified information about the actions of Russia and
the legitimate Government of Syria, while forgetting
to find out if that information has been refuted. And,
apparently, he is not planning to resign his commission.
That is of course his choice, and apparently a conscious
one, but I ask him to keep in mind that every reckless
statement like this merely prolongs the suffering of
the residents of Idlib and other areas. It represents yet
another missed opportunity for ensuring a fair trial
for the people who do not want peace in Syria, and it
makes ordinary Syrians' lives a living hell. His rhetoric
helps to legitimize them and protect them from the
punishment they deserve, the necessity for which he
theoretically - I repeat, theoretically - never ceases
to insist on.
