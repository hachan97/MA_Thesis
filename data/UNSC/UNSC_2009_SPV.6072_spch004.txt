The Secretary-General: I hope that members of
the Council will forgive me for not being able to
deliver this briefing myself. I have lost my voice, or
most of it. In any case, Mr. Pascoe was with me every
step of the way. I know that members will not want to
hear my unpleasant-sounding voice, so Mr. Pascoe will
share with the Council what I would have said if I
could. I look forward to speaking with the Council
again as soon as possible.
