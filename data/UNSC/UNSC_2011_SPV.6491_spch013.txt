Mr. Wittig (Germany): Germany welcomes the
Council's swift and decisive action. We are particularly
pleased that the Council is acting in unity.

Today the Council has sent out a clear and strong
message. The international community will not tolerate
the gross and systematic violation of human rights by
the Libyan regime. That is what we owe to the Libyan
people, and that is why we imposed sanctions on the
Libyan leadership. The unanimous referral of the
situation in Libya to the International Criminal Court
demonstrates our resolve not to allow impunity.

This is a clear warning to those who perpetrate
systematic attacks against their civilian population that
they will be held accountable. It should be clear to
everyone that the Council will continue to follow the
situation in Libya very closely.
