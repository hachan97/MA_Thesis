Mr. Pankin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The principal aim of resolution 2017 (2011),
drafted by the Russian Federation and adopted today, is
to curb the uncontrolled proliferation of weapons of all
kinds and related materiel as a result of the Libyan
conflict. Any serious breach of the arms embargo
imposed by the Security Council is likely to destabilize
the entire region. The Libyan authorities must assume
the main responsibility for this task, but it is Clear that
an effective resolution of the problem will require the
constructive cooperation of Libya's neighbours and the
international community as a whole. We are convinced
that consolidated efforts in this area would be in the
interest of all.

In drafting the resolution, we could not fail bear
in mind the great threat posed by Libyan weapons, in
particular man-portable air defence systems, falling
into the hands of terrorist groups that are highly active
in the region. In that regard, civil aviation is equally at
risk. That is why the resolution assigns an active role
to the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive
Directorate and the International Civil Aviation
Organization.

We welcome the consensus adoption of resolution
2017 (2011).
