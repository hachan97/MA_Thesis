The President: I thank Ms. Del Ponte for the
clarifications and answers she has provided.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council will remain seized of the matter.

The meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.
