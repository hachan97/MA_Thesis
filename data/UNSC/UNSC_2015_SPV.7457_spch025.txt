Ms. Power (United States ofAmerica): In closing, I
would just like to note the absurdity of two things. The
first is the representative of the Russian Federation's
citing of the Charter of the United Nations in the
context ofa discussion about Ukraine when, despite the
fact that the Russian presence in Ukraine is an open
secret, there is nothing secret about Russia's declared
annexation of Crimea; and that what was once denied in
this Chamber - namely, that Russian regular soldiers
were in Crimea - is now an openly admitted part of the
facts on the ground that Russia has created in Crimea,
and is what we have seen consistently, as the story has
shifted. I think the representative of Ukraine asked a
very important question. what is the legal authority for
Russia's presence in eastern Ukraine? Where in the
United Nations Charter is that stipulated?

The second irony is the great emphasis on a
political process - an emphasis that everyone in
the Council is deeply invested in. And yet Russia's
response from start to finish in this crisis has been
coercive and militarized. That emphasis on the political
implementation - the core reality that there can only
be a political solution - is something that we urge the
Russian Federation to embrace not only in words but in
actions on the ground.
