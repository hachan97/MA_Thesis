Mr. Shen Guofang (China) (interpretation from Chinese): When the Security Council adopted resolution
1180 (1998) nearly two months ago, my delegation
expressed the hope that the new sanctions would make
UNITA honour its commitments under the Lusaka
Protocol so that the peace process in Angola, which has
been under way for a number of years, could come to a
successful conclusion. Regrettably, the anticipated result
has not come about. To the contrary, the situation in
Angola has of late continuously deteriorated, the peace
process has come to a standstill, and the threat of all-out
armed conflict has grown. We believe that UNITA bears
the main responsibility for this situation.

The peace process in Angola was not easily put in
place. The international community has invested great
resources in that process, and many, including Maitre
Beye, have lost their lives in the name of that process.
The Security Council should do everything possible to
keep the peace process on track.

China calls once again upon UNITA to meet its
obligations immediately and unconditionally, to
demobilize the armed forces under its control, to put an
end to the violence against the United Nations Observer
Mission in Angola (MONUA) and against the
Government and the people of Angola, and to commit
itself to cooperation with the United Nations and with the
Government of Angola to resolve the crisis in a peaceful
manner.

China welcomes the Secretary-Generals appointment
of Mr. Issa Diallo as his new Special Representative in
Angola, and hopes that Mr. Diallo will play a positive
role. We look forward to the report and proposals to be

 

submitted by Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi on the future role of the
United Nations in Angola. Moreover, we are in favour of
extending the mandate of MONUA until 15 September
1998.

The Chinese delegation will vote in favour of the draft
resolution before the Council.
