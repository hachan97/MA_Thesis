Mr. Chen Xu (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
Chinese delegation is in favour of adjustments to the
Goods Review List and the relevant procedures with a
view to improving the humanitarian situation in Iraq.
In this spirit, we took part in the consultations on the
draft resolution and proposed a number of
amendments. We note that China's amendments have
basically been reflected in the text. The text in general
is quite balanced, and that is why China voted in
favour of the draft resolution.

We have also noted the positions of other
members. We, too, believe that if there had been time
for further exchanges of views among members, it
would have been possible to achieve a better result.
What must be pointed out is that the current Goods
Review List and procedures are not perfect. They need
to benefit from the common experience we have gained
through our practice. We hope that, in our future
periodic reviews, the Goods Review List and
procedures will be further adjusted and improved so as
to better meet the humanitarian needs of Iraq and to
ensure normal economic exchanges and trade between
Iraq and other countries.
