The President (spoke in French): There are no
more names inscribed on the list of speakers.

In what is probably the final public meeting for
December 2013, I would like to express the sincere
thanks of my delegation to members of the Council,
as well as to the Council's secretariat for its help. I
would like to thank the interpreters, the translators,
the conference officers and the sound engineers. I
also know that all Council members would join with
me in wishing good luck to Jordan, which will become
President of the Council in January.

Further, on behalf of the Council, I would like
to express the sincere appreciation of the Council
to the five outgoing members, namely, Azerbaijan,
Guatemala, Morocco, Pakistan and Togo. I commend
their hard work during their 2012-2013 term and the
contributions they brought to the Council's work.

What Ijust said is official. What I would like to
add on a more personal note is the expression of my
deepest gratitude. For two years, we have had friendly
relations, which will continue after 1 January 2014. We
have appreciated their competence, their dedication and
their contributions. We will continue to work together.
We thank them from the bottom of our hearts for having
been with us, alongside us, in the activities of the
Security Council. As the Permanent Representative of
Togo has rightly said, those actions, while not perfect,
seek to defend peace, security and the values of the
United Nations.

Finally, I wish one and all around the table and
present in the Chamber my best wishes for the upcoming
year-end holidays.

The meeting rose at 12.40 pm.
