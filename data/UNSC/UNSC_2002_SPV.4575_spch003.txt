The President: I extend warm thanks to the
Emergency Relief Coordinator for his briefing and for
the fact sheets and other details that he has given us in
writing.

In case members of the Council were wondering,
we have received no requests from the delegation of
Angola to be at the Council table at this meeting.
Could I just check whether there is a representative of
Angola at the side of the Council Chamber? I see that
there is a representative of the delegation here.

The floor is now open for those who want to put
brief comments and questions.
