Mr. Queta (Guinea-Bissau) (interpretation from French): My delegation has considered very carefully the
deliberations of the Council of the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO), convened to examine the
question of the destruction, on 24 February 1996, of two
private civil aircraft registered in the United States. The two
airplanes shot down belonged to the Brothers to the Rescue
organization. We should like to express once again our
regret at the four deaths that resulted from this incident.

This act is a violation of article 3 bis of the
Convention on International Civil Aviation, under which no
circumstance and no argument can justify the use of
weapons against civil aircraft in flight.

My Government believes that respect for the rules of
international law is an indispensable condition for the
maintenance of international peace and security. In this
context, we feel that the draft resolution before us,
particularly in its paragraphs 4 and 5 , sends a clear message
aimed at avoiding such incidents in the future. My
delegation will support the draft resolution.
