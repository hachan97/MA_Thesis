The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document 5/2003/290, which contains the text of a
letter dated 6 March 2003 from the Secretary-General
addressed to the President of the Security Council
regarding the nominations which have been received
for ad litem judges of the International Tribunal for
Rwanda. In this connection, the members of the
Council will note the information contained in the
Secretary-General's letter.

Members of the Council also have before them
the draft of a letter that I, as President of the Council,
would propose to send to the Secretary-General in
reply to the aforementioned letter, informing him of the
Council's decision to extend the deadline for
nominations of ad litem judges of the Tribunal until 15
April 2003. In the absence of objections, I shall assume
that the Security Council agrees that I should send this
letter as drafted to the Secretary-General.

It is so decided.

The letter will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/2003/379.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.
The meeting rose at 12.30 19.171.
