The delegation of Viet Nam would like to express its profound disappointment at the fact that the Security Council has been unable to adopt a draft resolution renewing the cross-border humanitarian assistance mechanism for Syria. It is our strong belief that discussion on the renewal should continue in the next few days to find an optimal solution for supporting the most vulnerable population. Viet Nam voted in favour of the two draft resolutions contained in documents S/2020/654 and S/2020/658, bearing in mind the critical need to maintain the life- saving humanitarian operations in Syria. It is crystal-clear to us that the continuation of this mechanism must be ensured in order to respond to the considerable humanitarian needs on the ground at this time. The humanitarian situation in Syria is alarming, especially when it is being further aggravated by the impact of the coronavirus disease pandemic and the exceptionally severe economic crisis. The gravity of the situation now continues to prove the need for enhancing the humanitarian response. As the lives of millions of people are at stake, we would like to emphasize that Council members cannot afford to be in disaccord. This requires constant efforts by all parties to find a way out of this current impasse through genuine dialogue and extensive consultations focusing solely on humanitarian aspects. My delegation supports the efforts of the international community in providing humanitarian assistance to people across Syria and will continue to engage actively towards that common noble goal. Without a doubt, it is of the utmost importance that the Security Council show unity in supporting people in need. The Syrians and the international community expect nothing less from us.
