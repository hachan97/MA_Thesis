The President: I may well come back to the
Under-Secretary-General or to his representative
during the course of the discussion to pick up points
from the debate as it is taken forward by non-members
of the Council.

We now move to the speakers' list under rule 37,
and I intend to get through the speakers' list today,
however long it takes. I hope that people will leave
room for later speakers.

The next speaker on my list is the representative
of Canada, whom I invite to take a seat at the Council
table and to make his statement.
