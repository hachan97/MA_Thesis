Mr. Urbina (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): As
we said only two days ago, resolution 1850 (2008) and
the President's statement to the press of 28 December
2008 (see press release SC/9559) were not sufficient to
halt the continuing deterioration of the humanitarian
situation and the escalation of violence and their
appalling consequences for the civilian population of
the Gaza Strip. Nor were they sufficient to ease the
fear experienced by the Israeli population because of
the launching of rockets into their territory by
Palestinian factions, including Hamas militants.

Today, after much apprehension and travail, the
Council has adopted a resolution which, while not
having received all the necessary political support, has
tremendous moral force. The Council has adopted a
resolution calling on the parties to the conflict to bring
about an immediate cessation of hostilities. The
resolution unequivocally reflects the overwhelming
resolve of the international community, which has
followed the work of the Council with great attention.

It is appropriate now to underscore the legally
binding nature of this resolution. Compliance by all
parties to the conflict is mandatory. The parties must
understand clearly that failure to comply could, and
should, entail serious consequences.

My delegation has advocated that the Security
Council should make an active contribution to peace in
the Middle East. Today, I believe that we are
contributing to the attainment of that lofty goal. We
harbour the hope that the Council will also be
consistent with the decision it has taken today and that
it will use its authority in order to ensure respect for
that decision.

I hardly need say that my delegation will work
with all other members of the Council to make an
effective contribution to peace and well-being for all
inhabitants of the Middle East.
