The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Australia, Austria, Brazil, Fiji,
Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines,
Portugal, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Timor-
Leste, in which they request to be invited to participate
in the consideration of the item on the Council's
agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite
those representatives to participate in the consideration
without the right to vote, in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Guterres
(Timor-Leste) took a seat at the Council table;
the representatives of the other aforementioned
countries took the seats reserved for them at the
side ofthe Council Chamber.

The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Ian Martin,
Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Timor-
Leste.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Martin to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
photocopies of a letter dated 13 June 2006 from the
Secretary-General transmitting a letter from the
President, Prime Minister and President of the National
Parliament of Timor-Leste, which will be issued as a
document of the Security Council under the symbol

I welcome the presence of the Secretary-General
and invite him to take the floor.
