Mr. Shen Bo (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
would like to thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs of
Ukraine, Mr. Leonid Kozhara, for his briefing on behalf
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE). As an important regional organization,
over the years the OSCE has made a positive contribution
to efforts to conduct preventive diplomacy, enhance
security and mutual trust, mediate regional disputes
and combat transnational crime. China appreciates
those efforts, and we encourage the OSCE to continue
to exploit its advantages and to play a constructive
role in maintaining regional peace, security and
stability. China believes that strengthening United
Nations cooperation with regional and subregional
organizations is very important to the maintenance
of international peace and security, as set out in the
Charter of the United Nations.

The Security Council bears the primary responsibilty
for the maintenance of international peace and security.
Regional and subregional organizations, with their
unique advantages, are in a position to support and
collaborate with the Security Council as a useful
complement to its work. The OSCE is an important
cooperation partner for the United Nations. China
encourages the Security Council to cooperate with the
OSCE in the maintenance of international peace and
security in a manner that is more results-oriented and
effective.
