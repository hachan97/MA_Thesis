Mr. Jagne (Gambia): My delegation would like to
express its profound gratitude to President Chiluba for his
indefatigable efforts leading to the breakthrough in the
quest for a lasting peace in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo.

We all agree that there is hope for peace, but this does
not mean that we should rest on our laurels. This is just the
beginning of the end, and without the necessary resources
from the rest of the international community to consolidate
these initial achievements we cannot see how the process
could be carried through.

With the presence of President Chiluba today and his
message of hope to the Security Council, we are confident
that the much needed cooperation between the Security
Council and Africa will now be placed on a firmer footing.
We can say without fear of contradiction that, having heard
from President Chiluba, speaking on behalf of Africa, the
Council will not shy away this time around, but will give
us a helping hand in the true spirit of international
solidarity to dispel any notion of Afro-fatigue syndrome.
