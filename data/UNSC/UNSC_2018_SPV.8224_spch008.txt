Mr. Umarov (Kazakhstan): Having heard the
statements of the representatives of the United Kingdom
and the Russian Federation, we also would like to share
our observations on this issue.

Kazakhstan has a well-deserved international
reputation as an unequivocal opponent of all kinds
of weapons of mass destruction, including chemical
weapons and poisonous substances. We categorically
condemn any use of weapons of mass destruction as
immoral, inhuman and contrary to the principles
of humanity.

We express our deep concern about the tragic
incident involving the possible use of a weapons-
grade chemical agent on the territory of the United
Kingdom. We look forward to the publication of all
concrete facts and evidence confirming the use of any
kind of weapons-grade chemical agent as well as the
involvement of individuals, non-State actors or States.

We count on a comprehensive, transparent and
impartial investigation of the incident in accordance
with the existing norms of international law, in particular
on the basis of the provisions of the Convention on
the Prohibition of the Development, Production,
Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their
Destruction, and expect the international community to
be provided with the conclusions and evidence.

We express our hope for the normalization of
relations and the restoration of trust between the
leading States, the preservation of the integrity of
the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons and joint efforts to counter common threats
to security, as well as the renunciation of the so-called
bloc mentality. We call on all interested States to unite
and to resolve all issues resulting from the incident in
the United Kingdom in accordance with the norms of
international law, in line with the spirit and principles
of the Astana Commemorative Declaration of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
