Mr. Konuzin (Russian Federation)(spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation attaches great
significance to the Bougainville Peace Agreement of
30 August 2001, which is a basis for the peace process
in that country. We call upon all the parties to
undertake timely and full implementation of the tasks
set forth in the Agreement to establish autonomy, to
conduct a referendum and to carry out steps for the
collection and destruction of weapons.

A most important condition for progress in the
peace process is a demonstration by the parties of
political will and the desire to achieve a speedy
solution to basic problems in the settlement of the
conflict.

We highly value the efforts of the United Nations
Political Office in Bougainville (UNPOB) and the
activities of its head, Ambassador Sinclair, as well as
the Military Observer Group, to promote the
implementation of the Bougainville Peace Agreement.
We note the effectiveness of the work of UNPOB,
which, over a short period of time and with limited
resources, has been able to achieve significant results.

The delay in the implementation of the weapons
collection and destruction plan in Bougainville is a
cause for concern. We hope that all the parties, with the
active support of the Government of Papua New
Guinea, will intensify their efforts to eliminate
weapons in the communities of Bougainville. Success
in that area will have a decisive impact on progress in
the post-conflict rehabilitation and peace-building
processes in Bougainville and can help to establish
favourable conditions for the international
community's provision of necessary economic
assistance to tens of thousands of Bougainvilleans.

Russia supports the positive efforts being
undertaken to achieve a final settlement of the conflict
in Bougainville, and it is prepared to contribute to
future progress in that process.
