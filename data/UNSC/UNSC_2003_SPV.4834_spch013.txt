Mr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): We are
grateful to Mr. Kalomoh and the Minister from Timor-
Leste for their statements on the situation in Guinea-
Bissau.
We condemn the coup d'e'tat that took place on 14
September, although we are pleased to see that there
were no victims and that former President Kumba Yala
preferred to relinquish his post after a period of
political and economic instability.

We appeal to the military authorities to reinstate
constitutional rule of law without delay. To this end,
we welcome the appointments made yesterday to set up
a provisional transitional Government. The restoration
of civilian transitional institutions should contribute to
the process of national reconciliation and lead to free
and democratic elections in the short term and,
ultimately, the election of a new President of the
Republic.

Finally, we would like to appeal for the provision
of emergency assistance to Guinea-Bissau, which is
faced with a steadily worsening economic and social
situation.
