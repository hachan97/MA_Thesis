Mr. Rosselli (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish):
Uruguay participated actively in the drafting of
resolution 2303 (2015) and commends the dedication
and patient work of the penholder in the drafting of
the text, which we have just adopted. In drafting the
text, we were fundamentally motivated by the urgent
need to address the grave humanitarian situation in
Burundi. Reliable sources, such as the United Nations
High Commissioner for Human Rights, UNICEF
and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs, have denounced the persistence of and, in
some cases, the increase in human rights violations in
Burundi - cases of torture, forced disappearances,
sexual violence, arbitrary detention and restrictions on
fundamental freedoms. Against this critical backdrop,
measures set forth in the resolution, including the
sending of a police officers component, could help
provide relief from the extreme vulnerability that the
people of Burundi are experiencing, which requires
immediate attention.

The resolution authorizes the deployment of
a maximum of 228 police officers. In Uruguay's
judgment, the rate at which they are deployed should be
coordinated with the authorities of Burundi in order to
achieve the successful implementation of the resolution
we have adopted today.
