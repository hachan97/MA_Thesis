Mr. Duclos (France) (spoke in French): First of
all, I would like to thank Ambassador Sinclair for his
detailed and clear briefing. More generally, I would
like to thank the staff of the United Nations Political
Office in Bougainville (UNPOB) for the work that they
have accomplished. I would also like to thank our
colleague from Papua New Guinea for the
clarifications that he provided. I would further like to
take this opportunity to congratulate the Peace
Monitoring Group and its contributing countries on
their activities.

I would like to make three brief comments. First,
the conclusion of stage II of weapons disposal is, of
course, a welcome development after more than a year
of successive delays. We must now move on to stage
III - the final decision on weapons disposal -
without delay.

Secondly, we believe that establishing contacts
with Francis Ona with a view to bringing him into the
peace process should be continued. Such a dialogue
should not, however, result in any delay in the priority
implementation of the Bougainville Peace Agreement.

Thirdly, we would like to encourage the efforts of
Papua New Guinea and of all the parties. Such efforts
must be directed towards setting a date for the speedy
organization of elections in Bougainville, the effective
holding of those elections and, finally, the
establishment of an autonomous Government.
