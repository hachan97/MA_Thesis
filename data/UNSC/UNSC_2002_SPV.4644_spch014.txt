Mr. Valdivieso (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I
wish briefly to note some of the reasons for which
Colombia voted in favour of the resolution.

From the outset of the negotiations, Colombia
stressed the legal and political need for a resolution
acknowledging the new facts and circumstances
surrounding the item on Iraq since 12 September. Such
a resolution would reinforce the mandate of the United
Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection
Commission and International Atomic Energy Agency
inspectors so as to ensure that the inspections are
credible and to dispel doubts about possible prohibited
weapons programmes. We also said that we must send
a clear message to Iraq that the international
community does not intend to wait any longer for
compliance with the demands made by the Security
Council on its behalf.

We also noted that the resolution should be
sufficiently forceful and effective to obtain the
disarmament of Iraq once and for all and to close the
chapter that was opened more than a decade ago with
Iraq's aggression against Kuwait. We insisted on
preserving the central role of the Security Council, as
clearly stipulated in paragraphs 4, 11 and 12. This
resolution is not, nor could it be at this time, a
resolution to authorize the use of force. It provides a
one-time opportunity. Now it is up to Iraq to
demonstrate its will to cooperate and its desire to fully
reincorporate itself into the community of nations. The
cooperation of its Government is indispensable, and in
that regard, the declaration requested of it - to be
provided during the next 30 days, starting as of
today - is essential.

The Council's cohesion, evident in today's
unanimous vote, has the advantage of transcending this
episode, as it signals the Council's capacity to respond
to new and more severe challenges with which the new
millennium has begun.
