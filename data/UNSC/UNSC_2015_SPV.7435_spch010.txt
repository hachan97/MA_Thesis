The President (spoke in Arabic): I shall now make
a statement in my capacity as representative of Jordan.

I would first like to thank Mr. Ross and Ms. Bolduc
for their efforts. Jordan voted in favour of resolution 2218
(2015), and we believe that, if it is fully implemented by
the parties concerned, it can lead to a lasting solution
to the issue of Western Sahara, since it includes all the
elements necessary to enable that goal to be achieved.

We would like to emphasize the importance of
cooperation by the parties with the efforts of the
Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Western
Sahara, and with the United Nations Mission for the
Referendum in Western Sahara, in order to enable it to
fulfil its aims. Those include enforcing the ceasefire
and conducting de-mining, as well as strengthening
confidence-building measures. The United Nations,
as the only organization recognized by both parties,
remains the only body capable of bringing together the
parties' positions in order to achieve a just and lasting
solution to the issue, based on the relevant Security
Council resolutions and on respect for the Charter of
the United Nations and international law. It should also
take into account the concerns of the people of Western
Sahara.

We reaffirm that Morocco's proposal on self-
determination is a serious one, and we welcome its
efforts to make concrete improvements in the human-
rights situation in Western Sahara.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

The meeting rose at 10.45 am.
