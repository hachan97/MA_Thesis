Mr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): I am gratified
above all that, given the importance of the topic under
consideration, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada
has presided over this meeting. I am also pleased to see
the Minister of External Affairs of Angola here with us
today.

My delegation associates itself with the statement
made by the Permanent Representative of Portugal on
behalf of the European Union.

Spain is convinced of the necessity, usefulness and
effectiveness of the sanctions regime imposed by the
Security Council on UNITA. We believe that the
sanctions are working and we wish to stress the
remarkable and indispensable role that has been played in
this respect by Ambassador Robert Fowler, the Chairman
of the Security Council Committee established pursuant
to resolution 864 (1993) concerning the situation in
Angola. He has given decisive impetus to this issue,
demonstrating yet again his professionalism, effectiveness
and diplomatic know-how.

Furthermore, my country welcomes the report of the
Panel of Experts established by the Security Council
pursuant to resolution 1237 (1999). We believe that the
report's contents and imaginative and bold
recommendations represent a qualitative step forward with
regard to sanctions and an indispensable contribution to
a peaceful solution to the situation in Angola. In this
context, we congratulate Ambassador Mollander, the
Chairman of the Panel of Experts.

We are convinced that all Member States must
cooperate to implement these sanctions and remain
vigilant in order to ensure their enforcement. The Security
Council must be in a position to respond appropriately to
sanctions busting.
