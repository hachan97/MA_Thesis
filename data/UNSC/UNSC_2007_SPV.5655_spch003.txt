The President: I thank Sir John for his first
briefing to the Council. I am sure I speak for the
Council in wishing him every success in his
stewardship of the Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs.

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who have inscribed their names on the list and
who wish to make comments or ask questions in
response to the briefing we have just heard.
