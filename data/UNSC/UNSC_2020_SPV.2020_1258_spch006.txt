I am grateful to South Africa, President of the Security Council and Vice- Chair of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 2374 (2017) concerning Mali, for allowing me to share some reflections on my experience in the course of my mandate as Chair of the 2374 (2017) Committee, in the hope that it will provide the incoming Chair and others with relevant information and guidance. First of all, I would like to duly acknowledge the important work carried out by the Security Council Affairs Division in support of the Chair and the members of the 2374 (2017) Committee so that it could be efficient in the conduct of its work, in the implementation of resolution 2374 (2017), both in procedural and substantive terms, including logistical matters, and in the transition processes that entail the induction of new members and experts. Furthermore, we duly recognize the essential role played by the Panel of Experts in supporting the Committee in carrying out the mandate specified in resolution 2374 (2017), primarily in providing the Committee with information relevant to the possible appointment of individuals in accordance with the established criteria, implementation of the agreed measures, and the updating of the persons on the sanctions list. In this regard, I would like to emphasize the importance of supporting the work of the Panel of Experts in assisting the Committee to fulfil its mandate, and by this we mean granting them the independence necessary for an objective analysis of the information collected, so that the Committee has a broad critical background that allows it to better undertake the tasks assigned to it. In directing the work of the Committee, the Dominican Republic focused on the full and effective implementation of its basic mandate, emphasizing transparency, the promotion of dialogue and relevant and inclusive participation, independent and objective analysis, and the appropriate handling of sensitive information. Undoubtedly, the Committee's work in these and other areas can and should be further improved. With regard to improvements in transparency, the participation of interested Member States, in particular the countries of the region, in certain informal meetings of the Committee would contribute to confidence-building and a better understanding of and support for the sanctions regime, allowing for greater clarity and encouraging compliance with its obligations, while providing the Committee with additional information that would guarantee the highest level of objectivity and justice. In addition, the Chair of the Committee's visits to Mali and the region - in my case from 16 to 18 October 2019 - provide a great opportunity - and one that should be prioritized in the work programme - to hold meetings with the main actors and obtain relevant information from primary sources, thereby promoting a better understanding of the sanctions, including the processes of listing and delisting. Unfortunately, the coronavirus disease pandemic has affected the modalities of work in all areas, including that of the Committee, limiting face-to-face meetings to a virtual format and requiring postponement of visits to the region until conditions permit, although the possibility of coordinating a visit in the short to medium term under this modality should be studied. Another important challenge is the impact of last August's coup d'etat in Mali, an event that is undermining the constitutional order and, taking place during a process of transition towards the restoration of democracy, risks delaying the implementation of the Peace and Reconciliation Agreement in Mali and eroding the achievements made so far. Finally, I would like to thank all the members of the Committee, as well as the relevant United Nations bodies, including the leadership of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, for their exceptional work and support during my term of office, as a faithful demonstration of the commitment of each one of us to contributing to the peace, security and lasting stability of the country.
