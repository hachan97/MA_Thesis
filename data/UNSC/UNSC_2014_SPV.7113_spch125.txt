Mr. Musayev (Azerbaijan): My delegation is taking
the floor once again to react to the totally groundless
remarks just made by the representative of Armenia.

It has become the distinctive nature of the policy
of Armenia to level accusations against a country
whose territories it keeps under occupation and whose
civilians it has brutally massacred and still continues
to kill on a daily basis. It is unfortunate that the forum
provided by the Security Council has once again been
abused to disseminate lies.

There is only one question that needs to be asked:
what can be the weight of statements by a country whose
President and other high-level officials are responsible
for war crimes and crimes against humanity? It is
curious that Armenia has the cheek to criticize and
lecture others on such a notion as justice, which is a
priori alien to that country's policy and practice.

The best way to address the existing challenges
and concerns is to ensure that the occupation of the
territories of Azerbaijan is ended, that the rights of the
forcibly displaced population to return to their homes
is exercised without further delay, and that all those
responsible for the serious crimes committed against
Azerbaijani civilians in the course of the conflict are
brought to justice.
