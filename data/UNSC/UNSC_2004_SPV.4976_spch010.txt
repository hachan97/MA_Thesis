Mr. Trautwein (Germany): Germany fully
subscribes to the statement to be made later by the
presidency of the European Union, which will be
delivered by the Ambassador of Ireland. I will
therefore limit my statement.

First of all, I would like to thank the Chairman of
the Committee, Ambassador Mufioz, for his
comprehensive and very instructive report. In
particular, we appreciate his continued close dialogue
with Member States. The countries he recently visited
are important and reliable partners in the struggle
against terrorism.

Secondly, I welcome the new Monitoring Team
and its coordinator, Mr. Richard Barrett, who have
recently taken up their duties and have prepared an
ambitious work plan. We commend them for having
started their activities by establishing direct working
contacts with a large number of Member States. In
Germany they will find open doors, as did their
predecessors. We are looking forward to continued and
fruitful cooperation.
