The President (spoke in Russian): I would like to
assure the representative of the Republic of Korea that the
members of the Security Council will try by all possible
means to take into account the views of all Member States
in this case. It is precisely for this reason that we have held
this meeting today rather than last Friday, thus giving all
the non-members of the Council the opportunity to
familiarize themselves with the draft resolution.

The next speaker is the representative of Norway. I
invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make
his statement.
