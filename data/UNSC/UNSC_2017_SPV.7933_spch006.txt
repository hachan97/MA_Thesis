Mr. Zhang Dianbin (China) (spoke in Chinese):
Western Sahara is currently facing a complicated
situation. What is urgent now is to maintain stability
in the region and create a favourable condition for
relaunching the political process.

The Security Council has just adopted resolution
2351 (2017), renewing the mandate of the United
Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara (MINURSO) for one year and calling for the
resumption of talks and the political process. This
shows the determination of the Council to push for a
political solution of the issue and adhere to the Mission's
mandate.

On the issue of Western Sahara, China has always
held an objective and impartial position. We encourage
both parties, on the basis ofrelevant Council resolutions,
to seek a negotiated solution that is just, lasting and
mutually acceptable to both parties. We shall continue
to support the United Nations in its effort to find a
political solution of the issue of Western Sahara and we
hope that MINURSO will continue to play an important
role in implementing Security Council resolutions and
stabilizing the situation in Western Sahara.
