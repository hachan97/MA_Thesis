Mr. Jiirgenson (Estonia): I thank the briefers for their insightful overviews of the latest developments in Guinea-Bissau. We were encouraged to see that the presidential elections in Guinea-Bissau were held in a generally peaceful atmosphere. However, we urge the parties to refrain from using inflammatory rhetoric and also using potential tensions in society for their own political gains. It is important that the final confirmation of the results of the 2019 presidential elections be announced soon. There is a clear need to create conditions for trust between the political actors and to move forward with the necessary economic and social reforms. We welcome the timely and decisive engagement of the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union at the end of last year to prevent the deterioration of the political situation in Guinea-Bissau and support their continued engagement in the matter. The participation of women and youth in reform processes and peacebuilding activities is of crucial importance. We are glad that a high level of participation of women in the electoral process was achieved and urge the Government of Guinea-Bissau to further integrate and implement gender aspects in its policies. Estonia supports the work of Special Representative of the Secretary-General Sori-Coulibaly and the planned activities of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS), including the phased drawdown as set out in the current mission's mandate. It is very important that while the mission is planning for the transfer of its tasks to the United Nations country team, the United Nations Office for West Africa and the Sahel and other partners, a holistic approach to peacebuilding activities be taken. The Peacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding Fund can play an important supportive role in this regard.
