The President: I shall now make a further statement
in my national capacity.

With reference to the statements made by two
delegations that mentioned a specific case, I would like
to state that the issue concerns two security personnel
who fired without provocation on two unarmed
fishermen and killed them. The case is sub judice and is
being dealt with in accordance with the due process of
law. This is also in consonance with international law.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

There are no more names inscribed on the list of
speakers. The Security Council has thus concluded
the present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 6.05 pm.
