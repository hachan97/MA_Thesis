The President (spoke in French): I should like to
issue a reminder about our work. Statements should last
for no more than four minutes, so that we can conclude
today's discussion in a timely manner. Delegations that
wish to make longer statements are asked to make the
full statement available in writing and make a shorter
statement here in the Council. Delegations are also
requested to speak at a normal speed for purposes
of interpretation.

I wish also to inform all concerned that we will
continue with this open debate right through the lunch
hour, given the very large number of speakers.

I give the floor to the Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister for International Development Cooperation
and Climate of Sweden.
