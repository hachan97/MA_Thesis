I thank Ms. Bensouda for her briefing and welcome Ambassador Elsonni to this meeting. The conflict in Libya has been raging for many years, wreaking havoc on the country and its neighbours, bringing enormous suffering to the Libyan people and threatening international peace and security. The situation changes rapidly. We note the recent announcements by relevant parties and reaffirm that there is no military solution. China has always believed that the issue of Libya must be resolved through a political process. We welcome any efforts conducive to a lasting ceasefire and a response to the Secretary-General's appeal for a global ceasefire, especially during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and Ramadan. China calls upon all parties to the conflict to put the interests of the country and the people first and to reach a permanent ceasefire as soon as possible. Under the current circumstances, the people of Libya deserve a peaceful environment to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. China supports a Libyan-owned, Libyan-led political settlement process and encourages the United Nations and such regional organizations as the African Union and the League of Arab States to continue their mediation efforts and create synergies. We call on all Member States to strictly implement the arms embargo. While respecting Libya's independence, unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity, the international community should continue to provide assistance to Libya so that the country may achieve peace, stability and development as soon as possible. With regard to the International Criminal Court, China's position remains unchanged.
