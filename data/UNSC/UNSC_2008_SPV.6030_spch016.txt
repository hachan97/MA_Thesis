Mr. Bui The Giang (Viet Nam): As it has clearly
stated on many occasions, Viet Nam is deeply
concerned about the deteriorating humanitarian
situation in Gaza, where more than 1.5 million
Palestinians continue to suffer from a lack of food and
medicine, the suspension of electricity and fuel
supplies, the halting of services in hospitals and
bakeries, the withholding of heating supplies during
the winter and the paralysed functioning of sanitation
and water facilities.

Against such a backdrop, we have followed with
close attention the case of the vessel Al-Marwa. While
underlining the responsibilities of both parties under
the Road Map and relevant resolutions of the Security
Council to refrain from any act or statement that may
be detrimental to the peace effort, we once again urge
Israel scrupulously to abide by international law -
above all human rights and humanitarian law - put an
immediate end to restrictive measures, open the border
crossings, and ensure unfettered access for
international assistance and humanitarian relief to the
Palestinian population in all occupied territories. We
call on all parties concerned to strengthen constructive
dialogue and cooperation in order to arrive at a
mutually acceptable solution, thereby promoting an
environment most conducive to the peaceful settlement
of disputes and to meeting the legitimate interests of
the Palestinian people.

We support every effort of the United Nations,
the Quartet and the international community at large to
alleviate and ultimately end the humanitarian crisis in
Gaza. In that connection, we wish to express our
appreciation of the role played by the League of Arab
States and Egypt, in particular in lessening the grave
humanitarian situation in that part of the world.
