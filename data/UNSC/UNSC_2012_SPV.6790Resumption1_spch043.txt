The President (spoke in Chinese): There are still
a few more speakers remaining on my list who wish
to address the Council, as well as some who wish to
make additional comments. Once again, I would like
to remind representatives to limit their statements to
four minutes so that we can expedite our work and
hopefully conclude our consideration of the item before
the Council before 6 pm.

I now give the floor to the representative of the
Philippines.
