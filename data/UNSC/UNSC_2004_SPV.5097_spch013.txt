Mr. Li Song (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
Chinese delegation would like to thank Ambassador
Motoc for briefing us on the work of the Security
Council Committee established pursuant to resolution
1540 (2004). We appreciate the work he has done in his
capacity as Chairman of that Committee.

Over the past seven months since the adoption of
resolution 1540 (2004) by the Council on 28 April this
year, the 1540 Committee has made encouraging
progress in its work. With about 90 countries having
submitted their initial reports, the Committee will
begin its considerations very soon.

Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) is
significant for enhancing international cooperation in
addressing the problem of the illicit trafficking in
nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons and their
means of delivery and related materials by non-State
actors and in preventing the further proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction.

China hopes that, in the implementation of the
resolution, States will strive to achieve the goal of non-
proliferation by peaceful means and enter into
international cooperation on the basis of equality and
trust and in strict accordance with international law.
We also hope that the Committee will consider its
national reports in a fair, transparent and cooperative
manner and will hire more experts from developing
countries to assist in its work.

China is one of the first countries to submit its
national report. We hope that report will afford an
opportunity for others to gain comprehensive
knowledge of our efforts in combating the trafficking
of weapons of mass destruction. China will continue to
implement resolution 1540 (2004) in good faith and
will make its own contribution to the work of the
Committee.
