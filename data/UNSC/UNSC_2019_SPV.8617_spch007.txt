Mr. Pecsteen de Buytswerve (Belgium) (spoke in French): First of all, I, too, would like to welcome our
colleague from the United States.

Belgium welcomes today's adoption of resolution
2488 (2019), through which the Security Council notes
the progress made by the Central African Republic in
reforming its security sector. Its authorities now benefit
from the easing of the arms embargo imposed on the
country. It demonstrates the trust we have in the Central
African Republic and our support for efforts to restore
State authority.

The signing of the Political Agreement for Peace
and Reconciliation in the Central African Republic,
on 6 February, marked a new beginning. We support
the Government in its efforts. We also call on other
signatories to respect their commitments. The recent
outbreaks of violence, in Birao, for example, are
unacceptable. In that context, the sanctions regime
remains relevant.

I will conclude by reiterating Belgium's support
for President Touadera's Government, Special
Representative Mankeur Ndiaye and the United Nations
Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in
the Central African Republic.
