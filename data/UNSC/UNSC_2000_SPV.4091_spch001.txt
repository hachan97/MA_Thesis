The President: In accordance with the understanding
reached in the Council's prior consultations, and in the
absence of any objection, I shall take it that the Security
Council agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to the Facilitator of the
Burundi peace process, Mr. Nelson Mandela.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Mandela to take a seat at the Council
table.

I would note for the members of the Security Council
and for the audience that President Mandela will need to
depart this meeting at approximately 11.45 am. At that
point, we will have a brief suspension and then resume the
debate.

The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

It is now my great honour to call on my friend, our
colleague and our associate, the Secretary-General of the
United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, to begin today's
discussion.
