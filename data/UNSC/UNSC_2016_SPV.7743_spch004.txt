Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We regard the adoption of resolution 2298
(2016), authorizing the transfer of chemical weapons
stockpiles from Libya and their subsequent destruction
as an important step in chemical demilitarization.
Given the intensified presence of various terrorist
groups in Libya, this step is a timely. There was an
eminent danger of those chemical weapons falling into
their hands.

The examples of Syria and Iraq have shown how
acute the problem of chemical terrorism is for the region.
Not enough is being done to combat the problem today,
occasionally owing to artificially politicized reasons.
However, the Russian Federation has always strongly
advocated concrete initiatives enabling a collective
response commensurate with the threat.

We believe that the containers of chemical weapons
that have been transported to the coast must be removed
from Libya as quickly as possible and safely destroyed.
The Security Council will keep a close watch on that
operation. We stress that the destruction of all Libyan
stockpiles of chemical weapons must be carried out in
strict compliance with the relevant procedures of the
Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
(OPCW). That is especially important because it was
recently shown that during the long-term storage of
toxic substances, stockpiles shrank by 220 tons. This

phenomenon must be explained and justified in a
scientific manner within the framework of the ongoing
OPCW investigations. Similar requirements should be
applied to all States parties to the Chemical Weapons
Convention. We must be absolutely sure that dangerous
toxic substances do not fall into the hands of terrorists.
