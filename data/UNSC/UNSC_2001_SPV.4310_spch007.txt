Mr. Neewoor (Mauritius): I should like to thank
Mr. Guehenno for his very comprehensive and
informative briefing on the current situation in Ethiopia
and Eritrea. We appreciate it, especially in the light of
the positive developments on which he has reported.
We welcome the establishment of the Temporary
Security Zone (TSZ), as announced by the United
Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE)
yesterday. The establishment of the TSZ, which marks
the formal separation of the Ethiopian and Eritrean
forces is indeed a very important milestone in progress
towards the resolution of the conflict. The signing of
the agreement between UNMEE and the Eritrean
commissioner for coordination with UNMEE, outlining
the rules of interaction between United Nations
peacekeepers and Eritrean law enforcement and
security elements, is of great significance in ensuring
the complete freedom of movement of UNMEE.

We fully support this important progress, which is
so vital for the successful fulfilment of the mandate of
UNMEE. We regret, however, that the subject of a
direct air link between Addis Ababa and Asmara is still
unresolved. We would like to call upon both sides to
address this issue without further delay, as it interferes
with the freedom of movement of UNMEE.

We commend and thank Ambassador Legwaila
for all the efforts that he has undertaken to resolve the
impasse that had delayed the establishment of the TSZ.
We are hopeful that, given the recent developments, the
work of the Boundary Commission will gain
momentum.

Finally, I would like to appeal to both Ethiopia
and Eritrea to address, on humanitarian grounds and
without further delay, the question of internally
displaced persons and refugees. We believe that this is
a very important issue for the final resolution of the
difficulties between the two countries.
