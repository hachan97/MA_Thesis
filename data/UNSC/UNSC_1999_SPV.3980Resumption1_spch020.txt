Mr. Fedotov (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian): With regard to the discussion which arose
late in the meeting, I should like to reaffirm several key
elements of our position.

First, Russia has consistently supported the full
implementation of the Security Council resolutions on
Iraq, which have paved the way for a durable post-crisis
settlement in the Persian Gulf.

Secondly, the so-called non-fly zones, to which
reference has been made, have nothing to do with the
resolutions of the Security Council. The ongoing
systematic bombings in those zones, as well as the
foreign invasion of the northern part of Iraq, are causing
us deep concern. We call upon all concerned to put an
end to acts which run counter to the fundamental
principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the
norms of international law and which, inter alia, lead to
the death of civilians. Now as never before, we need a
responsible approach which would create a favourable
atmosphere for the work now going on in the Security
Council to resolve the Iraq problem.

Thirdly, meetings such as this one today are aimed
at enhancing the transparency of the work of the Security
Council and at making it possible for a broad range of
countries to bring their evaluations and ideas to Council
members. These evaluations may differ from the views of
certain Council members, but we see nothing bad in that.
It is the price we pay for the openness of our work.
