The President: I welcome the presence of the
Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, at this meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2003/1107, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Bulgaria, Chile, Guinea,
Spain, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, and the United States of America.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Guinea, Mexico, Pakistan,
Russian Federation, Spain, Syrian Arab Republic,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, United States of America

The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1518 (2003).

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
