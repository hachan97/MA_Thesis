The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.

I should like to draw the attention of the members
of the Council to the special report of the Secretary-
General on Somalia, which has been issued as
document S/2012/74.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2012/104, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.

A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Azerbaijan, China, Colombia, France, Germany,
Guatemala, India, Morocco, Pakistan, Portugal,
Russian Federation, South Africa, Togo, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America

The President (spoke in French): There were
15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 2036 (2012).

I shall now give the floor to members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
