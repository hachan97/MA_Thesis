Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
listened attentively to the briefing by Ms. Bensouda.
The new Government of Libya has been established,
signifying a new step in Libya's political transition
process, which China welcomes. The formation of the
new Government has paved the way for the general
election next year. It is a positive indicator of the
Libyan people's efforts to achieve stability, to proceed
with national reconciliation and to undertake economic
reconstruction.

China hopes that Libya's new Government can
rally the entire nation and proceed actively with the
political transition process, based on the road map
and the timetable outlined for the transition, with the
goal of achieving long-term stability and prosperity.
The international community should continue to assist
Libya's new Government and its people in those efforts.

China's position on the International Criminal
Court (ICC) remains unchanged. We hope that the
relevant actions of the ICC, in accordance with the
Security Council's resolutions, can play a constructive
role in promoting Libya's transition and reconstruction
processes.
