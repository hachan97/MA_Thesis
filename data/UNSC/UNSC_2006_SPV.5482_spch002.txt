The President: I should like to inform the
members of the Council that I have received letters
from the representatives of Belgium, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and Finland, in which they
request to be invited to participate in the consideration
of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity
with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of
the Council, to invite those representatives to
participate in the consideration of the item, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Cools,
(Belgium), Mr. Ileka (Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Ms. Lintonen (Finland) took the seats
reserved for them at the side of the Council
Chamber.
