The President: I thank the Minister for External
Relations of Angola for the kind words he addressed to the
Canadian delegation.

The next speaker on my list is the Minister for
Foreign Affairs of Burkina Faso, Mr. Youssouf Ouedraogo.
I welcome him, and I invite him to take a seat at the
Council table and to make his statement.
