The President (spoke in Chinese): There are no
more names inscribed on the list of speakers. The
Security Council has thus concluded this stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

As this is the last meeting of the Council for the
month of November, I would like to express the sincere
appreciation of the delegation of the China to the
members of the Council, especially my colleagues the
Permanent Representatives, their respective staffs and
the secretariat of the Council for all the support they
have given to us.

It has indeed been a busy month, and one in
which we rallied to consensus on several important
issues within our purview. We could not have done it
alone and without the hard work, support and positive
contributions of every Mission and the representatives
of the Secretariat, as well as the interpreters, translators,
conference officers and sound engineers. As we end
our presidency, I know I speak on behalf of the entire
Council in wishing the delegation of France good luck
in the month of December.

The meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.
