Mr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We, too, would like to thank the Secretary-
General for the statement that he made.

The Russian delegation, guided by its consistent
support for the peacekeeping activity of the
international community in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
voted in favour of the draft resolution in order to
ensure the implementation of the Dayton Agreements.
We regret that the draft resolution was not adopted, for
reasons which, as has been noted today, are not directly
related to the settlement in Bosnia. The reasons relate
to the problem of the relationship between the United
States and the International Criminal Court. We
understand those problems. Over the past few days,
working together with other members of the Security
Council, we have made real efforts to try to find a
solution within the norms of current international law
that would also meet the concerns of the United States.
We believe it necessary for the Security Council to
continue its efforts in order to find consensus very
soon.
