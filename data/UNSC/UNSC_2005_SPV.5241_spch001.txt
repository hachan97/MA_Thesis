The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the

Interim Force in Lebanon, document S/2005/460*.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2005/491*, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by France, Greece, the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland

Lebanon; and documents S/2005/312, S/2005/352 and
S/2005/423, which contain letters from Israel.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote of the draft resolution

shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.

agenda.
