Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I know time marches on; I will be brief. I have a practice in the Security Council of defending the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) here at the United Nations whenever the Syrian representative attacks it. I wish to point out that, on this occasion, the same will apply. OCHA and the United Nations do a fantastic job in the most difficult of circumstances on the ground. I heard what the Syrian representative said about how much aid the Syrian authorities deliver to their own people, and we will be pursuing that in future meetings. I will take it as a commitment from the Syrian authorities to allowing non-governmental organizations access into Syria and permitting them to distribute humanitarian assistance to the people most in need. We will be holding him to account with regard to his remarks. The meeting rose at 7.05 p.m.
