Mr. Llorentty Soliz (Plurinational State ofBolivia) (spoke in Spanish): This meeting is an interesting one
from a variety of perspectives. One is that Lenin and
Marx, two anti-imperialists, have been invoked more
than once. What we have seen today is related to that
topic. It is a fact that all empires are under the illusion
that they are morally superior to the rest of us, that they
believe themselves to be exceptional and indispensable
and that they are above the law. In this, as in other
cases, they do not seek to advance democracy or
freedom, but rather ultimately to expand their power
and domination worldwide.

What we have seen today is a sad reflection ofwhat
is happening on the battlefield in Syria and of those
interests. I would like to echo the words ofthe Swedish
Ambassador in urging the Security Council not to rest
until we are united and can reach consensus, if indeed
we believe in the purposes and principles ofthe Charter
of the United Nations. It is the Charter, and whether the
members of the Council can fulfil it, that is ultimately
at stake. One of our responsibilities under it is to refrain
from taking unilateral action. We hope that principle
will be honoured.
