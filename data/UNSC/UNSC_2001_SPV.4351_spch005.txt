The President (spoke in Chinese): I thank
Mr. Ramos-Horta for his kind words addressed to my
country. After the independence of East Timor, the
international community will certainly warmly
welcome this newborn country. We wish you excellent
results in all areas, including the Olympics in 2008.

I shall now give the floor to the members of the
Council who wish to make comments or ask questions.
So many members of the Council raised their hands at
the beginning of the meeting to indicate that they
wanted to speak that it will probably not be possible to
please everyone with the order of the list of speakers. I
ask for members' forgiveness, and for their
understanding of the difficulties faced by the
Secretariat and the President.
