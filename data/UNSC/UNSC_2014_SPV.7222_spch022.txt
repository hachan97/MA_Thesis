Mr. Hmoud (Jordan): I want to respond to the
inquiry by the Permanent Representative of the
Russian Federation and to assure him that Jordan will
be discussing with Council members proposals by
the League of Arab States to end the conflict and the
attack on the Palestinian people in Gaza. The League
has given the mandate to Jordan to do so, as well as
the discretion on when to present the proposals. The
goal should be to ensure effective action and fruitful
efforts on the ground to end the conflict. It is in that
context that we will confer with Council members and
circulate a draft document later today for members'
views. I thank Ambassador Churkin for his concern
and attention to the matter.
