Mr. Bessho (Japan): Japan supported and
co-sponsored the draft resolution (S/2017/172) proposed
by France, the United Kingdom and the United States.
We firmly believe that the Security Council needs to
show its shared determination that the use of chemical
weapons is not permissible under any circumstances,
and that the Council will hold accountable those who
are responsible.

Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the
United Nations, in resolution 2118 (2013) we as a
Council decided to impose measures in the event
of any use of chemical weapons in Syria by anyone.
This is the starting point. Then the Joint Investigative
Mechanism (JIM) was established and its mandate
renewed unanimously. The JIM. drew conclusions from
its impartial, objective and independent investigation.
In the view of Japan, it is our primary responsibility
to implement what we have decided as a Council.
Regrettably, today the proposed draft resolution was
not adopted. However, I believe and hope there is unity
inside the Council on the necessity to hold accountable
those who are responsible for the use of chemical
weapons. The Council needs to continue to explore
ensuring accountability.

As for the issue of timing, we heard an argument
that this moment is not opportune in the light of the
political process in Geneva. There is no question about
the Council's unanimous support for the political
process led by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-
General for Syria, Mr. Staffan de Mistura. However, it
is not a question of whether the timing is good or not for
the Council to take measures to ensure accountability
for the use of chemical weapons.
