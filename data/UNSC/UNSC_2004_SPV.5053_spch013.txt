Mr. Mercado (Philippines): My delegation voted
in favour of resolution 1566 (2004) because we believe
that this resolution will make a positive contribution to
the resolve of the Council to fight against the menace
of terrorism. The terrorist bombing that took place in
Egypt yesterday underscores the importance of today's
action by the Council. We condemn that terrorist
bombing and extend our deepest sympathy to the
relatives of the victims.

We are gratified that the Council achieved unity
in the adoption of resolution 1566 (2004), which
reaffirms the belief of every member of the Council
that criminal attacks against civilians are never
justified, for any reason. This resolution in no way
overturns the right to self-determination under the
Charter. Likewise, legitimate acts against foreign
occupation and alien domination are not thwarted in
the least by the Council's adoption of this resolution.

My delegation looks forward to participating
actively in the work of the working group that will
discuss and make recommendations on practical
measures to be imposed on individuals, groups or
entities involved in terrorism.
