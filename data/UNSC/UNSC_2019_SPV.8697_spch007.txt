Mrs. Gueguen (France) (spoke in French): France
deeply regrets the fact that the draft resolution set out
by the humanitarian co-penholders and supported by
13 of the 15 members of the Security Council was not
adopted because Russia, followed by China, decided
to exercise its veto and to jeopardize the delivery of
international humanitarian aid to Syria and the survival
of millions of people. It is irresponsible and sinister.

Cross-border humanitarian assistance is of vital
importance for the four million Syrian people who
depend on it. Must we recall that today there is no
alternative to cross-border humanitarian assistance to
deliver vital assistance every day to the hundreds of
thousands of people in need in the regions concerned,
particularly Idlib, because the Syrian regime continues
to weaponize humanitarian assistance for political
purposes and to prevent all those who suffer and are in
need from having equal assistance.

France calls on all members ofthe Security Council
to demonstrate unity and responsibility to pursue
dialogue to renew this vital mechanism, as requested
by the Secretary-General, humanitarian agencies and
the countries of the region. A renewal for only six
months would make no sense in terms of planning
humanitarian operations, which need predictability and
stability in order to be prepared and conducted in an
effective and long-lasting manner.
With respect to the border crossings, I recall
the crucial importance of Al-Yarubiyah, providing
a route for 40 per cent of the medicine required for
humanitarian operations in the north-east. The Iraqi
authorities are also in favour of keeping it open. We
are aware there are political and military issues at the
present stage of the conflict in Syria, but politicizing
and exploiting humanitarian aid must end. We must
not hold the Syrian people hostage and let us get back
to work.
