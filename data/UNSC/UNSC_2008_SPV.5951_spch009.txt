Mr. La Yifan (China) (spoke in Chinese): First
of all, I welcome the representative of Georgia to this
meeting. The current situation in South Ossetia,
Georgia, is deeply worrisome. China is gravely
concerned about the military conflict and about the
escalation of the conflict in the region. The first
imperative is to cease hostilities and, at the same time,
to exercise restraint and avoid any action that may lead
to an escalation of tension and harm regional peace and
stability.

On 31 October 2007, at its sixty-second session,
the General Assembly unanimously adopted its
resolution 62/4, which relates to the Olympic Truce
during this year's Olympic Games. In a few hours, the
XXIX summer Olympics will be opening in Beijing.
China shares the Secretary-General's wish for the
parties concerned to comply with the Olympic Truce
resolution. The Security Council and the international
community should encourage the parties to cease the
hostilities without delay, resume dialogue and make
determined efforts to resolve their dispute in a peaceful
manner.
