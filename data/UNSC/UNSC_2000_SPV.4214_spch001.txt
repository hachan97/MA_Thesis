The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

In a letter dated 27 October 2000 addressed to the
Secretary-General, the President of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia submitted the application of his
country for membership in the United Nations. That
letter has been circulated in document S/2000/1043.

Under the provisions of rule 59 of the provisional
rules of procedure of the Security Council, unless the
Council decides otherwise, an application for
membership shall be referred by the President of the
Council to the Committee on the Admission of New
Members. Accordingly, unless I hear a proposal to the
contrary, I shall refer the application of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia to the Committee on the
Admission of New Members for examination and
report.

As I hear no objection, it is so decided.

I would propose that the Committee on the
Admission of New Members meet today, 31 October, at
12.20 p.m., in Conference Room 7, to consider the
application of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for
membership in the United Nations.

The meeting rose at 12.20 p.rn.
