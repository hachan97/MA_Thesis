Mr. Bessho (Japan): Japan did not support the draft
resolution initially submitted by Russian Federation
(S/2017/968) because we do not support its assessment of
the past work of the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative
Mechanism (JIM).

While we take note of Russia's willingness to
consider renewing the mandate of the JIM. and Russia's
wish to improve the work of the JIM, we believe that
the best way to keep the JIM. in operation was described
in the draft resolution submitted by the United States
(S/2017/962), which failed to be adopted. There is
no changing the fact that the Council is ultimately
responsible for ensuring accountability for the use of
chemical weapons. Again, I sincerely urge all members
of the Council not to abandon our efforts and to continue
discussions in order to find a way to prevent the further
use of chemical weapons and not to allow impunity.
