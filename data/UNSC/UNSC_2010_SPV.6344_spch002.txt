Mr. Takasu (Japan): This is the fourteenth
90-day report in accordance with paragraph 18 (h) of
resolution 1737 (2006). The report covers the period
from 5 March to 28 June 2010, during which time the
Committee held no meetings but conducted its work
using the silence procedure.

At the outset, I would like to recall that, less than
three weeks ago, by its resolution 1929 (2010), of
9 June, the Security Council adopted additional
measures relating to the Islamic Republic of Iran.

As outlined in the resolution, the Council decided
that the mandate of the Committee shall also apply to
the measures decided in resolution 1929 (2010) and
that the Committee shall intensify its efforts to promote
the full implementation of resolutions 1737 (2006),
1747 (2007), 1803 (2008) and 1929 (2010), including
through a work programme to be submitted to the
Council within 45 days of the adoption of resolution
1929 (2010) - that is, by 24 July 2010. The Council
also established, for an initial period of one year and
under the direction of the Committee, a panel of
experts to carry out certain tasks, as specified. The
Committee stands ready to carry out the tasks that the
Council has assigned to it in this resolution.

During the reporting period, the Committee
responded to a written request for guidance from a
Member State in connection with the disposal of arms-
related materiel found onboard the vessel M/V Hansa
2

India that was being transferred in violation of
paragraph 5 of resolution 1747 (2007). I wish to note
here that, in paragraph 16 of resolution 1929 (2010),
the Council further outlined the responsibilities of
States should they be faced with a similar situation and
clarified that they are both authorized and obligated to
seize and dispose of items being supplied, sold,
transferred or exported in violation of the relevant
resolutions on Iran.

The Committee also received further information
from another Member State on the activities of the
M/V F rancop. Members will recall that, in my two
preceding reports, I informed the Council of the reports
of arms-related materiel found onboard both vessels in
violation of paragraph 5 of resolution 1747 (2007) and
of the action taken by the Committee as a result.

The Committee received one notification from a
Member State with reference to paragraph 5 of
resolution 1737 (2006), concerning the delivery of
items for use in the nuclear power plant in Bushehr,
Iran. The Committee is also considering a letter that it
received from a Member State about an intended
delivery of items for use in that plant. The Committee
received additional specific information on a prior
general notification that had been submitted by a
Member State pursuant to paragraph 15 of resolution
1737 (2006), in connection with the unfreezing of
funds to make payments due under contracts entered
into prior to the listing of an entity.

Furthermore, a communication was received from
a Member State providing additional information on an
individual whose name had previously been provided
to the Committee by another Member State in
accordance with the requirement for vigilance in
relation to travel, due to its similarity with the name of
a designated individual. On the basis of the additional
information, it was confirmed that the person whose
name was initially provided was not the same person as
the one designated by the Council. The Committee will
be responding to a query from a Member State seeking
confirmation that certain individuals and entities have
not been designated either by the Council or by the
Committee as subject to the travel ban and/or assets
freeze.

Finally, with regard to reporting by States on the
implementation of all relevant measures set out in
resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007) and 1803 (2008),
the figures are: 92 reports under resolution 1737
10-42528

(2006), 79 reports under resolution 1747 (2007) and
68 reports under resolution 1803 (2008). The
Committee expects to receive implementation reports
pursuant to paragraph 31 of resolution 1929 (2010) in
the coming days, and strongly encourages all Member
States to submit those reports within the requested time
frame.
