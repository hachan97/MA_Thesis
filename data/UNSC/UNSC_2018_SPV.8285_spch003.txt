Mr. Orrenius Skau (Sweden): The parliamentary
elections in May were an important democratic step
forward for Iraq. The decision to recount all votes means
that the process is not yet at an end and that the United
Nations has a central role to play in support of that
critical exercise. Once formed, a challenging to-do list
awaits the new Government. A strong, well-resourced
United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI),
with the capacity to assist and advise the Government
as it works to dress those complex challenges and to be
able to provide good offices, is perhaps more relevant
than ever.

I would like to thank the Iraqi delegation for
the excellent cooperation in the process of drafting
resolution 2421 (2018), and the United States, as
penholder, for its work on the resolution. We especially
appreciate their efforts to streamline and update
the text.

There are two areas where we feel that UNAMI's
mandate has been particularly strengthened: on the
role of women and the situation of children. First,
we welcome the inclusion, for the first time, of an
operative women and peace and security component
in UNAMI's mandate, which brings UNAMI into
line with other missions. That will allow the Mission
to further enhance its efforts to ensure women's full
and meaningful participation in the political process.
Secondly, we welcome the inclusion of the issue of
strengthening child protection in Iraq, with a focus
on the rehabilitation and reintegration of children.
Successful reintegration is in the best interests of
children, but it is also critical for reconciliation.

The resolution adopted today not only renews but
improves and modernizes the mandate of UNAMI. We
look forward to its full implementation.

The meeting rose at 10.10 a.m.
