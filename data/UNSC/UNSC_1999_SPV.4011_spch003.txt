The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of
Turkey, in which he requests to be invited to participate
in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Voral (Turkey)
took the seat reserved for him at the side of the
Council Chamber.

The President: It is my understanding that the
Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft
resolution before it (S/1999/691). Unless I hear any
objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the voting.
