Mr. Ndong Mba (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in Spanish): On 14 March, when we met in this Chamber at
the request of our colleagues from the United Kingdom
on the same issue of the chemical attack in Salisbury,
United Kingdom (S/PV.8203), the first thing we did was
to condemn the perpetration of that attack and to stand
in solidarity with the victims and their families and
with the Government of the United Kingdom. Today we
begin our statement by reiterating the same message
of condemnation.

Equatorial Guinea is closely following developments
in relation to the incident involving the use of a
chemical agent in Salisbury and hopes that the ongoing
investigations will fully clarify the incident and that
they will be comprehensive, fair and independent and
in accordance with relevant international standards and
procedures. The conclusions must be made public, and
those responsible must be brought to justice.

Equatorial Guinea reiterates the hope that the
relevant parties, the United Kingdom and the Russian
Federation, aware of their great responsibility as
permanent members of the Security Council, will set a
credible example for the international community of the
peaceful settlement of disputes. It is important that at a
historic and crucial time like this, when the relevance
of the international structures for harmonizing
coexistence - which both parties have worked so
hard to establish and preserve - is constantly being
questioned, London and Moscow use their long-
standing maturity and international political experience
to manage this new crisis in a moderate, suitable and
reasoned manner through direct contacts and in close
collaboration with the international legal instruments
and entities established for this purpose, such as the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
We hope that this diplomatic crisis, which has escalated,
can also be defused.

Equatorial Guinea opposes the development,
production, stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical
weapons, as these activities contravene the Chemical
Weapons Convention and the purposes and principles
of the Charter of the United Nations, and we advocate
for their total and complete prohibition and destruction.
