Mr. Valdivieso (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I
should like to begin by welcoming Mr. Kerim, Minister
for Foreign Affairs of the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, and expressing the support of my country
for the quest for a solution to the problems that have
brought us together today.

Colombia condemns all forms of violence; we
cannot accept any justification for it. We therefore join
with those who have already condemned the acts that
have taken place in recent days near the town of
Tanusevci, on the border between Kosovo and
Macedonia. My country believes that respect for the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of States is one of
the most important principles of international relations.
We therefore reject the continuing threats by extremists
to the territorial integrity of Macedonia.

We support the request of the Minister with
regard to the need for the Kosovo Force to act
immediately to halt such terrorist activities and prevent
them from spilling over to the rest of the country and
the region. As the Minister rightly pointed out, it is
necessary for the international community to continue
to maintain a meaningful presence in the area so as to
avoid a deterioration of the situation and contribute to
the restoration of trust between the parties. We must
spare no effort to find a political way out of this crisis,
which in our view is the only viable solution.

I should like to conclude by expressing the
support of my delegation for the presidential statement
that we will adopt after this meeting.
