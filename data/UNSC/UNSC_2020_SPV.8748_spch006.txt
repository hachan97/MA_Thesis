Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation voted in favour of resolution 2535 (2020), submitted by the Dominican Republic and France, on youth, peace and security. The negotiations on the resolution were far from easy and showed that there were conceptual differences among delegations on the role and objectives of the Security Council when it comes to youth, taking into account the specific mandate of the Security Council itself. Despite that, the co-penholders tried to find consensus solutions and managed to strike a balance among the wide range of views of the members of the Security Council, which in turn made it possible for us to have a unanimous vote on the resolution. We expect that future discussions of youth issues in the Security Council will be comprehensive in nature. As we move forward the issue of youth participation in the entire range of peace processes, including peace settlements and peacebuilding, it is important to bear in mind that what is needed is to eliminate the obstacles thereto, including by introducing preventive measures with respect to the spread of extremist ideologies and terrorism among young people. The meeting rose at 10.35 a.m.
