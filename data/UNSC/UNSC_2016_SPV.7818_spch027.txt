Mr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): As regards the situation in Crimea, I note that
it was not the peaceful citizens of Crimea who refused
the water from the Dniepr; it was a purposeful act
on the part of the Kyiv authorities, which turned the
humanitarian situation basically into a catastrophe. The
water blockade did not stop there; it was followed by
blockades of energy and food.

As regards the situation in the Donbas, in the most
recent report of the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights, it is stated very clearly

that, as a result of military activities, the infrastructure
is suffering, including through interrupted access to
water. The report appeals to all sides, including the
armed force of Ukraine, in all circumstances to ensure
respect for the provisions of international humanitarian
law and to avoid damaging objects indispensable to
the survival of the civilian population, including water
filtration facilities.
