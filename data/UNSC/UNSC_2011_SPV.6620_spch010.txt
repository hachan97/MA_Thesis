Mr. Osorio (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): In
recent months, the Libyan people have made immense
sacrifices in order to achieve their aspirations for a
democratic Libya whose potential prosperity will
benefit all Libyan citizens. A new stage in the history
of the country has begun and a reform process
launched that is aimed at guaranteeing the rights and
meeting the needs of its people, which have for so long
been denied them.

Today, when the General Assembly recognized
the new representative of Libya and the Security
Council has adopted a resolution marking the first step
on the return to normalcy, is the time to renew our
comprehensive assistance to the Libyan authorities in
order to achieve a lasting peace through reconciliation,
reconstruction, economic recovery and the onset of all
necessary reform to promote the establishment of
democracy and development in that country.

That is why, in adopting resolution 2009 (2011)
pursuant to the principles and responsibilities
enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in
full respect and promotion of the sovereignty,
independence, territorial integrity and national unity of
Libya, we fully support the establishment of the United
Nations Support Mission in Libya, which, under the
principle of national ownership, will extend its full
cooperation in order to fulfil the priorities established
by the Libyan people themselves.
