The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2001/1016, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations.

I should also like to draw the attention of the
members of the Council to the following documents:
S/2001/979, letter dated 15 October 2001 from
Belgium addressed to the Secretary-General; and
S/2001/1013, letter dated 25 October 2001 from South
Africa addressed to the President of the Security
Council.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/2001/1016) before it. IfI hear no objection, I shall
put the draft resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:

Bangladesh, China, Colombia, France, Ireland,

Jamaica, Mali, Mauritius, Norway, Russian

Federation, Singapore, Tunisia, Ukraine, United

Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,

The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1375 (2001).

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
