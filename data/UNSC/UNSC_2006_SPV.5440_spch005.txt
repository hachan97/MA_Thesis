Mr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): My
delegation voted in favour of draft resolution
S/2006/298. The position of Qatar is firm in its respect
for the sovereignty, political independence and
territorial integrity of Lebanon. Our position calls for
full respect for Lebanese efforts to resolve difficult
national problems through the Lebanese national
dialogue. In that regard, my delegation stresses that it
welcomes that dialogue and that it encourages all the
parties to strive to make progress concerning relations
between Lebanon and Syria.

We affirm that, ultimately, the depth of historical
relations and the common geography of the two
neighbouring countries cannot permit any tension to
overcome the friendly relations between the two
countries. Parties to the national dialogue were
unanimous in calling for positive and friendly relations
between the two States, based on mutual respect.
Furthermore, the high-level committees formed jointly
by the two countries indicate the mutual respect
between the two countries and their efforts to resolve
all bilateral issues between them in a manner that does
not touch upon the sovereignty of either.

On another front, we regret that the resolution did
not mention any breaches by Israel of the Blue Line.
These are among the elements that are hampering the
full implementation of resolution 1559 (2004), not to
mention the fact that they are a breach of Lebanon's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, as the Secretary-
General has stated in his reports to the Security
Council.
