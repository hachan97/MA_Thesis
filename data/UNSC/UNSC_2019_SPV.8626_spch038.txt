The President (spoke in Russian): I shall now make
a further statement in my capacity as the representative
of the Russian Federation.

Since we are having a discussion on this topic, on
behalf of the Russian Federation, I want to say that we
express our full solidarity with China's position.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs
of Kazakhstan.
