Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations

prior consultations.

I should like to inform the Council that, in my
capacity as President of the Council, I have met with
the representatives of the parties, who have confirmed
to me that they maintain their well-known positions
vis-a-vis the item on the Council's agenda. On the
basis of those meetings, as President, with the consent
of the members of the Council, I have drawn the
conclusion that the Council can proceed to take a
decision on the draft resolution before it.

If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:

Jamaica, Malaysia, Mali, Namibia, Netherlands,
Russian Federation, Tunisia, Ukraine, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,

The President (spoke in Russian): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1331 (2000).

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
