The President: I thank Mrs. Ogata for her
comprehensive briefing and her intellectually stimulating
presentation.

 

I shall now give the floor to the members of the
Council.

Since we are embarking on a new procedure today, I
want to remind colleagues that, since this is a briefing, we
will be opening the floor for questions and brief comments,
as opposed to our usual statements.
