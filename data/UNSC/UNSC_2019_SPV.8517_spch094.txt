Mr. Seifi Pargou (Islamic Republic ofIran): Today
the Saudi delegation made unfounded allegations
against my country that I do not want to dignify with an
answer. We are not surprised to hear such fabrications,
as they are in line with Israel's approach to diverting
attention from this meeting's agenda, which is Israel's
occupation of Palestine. They make these accusations
to distract from the reality of Saudi's relations with
extremists and terrorists. Saudi Arabia's Wahhabi
ideology is the ideology of major terrorist groups
around the world, just as its petrodollars are the main
source of funding for global terrorist activities. That
is what its patron, the United States, has repeatedly
stated. The Saudis are therefore the founding fathers of
terrorist groups, ideologically and financially.

As Saudi Arabia pays to remove its name from
the list of child killers in the United Nations, it is also
trying to portray itself, by making large contributions
to United Nations counter-terrorism mechanisms, as a
country that is combating terrorists. However, neither
its fabrications against others nor such contributions
can change the reality of deeds such as its cold-blooded
murder and dismemberment of Saudi journalists. And it
should stop beheading innocent Saudi minorities on the
pretext of fighting terrorism. The reality is that they are
brutally killed only because they are minorities.

Last but not least, with regard to the Israeli
delegation's accusation and nonsensical statement, the
item on this meeting's agenda is the Middle East and
Israel's occupation of Palestine. Israel has to answer
for that. In its short lifespan, it has already waged 15
wars in our region and has invaded all of its neighbours,
without exception. It must be brought to justice and
held accountable.
