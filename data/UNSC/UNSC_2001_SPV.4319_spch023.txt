The President: I want to note that we are now at
1 o'clock, and I intend to continue this meeting without
a break. I ask that the remaining speakers be brief so
that we can give time to the Secretariat. I commit
myself to greatly shortening the statement that I was
going to make at the end of this meeting in my national
capacity.
