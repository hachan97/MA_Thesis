Mr. Laro (Nigeria): I thank the Chair of the
Committee established pursuant to resolution 1737
(2006) for his presentation of the 90-day report of
the Committee. I also commend him for his astute
leadership of the Committee and the Panel of Experts
for their hard work.

We have carefully read the report of the Panel
of Experts (S/2014/394, annex) and take note of their
assessment that a comprehensive solution to the
negotiations between Iran and the E3+3 is within reach.
The observation of the International Atomic Energy
Agency that Iran has fulfilled its voluntary measures
agreed to under the joint plan of action is significant.

We also note from the report of the Panel of
Experts that there is a degree of uncertainty on the part
of States concerning the status of obligations regarding
procurement related to uranium enrichment by Iran.
There is also the challenge of identifying dual-use

items that fall below established control thresholds.
The report indicates that it is increasingly difficult for
States to identify links between below-threshold items
and prohibited end users or end uses in Iran. The report
attributes this to more sophisticated procurement
strategies on the part of Iran, which allows it to conceal
procurement. That situation calls for more clarity on
below-threshold items, and we urge the Committee
to look into that with a view to providing guidance to
States.

On a positive note, we welcome the assessment
by several States that there has been a decrease in
the number of detected attempts by Iran to procure
items for prohibited programmes since mid-2013. The
Panel of Experts believes that this may reflect the new
political environment in Iran, as well as progress in
the negotiations with the E3+3. We shall continue to
monitor the situation as we look forward to a successful
conclusion of the negotiations within the agreed
deadline of 20 July set by the joint plan of action.
