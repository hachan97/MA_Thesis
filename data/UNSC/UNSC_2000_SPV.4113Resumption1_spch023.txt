The President: There are no further speakers
inscribed on my list.

In prior consultations, the Council decided to
convene another open meeting to give an opportunity to
the larger membership of the United Nations to participate
in this issue. I will keep myself open to that on the
understanding that if there are needs expressed and
requests by the Member States to speak, then maybe we
will schedule such a meeting.

In any case, the Security Council will remain seized
of the matter.

The meeting rose at 5.30 pm.
