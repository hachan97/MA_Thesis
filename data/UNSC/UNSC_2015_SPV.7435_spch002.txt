Mr. Ibrahim (Malaysia): My delegation takes the
floor to explain its vote or resolution 2218 (2015), which
the Security Council has just adopted.

We would like to underscore Malaysia's full
support for the efforts of the United Nations Mission
for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), as
well as those ofthe Secretary-General and his Personal
Envoy, towards finding a solution to the question
of Western Sahara. We also support the Secretary-
General's recommendation to extend the mandate of
MINURSO until 30 April 2016. In that regard, we call
for the parties to the dispute to continue negotiations
under the auspices of the Secretary-General, in a
constructive manner, with a view to achieving a
mutually acceptable political solution to all, as well
as ensuring an improvement in the well-being of the
people of Western Sahara.

We remain hopeful that, in future, a more
transparent and inclusive consultation process that
takes into account the Views of all Council members
could be undertaken. That would certainly contribute
immensely to our collective efforts to find a mutually
acceptable solution to the question of Western Sahara.
