Mr. Cevik (Turkey): 1 will be very brief. I do not
want to take up the valuable time of the Council on these
baseless accusations. But I would make three points.

First, with regard to the Al-Nusra Front and
Daesh, those two organizations have been on Turkey's
terrorism list since 2013. The track record of Turkey on
fighting terrorism is very well-known.

With regard to the accusations by the Syrian
regime, I would like to point out that barrel bombs are
being used all over Syria - although the regime denies
it.

Lastly, I would like to draw the attention of the
entire international community to the fact that the
terrorist Abdullah Ocalan was known to be in Syria for
many years up until 1998. When it comes to harbouring
terrorists, I think the facts are clear in the eyes of the
whole world.

The meeting rose at 1.50 pm.
