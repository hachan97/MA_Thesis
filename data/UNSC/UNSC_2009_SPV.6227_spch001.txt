Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of the Sudan in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item

practice I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item without the right to vote, in

Union-United Nations Chief Mediator for Darfur.

It is so decided.
