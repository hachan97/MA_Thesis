Mr. Ja'afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): In recent years, the Syrian Government and its allies have declared 17 truces, which are something like ceasefires - 17 times and every time, just hours after the truce has been declared, it has been violated by the militants upon the instructions of their handlers, be they from Ankara, Doha or elsewhere. Therefore, I raised the question based on our experience following 17 truces - meaning ceasefires - all of which were violated by the cannibals from the other side, who were bombarding Aleppo on a daily basis, killing dozens of civilians. No one in the Security Council called for an emergency meeting to discuss the bombardment of Aleppo by terrorists. When terrorists bombard Aleppo, that is acceptable, but when the Syrian Army bombards Idlib to eliminate the terrorists who are bombarding Aleppo, it is impermissible. In any case, we opened three humanitarian corridors over two months ago to allow our civilian nationals to leave Idlib for safe areas under the control of the Syrian Government. The Syrian Red Crescent and our Russian allies are on the ground at these three humanitarian corridors to observe what is taking place. But terrorists and terrorist groups in Idlib have not allowed civiliansto leave and have killed anyone who tried to do so. They have killed dozens of our people trying to leave Idlib. At your request, Mr. President, I do not want to prolong this discussion. As I said, however, if you and others want to hear answers to the questions raised, I am ready to do so.
