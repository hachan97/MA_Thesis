The President: I thank the representative of Egypt
for the kind words he addressed to me.

I should like to inform the Council that I have
received a letter from the representatives of Kuwait and
Peru, in which they request to be invited to participate in
the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives to
participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Abulhasan
(Kuwait) and Mr. Guille'n (Peru) took the seats
reserved for them at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The President: The next speaker is the
representative of Peru. I invite him to take a seat at the
Council table and to make his statement.
