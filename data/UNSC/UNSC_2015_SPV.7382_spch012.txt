Mr. Barros Melet (Chile) (spoke in Spanish):
The delegation of Chile is grateful for the initiative
of the United Kingdom and Jordan in preparing and
introducing the timely resolution 2201 (2015). We
appreciate the effort made in the Security Council to
agree on a text that reflects a firm common position in
the face of the urgent issue of Yemen.

Despite the coup d'etat, it is now time for the parties
in Yemen to assume their responsibilities and relaunch
the dialogue. More than ever, we urge all the parties
to avoid unilateral actions and to speed up inclusive
negotiations, facilitated by the United Nations, with a
View to moving ahead with the political transition.

We demand the early and safe release of President
Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour, Prime Minister
Khaled Mahfoudh Abdullah Bahah and all political
leaders under arbitrary house arrest.
