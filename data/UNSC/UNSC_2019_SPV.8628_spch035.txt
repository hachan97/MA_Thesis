Mr. Al-Mouallimi (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): I had not hoped to hear the representative of
Iran to resort to his tired polemics and false accusations
about the role played by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
in the region.

Who supported incidents of terrorism in Argentina,
the Arabian Gulf, Syria, Europe, Berlin and elsewhere?
All these incidents were the work of the ultimate
terrorist State, the Iranian regime. Now we hear the
representative of that country talking about the role
of my country in this regard and decry the situation
of our brethren in Yemen. He applies the famous Arab
proverb about those who accuse others of what they
are doing. This regime is shedding crocodile tears for
Yemen while it has offered that country nothing but
bullets, destruction and damage. That is also exactly
what it has offered Syria, where it has sought to spread
sectarianism and terrorism. In Iraq, the Iranian regime
continues to destabilize that deep-rooted Arab country.

I therefore call on the representative of Iran to
refrain from his silliness. He knows fully well that his
accusations are false.
