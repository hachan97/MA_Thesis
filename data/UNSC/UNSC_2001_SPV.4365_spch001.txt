The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now resume its consideration of the item
on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Following consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council welcomes the
success of the preparatory meeting of the Inter-
Congolese Dialogue, held in Gaborone on 20-24
August 2001.

"The Security Council reiterates its strong
support for the Inter-Congolese Dialogue and for
the efforts of the Facilitator and his team in the
field. It calls on all the Congolese parties to
further cooperate with each other and the
Facilitator in the constructive spirit of Gaborone
to ensure the successful outcome of the Inter-
Congolese Dialogue starting on 15 October 2001,
in Addis Ababa.

"The Security Council stresses the
importance for the Dialogue to be free from
outside interference, open, representative and
inclusive, and emphasizes the need to ensure
adequate representation of Congolese women in
the process.

"The Security Council encourages donors to
provide further support to the Facilitator for the
Inter-Congolese Dialogue and, in due course, the
process of implementing a new political
dispensation in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo.

"The Security Council urges all the parties
to the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement to press
forward with the full and early implementation of
that Agreement, including disarmament,
demobilization, reintegration, repatriation and
resettlement of the armed groups, and the
withdrawal of foreign forces."

This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under the symbol
S/PRST/2001/22.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Council will remain seized of the matter.

The meeting rose at 6.50 pm.
