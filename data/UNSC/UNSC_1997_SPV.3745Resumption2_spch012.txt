Mr. Valle (Brazil): I would like, first of all, to
congratulate you, Ambassador Wlosowicz, on your
assumption of the presidency of the Council for the
month of March. We are confident that under your skilled
guidance the work of the Security Council will be
conducted with great efficiency. Let me also take this
opportunity to thank your predecessor, Ambassador
Mahugu, for the competence with which he presided over
the Council during the month of February.

In recent years a lot has been done to bring "peace to
the Middle East From the Madrid Conference of 1991 to
the Declaration of Principles signed in Washington in
Security Council 374Sth meeting (Resumption 2)
Fifty~second year 6 Match 1997

 

1993, from the Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the
Jericho Area of 1994 to the Agreement on the Preparatory
Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities of 1994, many
milestones in the direction of the attainment of a durable
peace have been established.

However. we have had to face occasional obstacles
which stand in the way of the realization of our best hopes.
The peace effort is a confidence-building process. Parties to
this process should refrain from any action or measure
which could lead to mistrust and to a gradual erosion of a
carefully and laboriously designed peace process,
jeopardizing the intense efforts which have been made. In
this context, it is with concern and apprehension that we
witness the latest developments related to the decision to
initiate new settlement activities in East Jerusalem.

The Brazilian Government wishes the parties involved
in the peace process to immediately resume the positive
track of dialogue and compromise, on the basis of
agreements already reached and observing legal obligations
and responsibilities under universally accepted international
instruments, Only through the renewal of mutual trust
among the parties will it be possible to surmount this
difficulty while continuing to strive for durable peace in the
region."
