The President: There are no more names inscribed
on the list of speakers. I would like to thank everyone
who participated today, both from the delegations of
small island developing States and those of the many
other Member States who spoke.

Before adjourning the meeting, since this is the last
scheduled meeting of the Council for the month
of July 2015, I would like to express the sincere
appreciation of the delegation of New Zealand to
the members of the Security Council, especially
the Permanent Representatives and their staffs, and
to the secretariat of the Council for all the support
they have given us.

It has been a very busy month, and one in which
we addressed many pressing issues. On some very
important questions we were able to achieve consensus,
and we could not have done that alone and without the
hard work, support and positive contributions of every
delegation and the representatives of the Secretariat,
as well as all the relevant conference service officers.
As we end our presidency, I know I speak on behalf of
my colleagues on the Council in offering the delegation
of Nigeria our very best wishes and good luck for the
month of August.

The meeting rose at 6.50 pm.
