Mr. Al-Mouallimi (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): When I hear the Syrian representative speak, I
feel like laughing. He described us as the sons of Saud;
we are very proud to be sons of Saud, from the Saud
dynasty. He accused us of promoting Islam, which we
certainly do, but we do not use chemical weapons to
kill our own children and citizens, as does the Syrian
regime. We do not terrorize our own people, as does the
Syrian rcgimc.

Whenever I hear such accusations from the Syrian
representative, I feel like telling them that he is really
talking about himself, not us, What they are doing
is trying to meddle in Gulf country affairs and the

crises in that area. They want to take advantage ofthat
situation, but they should not interfere in these things.
If it were us, we would be ashamed. We would at least
try to avoid disgraeing our own Government and killing
our children.

The meeting rose at 6.10 pm.
