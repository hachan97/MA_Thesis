Mr. Llorentty Soliz (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (Spoke in Spanish): The delegation of Bolivia
would like to thank the representatives of the Office for
the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World
Food Programme and the World Health Organization
for their briefings today on the tragic situation facing
the Syrian people.

Bolivia would also like to emphasize the fact that
the ceasefire instituted by Russia, Turkey and Iran has
been effective and has had a direct impact not just on
the possibility of improving the humanitarian situation
but also, as the Secretary-General's report (S/2017/58)
states, on reducing the level of violence in the country.
It represents a step in the right direction for reaching
a political outcome that can end the violence, prevent
further bloodshed among civilians and provide them
with immediate humanitarian access. We welcome
the efforts of all the humanitarian organizations on
the ground, including the work of the Red Crescent,
in conditions that have been described as extremely
difficult. In that regard, we urge all parties to abide
strictly by international humanitarian law in order
to ensure the success of the ceasefire, the protection
of civilians and civilian structures, the lifting of
the sieges and, of course, a political solution to the
conflict. We also welcome the fact that, according to
the communique issued after the meeting in Astana, the
parties are seeking a political outcome and a ceasefire
that will contribute to "reducing violence, building
confidence [and] ensuring unhindered humanitarian
access swiftly and smoothly". That is of course a step in
the right direction for an intra-Syrian political process
conducted under the auspices of the United Nations,
aimed at ending this tragic conflict once and for all.
