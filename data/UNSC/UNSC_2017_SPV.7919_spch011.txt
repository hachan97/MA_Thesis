Mr. Bessho (Japan): I join others in expressing
my sincere condolences to the families of the victims
of today's attack in Stockholm. We stand in solidarity
with the people of Sweden.

Turning to Syria, the use of chemical weapons
is not permissible under any circumstances. Three
days ago, we faced another shocking report that many
innocent civilians had become victims of chemical
weapons in Syria. The act is extremely inhumane and
violates the relevant Security Council resolutions.
The Government of Japan supports the determination
of the United States Government to never allow the
spread or use of chemical weapons. We understand that
the United States took the action last night in order to
prevent further aggravation of the situation.

The Council must reaffirm its determination to

address the reported use of chemical weapons in Idlib.
Once again, Japan urges the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) Fact-finding
Mission to expeditiously conduct an investigation and
report its conclusion as soon as possible, so that the
OPCW-United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism
can conduct its own investigation in order to identify
those who are responsible.

In conclusion, Japan reiterates its position that
there is no military solution for Syria. We must advance
the political process based on resolution 2254 (2015).
