Mr. Matjila (South Africa): We thank the
United Kingdom, in its capacity as the penholder,
for its transparency, tireless efforts and commitment
to facilitating resolution 2472 (2019), which we
just adopted.

The renewal of the mandate of the African Union
Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) is a significant
undertaking by the Security Council in support of the
Federal Government and the people of Somalia. We
recognize the fundamental role of AMISOM. in efforts
to restore security and stability in Somalia. It would
have otherwise been impossible to achieve. AMISOM's
role is also invaluable as Somalia prepares for 2020-
2021 elections.

South Africa aligns itself with the African Union
(AU) Commission and the AU Peace and Security
Council's principled call on the AU, the United Nations
and key partners in Somalia to provide the required
resources to support AMISOM. in a sustained and
predictable manner. That is important, as AMISOM's
tasks and responsibilities require it to align its logistical
and equipment capabilities and capacities with the
realities and changes on the ground.

Stability and enhanced security in Somalia will
improve the security of the shipping lanes in the Horn
of Africa, thereby ensuring free trade flows around the
world to benefit all of us. We should therefore appreciate
the contribution of AU troop-contributing countries
in that regard. Hence the necessity for the Security
Council to agree on funding such a vital peacekeeping
operation, which benefits us all, around the world.

We remain concerned about the prevailing
precarious humanitarian situation in Somalia. We call
on the international community to redouble its efforts
to improve the humanitarian situation and to protect all
those who are vulnerable.
