Mr. Oh Joon (Republic of Korea): I would like
to thank Ambassador Gary Quinlan for his briefing
on the work of the Committee established pursuant
to resolution 1737 (2006). We appreciate his able
leadership and the robust work of the Panel of Experts
over the reporting period.

With the talks between the P5+1 and Iran set to
resume shortly, I reiterate the Republic of Korea's firm
support for the ongoing diplomatic process to resolve
the Iranian nuclear issue. We hope that an agreement
will be reached within the extended time frame on a
joint comprehensive plan of action that fully addresses
all existing concerns. We urge Iran to cooperate fully
with the International Atomic Energy Agency to clarify
all present and past unresolved issues. We also believe
that, notwithstanding the diplomatic process, the
measures provided for by Security Council resolutions
on Iran remain fully in effect.

In that regard, the interdiction in the Red Sea
of conventional arms last March, which the 1737
Committee Chair mentioned in his briefing today, is
a reminder that we should remain vigilant against
Iran's prohibited activities. The Committee needs to
actively follow up on the Panel report on that case and
take the necessary measures in response. On the same
note, it is important that the 1737 (2006) Committee
continue to discuss ways to effectively implement the
recommendations of the Panel of Experts' final report
(S/2014/394, annex), such as on information-sharing for
cases of proliferation financing and alerting companies
of the risks of trading dual-use goods.

Finally, we are pleased to learn that the Secretariat
has completed the reappointment of the Panel following
the extension of its mandate until next year. We look
forward to continuing to work closely with the Panel.
