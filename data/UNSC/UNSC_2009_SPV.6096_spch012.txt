Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Today's meeting of the Security Council is
very symptomatic. It was convened in haste and
without due preparation, and underscores the absence
of a coordinated strategy on Darfur on the part of the
international community and the Security Council that
would assiduously address the political solution,
peacekeeping and the search for justice. If what we are
witnessing here is the expression of a certain policy, it
is a dangerous one that will, unfortunately, lead first
and foremost to the suffering of the people of Darfur
and other regions of the Sudan.

We warmly welcome the efforts of the
humanitarian organizations and the United Nations in
Darfur to provide humanitarian assistance to civilians
who have suffered as a result of the conflict. As a result
of those efforts, we have been able to save thousands
of lives in Darfur. We believe that we should continue
dialogue with the Government of the Sudan regarding
activities of international non-governmental agencies
on that country's territory.

We await an additional detailed assessment of the
situation in the country following the Visit of the
Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs,
Mr. Holmes. All necessary humanitarian assistance
must be provided to the population of Darfur. The
complex humanitarian situation in Darfur is caused by
the armed confrontation between the Darfur opposition
and the Government of the Sudan, banditry and the
violence resulting from the actions of armed groups.

It is necessary to ensure that the parties to the
conflict pursue all efforts to stabilize the situation.
Normalizing the humanitarian situation will be
impossible without a conclusive political solution
backed by the peacekeeping efforts of the African
Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur.
That is an integrated way to resolve the Darfur crisis,
and the international community must work together to
promote it.
