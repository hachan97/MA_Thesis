Mr. Al-Malki (Palestine) (spoke in Arabic): The
adoption of resolution 1860 (2009) was delayed several
days despite the humanitarian crisis and the appalling
loss of lives among civilians in Gaza. More than 760
Palestinian martyrs have fallen, 40 per cent of them
women and children. More than 3,000 persons have
been wounded, and vast damage has been done to the
basic infrastructure in the district, including United
Nations installations, in flagrant breach of international
humanitarian law.

After days-long consultations to reach this
binding resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire,
Israel must now put an end to its aggression against the
Palestinian people and fully withdraw Israeli forces
from the Gaza Strip. The resolution calls for the lifting
of the blockade and the opening of the crossings in
accordance with the 2005 Agreement on Movement
and Access, and calls for guarantees ensuring the
sustained opening of those crossings.

In that regard, we would like to express our
thanks to all our Arab brethren in the Arab Ministerial
Council, chaired by His Royal Highness Prince Saud
Al-Faisal, for their principled and united position. This
played a fundamental role in achieving, together with
friendly countries, the adoption of the resolution.

Now Israel, the occupying Power, must
immediately implement this resolution. Aggression
must cease so that we all may have the opportunity to
work to heal our people's wounds and to rebuild what
the brutal Israeli war machine has destroyed in Gaza.
