Mr. Rycroft (United Kingdom): Russia's
procedural proposal is a cynical attempt to link two
things that do not need to be linked and that should
not be linked - the mandate of the Joint Investigative
Mechanism, on the one hand, and its report, which is
due imminently, on the other. Attempting to link the
two, as Russia is doing, is politicization. Going ahead
with the meeting and with the vote as planned is the way
that the supporters of the draft resolution (8/2017/884)
have attempted to avoid politicization. I think that we
should go to great lengths to make sure that there is
no politicization in the mandate renewal of the Joint
Investigative Mechanism, and the best way to avoid
politicizing such an important issue is to go ahead with
the vote on the mandate renewal today, as planned.
Secondly, on a point of practicality, we saw what
happened a year ago when there was uncertainty about
the future of the Joint Investigative Mechanism. Its
staff left, its capability dwindled and it was unable to
operate for some months. The only beneficiaries of a
significant similar delay this time around would be
the users of chemical weapons in Syria - Da'esh, the
Syrian regime and their backers.
