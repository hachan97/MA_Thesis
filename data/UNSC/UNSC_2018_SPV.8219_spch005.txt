Mr. Miller (United States of America): We note
that the representative of Israel is unable to attend
today's meeting, owing to the fact that it is taking
place during the celebration of Passover. It is extremely
unfortunate that Israel is not able to participate in the

discussion of this very important matter. It is also
vital that the Council take a balanced approach to all
matters that come before it, and we should have found
an arrangement enabling all the parties to participate
this evening.

Turning to the issue of Gaza, we are deeply
saddened by the loss of life there today. We urge those
involved to take steps to lower tensions and reduce the
risk of new clashes. Bad actors who use protests as a
cover for inciting violence endanger innocent lives. The
international community, including the United States,
is focused on taking concrete near-term steps that will
improve the humanitarian and economic conditions
in Gaza and the lives of the Palestinians living there.
We are also hard at work on a plan for peace that will
provide a future for both Israel and the Palestinians.
Violence furthers neither of those goals.
