Mr. Mayr-Harting (Austria): Austria has
condemned the nuclear test of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea of 25 May 2009 in the strongest
terms as a direct violation of resolution 1718 (2006).
The unanimous adoption of the present resolution is a
clear, fully appropriate and unequivocal response by
the Council and the international community to the
nuclear test of the Democratic People's Republic and
the threat it poses to international peace and security.

As co-chairs of the Article XIV process of the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT),
Costa Rica and Austria in particular welcome the call
on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to join
the CTBT at the earliest date, a call contained in
operational paragraph 29 of the resolution. Costa Rica
and Austria believe that the recent events highlight the
necessity and urgency of a rapid entry into force of the
Treaty. Both countries also wish to underline the very
valuable contribution made by the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization in providing
reliable data on the Democratic People's Republic
nuclear test of 25 May 2009.
