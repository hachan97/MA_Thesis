Mr. Assaf (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): Lebanon
very much appreciates the efforts and the sacrifices
that have been made by the United Nations Interim
Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) to secure peace and
security in the region. The Lebanese Government
would like to underscore the importance that it attaches
to UNIFIL and to the fact that UNIFIL must remain in
place, carrying out its tasks in keeping with resolution
425 (1978), without any review or change whatsoever.

The Government of Lebanon believes that it
would have been desirable to draft a technical
resolution to extend UNIFIL's mandate without
selectively highlighting passages from the Secretary-
General's report and without introducing any political
elements into the resolution. Those elements could
have a detrimental effect on peace and security.
