The President: Mr. Guehenno has been unable to
remain in the Council Chamber, so in the absence of
objection, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Hedi Annabi,
Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping
Operations.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
I call on Mr. Annabi.
