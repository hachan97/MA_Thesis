Mr. Hmoud (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): Jordan
welcomes the adoption of resolution 2199 (2015),
which will help to cut off the sources of funding for
the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and
affiliated terrorist groups. We must fight ISIL with all
tools available under international law. Resolution 2199
(2015) is one such tool. The international community
must pool its efforts to fight the funding of terrorism
in all its forms and manifestations. Jordan will be on
the front line in fighting this phenomenon and these
terrorist groups, including ISIL. The martyrdom of the
pilot Muath Al-Kaseasbeh makes Jordan even more
resolved to persevere in these efforts.
