Mr. Takasu (Japan): Japan joined in the adoption
of resolution 1907 (2009) because it respects the
initiative by African countries to contribute to stability
in the Horn of Africa, including the situations in
Somalia, Djibouti and Eritrea. It is Japan's conviction
that disputes should be resolved and conflicts settled
by diplomatic means, including dialogue and
mediation. Efforts towards the resolution of conflict in
the Horn of Africa should be accelerated.

Japan sincerely hopes that all States in the region,
including Eritrea, will comply with the relevant
Security Council resolutions and engage in dialogue
with the international community, including through
the good offices efforts of the Secretary-General.

The Security Council will keep the measures
under constant review in the light of future
developments, in order to contribute to peace and
stability in the region.
