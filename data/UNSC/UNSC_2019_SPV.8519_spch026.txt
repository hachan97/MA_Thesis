Mr. Ahmed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): Council
members are aware that with respect to resolution 1990
(2011), which was preceded by the June 2011 agreement
on the arrangements for Abyei, we were able, through
the Council, to agree on an important institution
for the Abyei area, namely, the joint police service
for Abyei. We are of course aware that the Council
adopted resolution 2438 (2018), under which the police
component of the United Nations Interim Security
Force for Abyei (UNISFA) was to be augmented. That
requires various measures and consultations in order
to avoid undermining the agreements that have been
signed between the Sudan and South Sudan.

The Council and before it the African Union have
said that the formation of essential mechanisms and
institutions for Abyei is the only way forward towards
defining the final status of Abyei. The relevant authorities
of the Sudan are taking the necessary measures in order
to create conditions favourable to the consideration of
the issuance of visas to the proposed police personnel,
in conformity with the Council's resolution. However,
we need more time for that. We hope that the Council
will understand the situation and give us more time,
so that we can take the measures necessary to prevent
any negative impact on the situation on the ground. It
must also be taken into account that the situation is now
changing in the Sudan and that these changes have had,
of course, an impact on all State institutions that are
seeking to create the proper conditions for UNISFA'S
work in Abyei.

To conclude, the consideration of the issuance of
visas for the police components in Abyei is ongoing
within the relevant institutions in the Sudan.
