Sir Emyr Jones Parry (United Kingdom): Like
other colleagues, I am grateful to both speakers for
their contributions earlier.

Ending impunity for past crimes in Burundi is
vital. It is necessary for national reconciliation. It is
essential for justice, and it is a desirable deterrent
throughout the region. Therefore, the United Kingdom
supports very much the recommendations we have
heard this afternoon.

The hybrid special chamber, with the mandate up
to the present day, should deliver the lasting benefits
which are necessary, will help the Burundian judicial
system and will be, we hope, a continuing deterrent to
any future actions.

Mr. Zacklin's justification of the commission,
which we set in the context of the work of the special
chamber, was particularly welcome, because we had
been interested in the interaction, how the two would
come together.

I think the questions I would have asked have
been asked. I would just extend from the United
Kingdom every best wish to Burundi now as it moves
forward, that it should do so with utmost success.
