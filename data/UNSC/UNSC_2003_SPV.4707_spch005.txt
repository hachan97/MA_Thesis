The President: I thank Mr. ElBaradei for his
briefing.
Before giving the floor to Council members, I
wish to recall the understanding reached among
ourselves, namely, that all participants will limit their
statements to no more than seven minutes, in order to
enable the Council to work efficiently within its
timetable.

I now call on Mr. Farouk Al-Shara', Deputy
Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the
Syrian Arab Republic.
