The President: I thank the representative of
Nepal for the kind words he addressed to me.
I would urge members once again to try to limit
their statements to five minutes, considering the
number of speakers remaining on the list.

The next speaker on my list is the representative
of Qatar. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table
and to make his statement.
