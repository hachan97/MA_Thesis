Mr. Bermudez (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish):
At the outset, my delegation would like to thank the
Russian Federation and Turkey for this proposal.
Although the text is imperfect could have been further
improved, we voted in its favour. Today, similar to what
occured on 19 December when the Security Council
adopted resolution 2328 (2016), members had additional
consultations to occur and for adjustments to be made to
the original text. To our satisfaction, that strengthened
the text and made possible its unanimous adoption.

As indicated in today's resolution 2336 (2016), it will
be necessary to implement the provisions of resolutions
2254 (2015) and 2268 (2016), and to harmonize the
forthcoming Astana talks with the United-Nations-
backed negotiations. We sincerely hope that 2017 will

be a better year for the Syrian Arab Republic and
Syrians than the year ending today. With everyone
participating, we can achieve a lasting cessation of
hostilities and the resumption of successful political
negotiations. We owe that to the tens of thousands of
Syrian civilians who lost their lives in this terrible war.

In conclusion, I would like to pay tribute to the
Spanish presidency for its leadership and the consistent
coordinating role it played in achieving consensus
among Council members during the month of December.
