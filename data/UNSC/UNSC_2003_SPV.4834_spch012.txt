Mr. Munoz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): At the
outset, we would like to thank Mr. Kalomoh for his
thorough briefing on the current situation in Guinea-
Bissau. We would also like to thank the Minister for
Foreign Affairs of Timor-Leste, Mr. Jose Ramos Horta,
Special Envoy of the Community of Portuguese-
Speaking Countries, for his excellent statement.

Chile condemns the resolution of the situation in
Guinea-Bissau by force and would like to point out that
all coups d'e'tat should be repudiated, whether
bloodless or violent. We recognize, however, the
fundamental role played by the Economic Community
of West Africa States (ECOWAS). It is a positive sign
and shows Africa's desire to take responsibility for
resolving its own problems.

Thanks to the intervention and approach of
ECOWAS, there has been a positive turn of events after
the coup. We welcome the agreements that have been
reached, the signing of the Transitional Constitution
and the commitments concerning the holding of
elections as well as the appointment of an interim
President and Prime Minister.

However, as several delegates around the table
have said, we believe that it is important for the
Security Council to continue to very closely monitor
the situation, together with ECOWAS, to help to
prevent the future interim Government from making
the same mistakes as the previous Government - in
particular, failing to establish conditions for elections
by secret ballot that are genuinely democratic, free and
timely.
