Mr. Moungara Moussotsi (Gabon) (spoke in French): My delegation voted in favour of the draft
resolution submitted by the non-aligned countries to
encourage the two parties to resume direct talks with a
view to a lasting peace in the Middle East. We thus
invite the State of Israel and Palestine to overcome all
differences and to come to an agreement with a view to
resuming direct negotiations and to work towards a just
and lasting peace, with the ultimate goal of creating a
Palestinian State living side by side with Israel within
secure and internationally recognized borders.
