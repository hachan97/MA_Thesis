Mr. Albanai (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At the
outset, I would like to thank Ms. Rosemary DiCarlo,
Ms. Ursula Mueller and Ambassadors Apakan and
Sajdik for their valuable briefings on the situation in
eastern Ukraine.

We have been following the continued instability
in eastern Ukraine, now in its fifth year, with concern.
The situation there has had significant humanitarian
and economic consequences that affect residents'
daily lives and have damaged its infrastructure. As
Ms. Mueller said, more than 3.5 million of 5.2 million
people are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance,
along with more than 1.5 million who are internally
displaced. We therefore urge both parties to refrain
from any provocative action that could exacerbate the
ongoing conflict or prevent progress being made in
implementing the Minsk agreements, which represent
the only agreed framework for a regional settlement
of the conflict. Demonstrating the necessary political
will to recommit fully to the Minsk agreements is still
the only way that regional security and stability can
be maintained.

We renew our commitment to Ukraine's
unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity within
its internationally recognized borders, and to
non-interference in its internal affairs. We hope that
all the relevant parties will fully implement resolution
2202 (2015), the Minsk agreements and presidential
statement S/PRST/2018/12, of 6 June 2018. We also
hope that they will seek a comprehensive and balanced
solution to the issue through dialogue, in line with
article 33 of the Charter of the United Nations and in
accordance with the Normandy format and the Trilateral
Contact Group, with a View to making immediate
progress in every area. In that regard, we commend
the Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe and its efforts on
the ground, especially in facilitating dialogue among
all the parties to the conflict.
