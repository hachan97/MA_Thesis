Mrs. Ashipala-Musavyi (Namibia): We too would
like to thank the Secretary-General for his report on the
situation in Tajikistan. We also thank Mr. Annabi for the
introductory remarks he has made.

Tajikistan has had its first-ever multi-party elections.
We believe that this in itself is a very significant and
major achievement. We do take serious note of the
content of paragraph 10 of the Secretary-General's report.
However, in my delegation's View, the weaknesses in the
elections legislation can only be improved and perfected
over time, and it is our hope that the Tajik Government
will move in this direction.

Democratization is a process; it does not take root
with one election, nor with two. It also depends on many
other aspects. We are encouraged, however, that despite
the obstacles, the Tajik parties have embarked on the path
to reconciliation and democracy. We believe that what is
very important and crucial at this time is for all of us to
nurture this fledgling democracy by providing assistance
to the Tajik Government.

In this context, and with regard to the possible role
to be played by the United Nations during the post-
conflict peace-building and consolidation period, my
delegation appreciates the ongoing consultations with the
Government of Tajikistan. We look forward to further
information from the Secretary-General in this regard.

We further agree with the Secretary-General that the
fact that the transition period envisaged in the General
Agreement is coming to a close is a significant
achievement. We share his assessment regarding the
commendable role that the United Nations has played in
the third process. Our particular praise also goes to the
United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan
(UNMOT) for its instrumental role in ensuring the
implementation of the provisions of the Agreement.

Finally, my delegation agrees with the elements of
the statement proposed by the Russian delegation.
