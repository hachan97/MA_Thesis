The President (spoke in Spanish): I would like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Kenya, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda.

In accordance with the usual practice, I propose,
with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the discussion without
the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

If there is no objection, it is so decided.

I invite the representative of Kenya to take the
seat reserved for him at the side of the Council
chamber.

I wish to remind all speakers of what I indicated
at the morning session, in other words, that they limit
their statements to no more than five minutes in order
to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing and to
deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber. In addition, I will not be individually
inviting speakers to take seats at the table, and inviting
them to resume their seats on the side. When a speaker
is taking the floor, the conference officer will seat the
next speaker on the list at the table. I thank you for
your understanding and cooperation.

The next speaker inscribed on my list under rule
37 is the representative of Israel. I now give him the
floor.
