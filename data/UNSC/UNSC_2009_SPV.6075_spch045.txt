The President (spoke in French): All that
remains is for me once again to thank Mr. Le Roy,
Ms. Malcorra and Mr. Annabi for their most useful
participation and that of all of those who have spoken
during this debate.

There are no further speakers on my list. I think
that this has been a useful and enriching debate, which
has provided many new elements to fuel the upcoming
exercise. On the basis of these exchanges and the ideas
we have heard, France, together with the United
Kingdom, now intends to distribute, as an official
document of the Security Council, a revised version of
our non-paper. On that basis, we can launch our work
over the next few months. I would reiterate that we
attach great importance to having everyone work along
these lines. We are counting on the upcoming
presidencies of the Security Council to continue this
work and organize events and discussions on it - in
short, to strengthen this exercise and refresh it.

In conclusion, a first stage could be completed by
mid-year, perhaps during the United Kingdom
presidency in August, and a presidential statement
could then be adopted in order to formally announce
the results of this exercise. That is what France and the
United Kingdom intend to do.

The meeting rose at 3 pm.
