Mr. Schulz (Germany): We welcome the
unanimous adoption of resolution 2491 (2019),
renewing this mandate for a period of 12 months.
Considering the situation on the ground, it is crucial
to uphold the mandate authorizing Member States
and regional organizations to inspect vessels involved
in people-smuggling off the coast of Libya. It is also
crucial for the international community to speak
with one voice. The fighting must stop, and all States
must strictly enforce the arms embargo. These are the
preconditions for the long-overdue return to a credible
and inclusive political process in Libya.

The European Union military operation in the
Southern Central Mediterranean (EUNAVFOR MED operation SOPHIA) is in this regard a key contribution
of the European Union to Libya's stability. The operation
contributes to the achievement of two objectives:
first, to enforce the arms embargo, and, secondly, to
combat human trafficking. Just recently the mandate
of EUNAVFOR MED operation SOPHIA was extended
until the end of March 2020. In that respect, we wish
to reiterate that the suspension of the operation's naval
assets is temporary and that even in the absence of
those assets, the mission is operational and making an
important contribution to assisting Libya.

The Council's decision today allows it to operate
and to perform in the best possible way; this decision is
also a strong sign of support for the efforts of Special
Representative of the Secretary-General Salame to
bring a negotiated peace to Libya.
