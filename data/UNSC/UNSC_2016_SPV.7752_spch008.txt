Mr. Gonzalez de Linares Palou (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): As we said at yesterday's open debate at
the ministerial level (see S/PV.7750), in our opinion
we have failed to help the Burundians build a lasting
peace and have been unable to show a united front in
conveying to the Government of Burundi the urgent
need to find a way out of this crisis. We did not achieve
consensus, but the Council was nevertheless able to
adopt a decision - resolution 2303 (2016) - which in
and of itself is already tremendously important.

What do we see in this resolution? We see three
things. First, we are sending a message to the country
that the rounds of dialogue should continue, in order
to ensure the protection of civilians and the general
population so that violations of human rights cease.
Secondly, with resolution 2303 (2016), we are trying to
convey our wish that there be increased coordination
of and coherence in all the various efforts that are
currently being undertaken. Thirdly, and finally, with
the resolution, we are making a clear call to the leaders
of the region to get involved more substantially and
effectively in order to resolve the crisis.

In the 1990s, as we mentioned, we were not able to
avoid catastrophe, but I hope that history has given us a
second chance to try to avoid one now.
