Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We welcome the new Chair of the Security
Council Committee established pursuant to resolution
1737 (2006), Japanese Ambassador Tsuneo Nishida.
We assure him that, in his activities in that post, he can
rely on the support and cooperation of the Russian
delegation.

We thank the Chair for the briefing on the work
of the 1737 Committee over the past 90 days. During
this reporting period, the Committee continued to
operate in strict compliance with its mandate. We
anticipate that the recently adopted work programme of
the Committee will be help that entity to effectively
carry out the challenges facing it. We anticipate also
that the Panel of Experts referred to in resolution 1929
(2010) will be of considerable assistance to the
Committee once it is constituted.

On the current situation with respect to the
Iranian nuclear programme, our position remains
unchanged.

We have consistently advocated addressing the
issues relating to this programme through dialogue and
interaction with the Iranian side. The pillar of the
Russian position has always been and continues to be
reliance on negotiations and a diplomatic search for
solutions as well as involving Tehran in joint
endeavours, while ensuring full compliance with the
actions of the IAEA. We call for Iran's cooperation in
taking the steps necessary to ensure a broad dialogue
with the six countries, aimed at a negotiated settlement
on the issues relating to the Iranian nuclear
programme.
