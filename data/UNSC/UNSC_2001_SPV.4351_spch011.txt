Mr. Granovsky (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): 1, too, would like to express gratitude to the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General,
Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, for his important and
interesting briefing. We have also listened attentively
to the very substantive statement by the member of the
Transitional Cabinet and major political figure of East
Timor, Jose Ramos-Horta.

Today's meeting of the Security Council is
dedicated to reviewing the important processes taking
place in East Timor, in particular within the framework
of preparations for the Constituent Assembly.
Necessary assistance for this review is provided by the
progress report of the Secretary-General on the
activities of the United Nations Transitional
Administration in East Timor. The report is an
extremely substantive document that provides a
detailed description of the efforts of the United Nations
Transitional Administration in East Timor and of
successes in the Timorization of the structures of power
as the movement towards independence advances. We
share the conclusions of the Secretary-General and the
thrust of his ideas concerning the future role of the
United Nations in East Timor. We expect that they will
take on the form of recommendations in his next
report, to be submitted at the end of October.

We consider that preparations for the transition of
East Timor to a new status is being carried out in a
logically planned manner. It is extremely important that
this process remain smooth.

In any case, the Security Council must take into
account the need for a thorough adjustment of its
actions so that the future - in our View, absolutely
indispensable - evolution of the United Nations
presence in East Timor does not impinge on this
process. It is necessary to recall here that the operation
in East Timor opened up a fundamentally new page in
United Nations peacekeeping and that its success or
failure is directly linked to the prestige of the United
Nations.
