Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
thanks Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo and Assistant
Secretary-General Mueller for their briefings.

China respects the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of all States, including Ukraine, and opposes
interference in Ukraine's internal affairs by any external
forces. China has closely followed developments in
the situation in eastern Ukraine. China hopes that
all parties concerned will take concrete measures to
prevent the escalation of conflict and confrontation and
work together to ease tensions.

The situation in Ukraine has complex historical
and contemporary factors and its handling requires
comprehensive and balanced considerations.

First, the general direction of a political settlement
must be upheld. On the one hand, the legitimate rights,
interest and aspirations of all regions and ethnic groups
in Ukraine should be fully accommodated; on the other,
attention must also be paid to addressing the reasonable
concerns of all relevant parties to achieve a balance
among all interests.

Secondly, we continue to call for the comprehensive
implementation of resolution 2202 (2015) and the Minsk
II agreements, as well as the ceasefire and the cessation
ofhostilities in eastern Ukraine so that a comprehensive,
lasting and balanced solution to the Ukrainian issue can
be found through dialogue and consultation.

Thirdly, the international community must continue
to promote diplomatic efforts to find a political solution
to the issue. The members of the Security Council
should remain united. Discussions in the Council should
contribute to achieving a genuine de-escalation in the
relevant regions of Ukraine and play a constructive role
in achieving a political settlement. China has always
maintained an objective and impartial position on the
Ukrainian crisis and remains committed to playing a
positive role in the political statement of the crisis.
