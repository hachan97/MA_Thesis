Mr. Ripert (France) (spoke in French): France
fully supports the activities of the United Nations
Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS) and more generally
speaking those of the Secretary-General and of the
United Nations system in that country. France is firmly
committed to the implementation of the
Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which UNMIS is
mandated to assist. The Agreement has helped put an
end to several decades of conflict and has defined a
framework for peace, unity and the future development
of the Sudan.

We are also firmly committed to the peaceful
resolution of the Darfur crisis, which has for several
years made necessary the largest humanitarian
operation in the world. In that context, we back the
Secretary-General's three tracks for action to address
the crisis situation created by the decision of the
Government of the Sudan to expel numerous
09-31939
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), as clearly
described in the report of the Secretary-General
(S/2009/le).

In particular, we continue to call upon the
Government of the Sudan to reverse the closures and
expulsions of NGOs which until recently provided a
key portion of the humanitarian assistance to the
population, especially in the Three Areas, and to
restore an environment conducive to the work of
humanitarian actors. We note, as the Secretary-General
notes in his report, that "the expulsions and closures
have the potential to create a serious humanitarian
crisis" (S/2009/211, para. 88).

France is committed to ensuring that the Security
Council and the United Nations system follow the
situation very closely, without underestimating its
gravity, in order to ensure that all parties shoulder their
responsibility under international humanitarian law and
under the commitments they have undertaken, and to
make it possible for humanitarian assistance to reach
people who today desperately need it.
