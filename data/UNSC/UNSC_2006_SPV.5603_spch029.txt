Mr. Fall: Mr. President, with your permission, I
will be very brief, taking into account the lateness of
the hour.

First of all, I would like to thank the speakers
who have taken the floor and who have shown great
interest in the outcome of the Nairobi summit, and to
thank them for their congratulations. I take it that these
felicitations go beyond myself, to each and every
member of the team with whom I have been working
over the last years and, even beyond the team of the
Office of the Special Representative for the Great
Lakes Region, to the representatives of the United
Nations agencies, with whom we have worked very
closely in the Steering Committee in Nairobi during
these years.

I take it also that those congratulations extend to
the African Union, the other part of the joint
secretariat, and beyond that to President Konare, who
was very actively involved in the preparation of the
entire process leading to the Dar es Salaam and Nairobi
Summits and who played a very important role during
the Summits.

I was very encouraged by today's debate,
especially by its focus on the need for the African
Union and the United Nations to continue jointly to
support the new Conference Secretariat and for
ensuring that they continue to be involved in a very
proactive way in conflict prevention, in peacemaking
and in peacebuilding in the whole region of the Great
Lakes.

Last but not least, I hope that the core countries
have received the message that the Council has sent to
them and that they will take the opportunity to show
that they can face the challenges of building up the
Conference Secretariat and operationalizing it in the
three-month period that has been decided upon.
