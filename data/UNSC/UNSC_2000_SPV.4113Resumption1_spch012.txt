Mr. Kasanda (Zambia): My delegation wishes to
congratulate the Panel of Experts on violations of Security
Council sanctions against UNITA for the great amount of
work they put into compiling the report which is before the
Security Council today. Special thanks, of course, go to
Ambassador Fowler for the leadership role he continues to
play to ensure that the sanctions imposed by the Security
Council against UNITA not only remain effective but are
tightened.

My delegation wishes to reiterate the Zambian
Government's commitment to ensuring peace in our region.
As such, we will remain opposed to actions that could
reinforce conflict in neighbouring countries. Peace and
stability must return to Angola without any further suffering
of the Angolan people. To this effect, my Government will
fully cooperate with all efforts by the international
community to ensure compliance with the Security Council
sanctions against UNITA.

With regard to the contents of the report itself, I wish
to state that a number of the suggestions and
recommendations made will certainly prove effective in
ensuring that sanctions are further tightened in order to
completely diminish UNITA's ability to wage war. The
report, however, has just come out, and many Governments,
including my own, have not had a chance to study and
consider it fully. My Government will therefore comment
on the report at an appropriate time.
