Mr. Jagne (Gambia): The appalling humanitarian
situation in Kosovo has been haunting the collective
conscience of the international community for some time
now. It cannot be gainsaid that the present situation is a
result of the wider underlying political problems that have
plagued the area for so long. The key to a lasting
settlement lies in the resolution of these problems. It was
in that spirit that resolution 1160 (1998) was adopted.

It is saddening to note that, contrary to the
expectations placed in the adoption of that resolution, the
situation on the ground did not improve at all. Instead, the
humanitarian and human rights situation deteriorated to an
alarming extent. As was so aptly described by one of our
colleagues, the resolution was thrown back into the face
of the Security Council. This is why the latter was left
with no option but to take a tougher stance.

A resolution with teeth was needed, and therefore
resolution 1199 (1998) was adopted. This is diplomacy
with some backbone, without which the entire situation
would have led to disaster by now. Without being overly
optimistic, we can say that common sense appeared to
have prevailed, leading to the signing in Belgrade of the
agreements to establish verification missions in Kosovo.
This is what the draft resolution before us is all about,
basically. Over and above that, however, it paves the way
for a negotiated settlement, provided that the parties
concerned are ready to cooperate, and we urge them to
strike while the iron is hot.

As it is a balanced text, incorporating as much as
possible the concerns of everybody, my delegation will
vote in favour of the draft resolution.
