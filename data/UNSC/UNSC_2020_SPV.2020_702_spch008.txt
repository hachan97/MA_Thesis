Saint Vincent and the Grenadines remains extremely concerned by the humanitarian situation in Syria. The fate of millions of Syrians depends on the preservation of the cross-border mechanism. We therefore supported resolution 2533 (2020) for the sake of human dignity. Our position has always been, and remains, that we support optimal access arrangements, through all modalities, to guarantee the rapid, uninterrupted and direct provision of aid. Indeed, there are no perfect solutions in these circumstances, and we are guided by the responsibility to ensure that those who rely on the critical lifeline of humanitarian assistance are able to access it. The scaling up of the humanitarian response through cross-line deliveries is needed now more than ever to assist in filling the gaps that now exist. We therefore encourage further cooperation in this regard. We acknowledge the efforts of the co-penholders - Belgium and Germany - in facilitating the discussions on this matter. On complex questions such as this, where there are many competing concerns and different perspectives, the need for an inclusive and consultative approach cannot be overstated. The humanitarian situation in Syria will continue to worsen in the absence of a political solution to the conflict. We must therefore continue to work together to realize the goals of resolution 2254 (2015).
