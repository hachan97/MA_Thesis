Mr. Ndong Mba (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in Spanish): At the outset, I should like to offer my
sincere congratulations to the United Kingdom for
its exemplary presidency during what was for many
a month of vacation. Despite that fact, it managed to
attain very positive outcomes through rich debates
guided by its programme of work.

We also congratulate the United States on assuming
the presidency for the month of September, which is no
easy task. We express out satisfaction with the approach
it has adopted, whereby almost all meetings will be held
in an open modality, allowing the broader members to
be informed as to the content of our discussions. Despite
this being a very busy month due to the preparations
for the holding of the seventy-third session of the
General Assembly, I am convinced that this provisional
programme of work will provide for a month of very
positive outcomes in the Security Council.

With respect to Nicaragua, as we said this morning,

while we regret the prevailing domestic situation in that
Latin American country and call on the Government
of Nicaragua to spare no effort in seeking a solution to
this domestic problem, our Government is of the view
that the situation does not as yet merit discussion in
the Security Council. At present, the Organization of
American States and the United Nations Secretariat
could dedicate efforts, together with the Government of
Nicaragua, to find a solution to the situation. As things
stand, it does not constitute a threat to international
peace and security, and we are therefore of the view
that this matter remains the purview of the joint
preventive diplomacy of the Secretary-General and the
Organization of American States. We will continue to
monitor the situation closely.
