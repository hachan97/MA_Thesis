Mr. Rugunda (Uganda): I want to congratulate
you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the
Council for this month and also to congratulate
Ambassador Heller on the excellent work he did as
President of the Council last month.

On 7 April 2009 my delegation informed the
Council that we would prepare and circulate a draft
presidential statement on the resurgence of
unconstitutional changes of government in Africa, to
be considered under the item "Peace and security in
Africa". Today, I am pleased that, following exhaustive
consultations on the draft presidential statement, which
were characterized by a spirit of give and take over a
period of close to a month, we now have a text that is
acceptable to all delegations. I would like to thank
members for their full cooperation and support.

The African Union considers the prevention of
the scourge of unconstitutional changes of government
to be a key priority. In that regard, the twelfth ordinary
session of the Assembly of the African Union, held on
1 to 3 February 2009, requested international partners,
2
especially the United Nations, to support the efforts of
the African Union.

The presidential statement you are about to read
out is, in our view, a fitting outcome and an expression
of the Security Council's deep concern over the
resurgence of unconstitutional changes of government
in Africa, as well as a show of support for the efforts of
the African Union. Uganda, as Chair of the Ad Hoc
Working Group on Conflict Prevention and Resolution
in Africa, welcomes the Council's support. We believe
that the presidential statement will greatly contribute to
efforts aimed at preventing and deterring the
resurgence of unconstitutional changes of government
in Africa, now and in the future.
