The President: I apologize if there was any
misunderstanding. I am reminded that what I said
yesterday in summing up was that we would hear from
Ambassador Levitte, as chairman of the mission, then
from representatives of the countries that the mission
visited, if they wished to speak, and that we would then
hear from Council members who wished to speak. I
apologize if that implied that there was an agreement
on how indication would be registered that members
wished to speak, but I do have here a list of members
who have indicated a wish to speak and I will stick
with that list.
