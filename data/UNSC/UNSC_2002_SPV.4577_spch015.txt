The President: I was struck, Mr. Guehenno, by
your comments on the need for wider security sector
reform. I hope that will come up in the discussions we
have following our next contribution, which will be
from the Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator,
Ms. Carolyn McAskie. I ask Ms. McAskie to take the
floor.
