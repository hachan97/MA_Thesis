Indonesia welcomes the unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 2560 (2020), relating to the Security Council committee established pursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999), 1989 (2011) and 2253 (2015), concerning the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Da'esh) and Al-Qaida and associated individuals, groups, undertakings and entities. As a co-penholder, we thank all members of the Security Council for their support and constructive engagement during the negotiation process. Our appreciation, of course, goes to our co-penholder on the issue, the United States of America, for its excellent collaboration in bringing this important resolution to the finish line. This resolution is also in line with Indonesia's commitment to utilize sanctions as an important tool in support of comprehensive counter-terrorism efforts, which has been one of the priorities of our membership in the Security Council. Resolution 2560 (2020) not only tasks the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team to provide the Committee with specific recommendation but also continues to encourage all Member States to actively submit listing requests; submit information in order to keep the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Da'esh) and Al-Qaida sanctions list reliable and up-to-date; and make use of exemptions to the sanctions measures in accordance with relevant Security Council resolutions. The resolution may be succinct, but it represents a milestone. This resolution is an important part of our continuous endeavour to increase fairness and the effectiveness of the rules and procedures of our sanctions committees. Therefore, our common achievement today is a symbol of a small but important step to that end.
