The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Zimbabwe, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Chidyaasiku
(Zimbabwe) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Lynn Pascoe,
Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs.

It is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in response to a letter dated 18 June
2008 from the Permanent Representative of Belgium
addressed to the President of the Security Council and
contained in document 8/2008/407.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Lynn Pascoe, Under-Secretary-General
for Political Affairs. I now give the floor to Mr. Pascoe.
