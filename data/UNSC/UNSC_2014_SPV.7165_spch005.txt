Mr. Araud (France) (spoke in French): I thank
Mr. Feltman for his briefing.

Since early April, the situation in Ukraine
has deteriorated continuously. In several eastern
cities, armed militants, acting in a professional and
synchronized manner, have taken possession of public
buildings. The similarity of the operations that were
observed in Crimea is striking. The violence continues.
Seven observers of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were taken hostage
on 25 April. They must be released without delay. On
Sunday, the mayor of Kharkiv was the target of an
attack and is in a serious condition.

We are witnessing a a subversive operation that
has been planned, barely disguised and orchestrated
by Russia. Russian special forces do not even hide
anymore. Some time ago, our Russian colleague denied
their involvement in Crimea, while his President
recognized it a few days later. No doubt, he will do
the same with respect to current events in Ukraine.
France strongly and unequivocally condemns those
unacceptable attempts by Russia to destabilize
Ukraine. We must halt this course of confrontation
and work towards de-escalation. The joint declaration
agreed on in Geneva on 17 April by Ukraine, Russia,
the United States and the European Union shows the
way forward. It calls on all parties to refrain from
violence and acts of intimidation or provocation. It
provides for the disarmament of illegal armed groups,
evacuation of occupied buildings and public places and
amnesty for those who lay down their arms, with the
exception of individuals with blood on their hands.
It is essential that the declaration be implemented by
all parties without delay and in good faith, so that the
Ukrainian State can re-establish its sovereignty over its
territory. The OSCE's special monitoring mission has
been asked to play an important role in implementing
those de-escalation measures, and it is essential that it
be allowed to act without hindrance.

However, since the declaration's adoption we
have seen two distinct attitudes. On the one hand, the
Ukrainian Government has shown its good faith in
implementing the declaration by drafting an amnesty
law, launching the process of constitutional reform and
accelerating the dismantling of barricades and armed
groups in Kyiv. In that regard, I commend the restraint
and composure of the Ukrainian security forces,
who have responded appropriately to the repeated
destabilizing actions they are dealing with. We can only
imagine what any other Government would have done
in the face of such provocation on its national territory.

On the other hand, the Russian side has complied
with none of the 17 April commitments. There has been
no condemnation of the separatist actions that have
spawned new violence and no call for public buildings
to be evacuated. There has been no appeal to the
pro-Russian militants to exercise restraint and end their
attacks on munitions depots and on their compatriots,
some of whom are said to have been tortured, and on
journalists as well. Far from condemning those who took
the OSCE observers hostage, today Russia is calling the
mission's presence in eastern Ukraine a provocation.
However, we sincerely hope that the announcement
yesterday of a halt to the Russian military manoeuvres
on the Ukrainian border is true and will be the first step
in a genuine de-escalation.

We are at a turning point. With every moment
that passes, the risk of anarchy and bloody incidents
grows. That is why we call on the Russian authorities to
choose the path of de-escalation through the immediate
demonstration of respect for the commitments made in
the Geneva declaration. Yesterday, together with our
European Union partners and the United States, we
adopted new targeted sanctions. If the situation worsens,
we will be forced to ratchet up the sanctions once again.
That is not what we would prefer. Our goal is to ensure
the holding on 25 May of free, inclusive and transparent
presidential elections, whose good conduct will be
guaranteed by the presence of international observers.
The possibility that the actions of some violent groups
could threaten the holding of this democratic exercise
is unacceptable.

We also support constitutional reform that would
ensure respect for minorities and some decentralization.
It is up to all Ukrainians to decide their future. Then
history and geography can bring about an inevitable and
desirable reconciliation between a democratic, peaceful
and independent Ukraine and a Russian Federation that
will renounce its dangerous nationalist illusions.
