The Secretary-General: I have been most gratified
to learn that the obstacles that stood in the way of the
Security Council's being able to authorize deployment of
a group of United Nations military observers to verify
compliance with the agreement on the definitive ceasefire
in Guatemala have been overcome.
 

In recent weeks, the Secretariat has undertaken
intensive consultations on this matter with the parties
concerned and encouraged them to find the common ground
that would allow passage of this resolution to go forward.
I therefore welcome this opportunity to pay tribute to the
constructive approach demonstrated by the Member States
most directly involved and the efforts of the Group of
Friends of the Guatemalan Peace Process in their support.
The adoption by the Security Council of the resolution
before it will allow for the effective verification of one of
the most crucial elements of Guatemala's transition to
peace and reconciliation.

The United Nations has been involved in the
Guatemalan process since it was first asked to provide an
observer to the peace talks in 1990. Since 1994 it has
played a particularly active role, both through moderation
of the peace negotiations and in the deployment of the
United Nations Mission for the Verification of Human
Rights and of Compliance with the Commitments of the
Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights in Guatemala.
The signing of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace
in Guatemala City on 29 December 1996 opens a new
chapter in the United Nations responsibilities. As we
prepare for the overall verification contemplated by the
various accords, I am pleased to acknowledge the support
of the Security Council and Member States at large for
what we all hope will become recognized as one of the
Organization's success stories.
