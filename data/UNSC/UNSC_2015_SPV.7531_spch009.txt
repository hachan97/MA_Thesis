Mr. Barros Melet (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): Chile
voted in favour of resolution 2240 (2015) because it
provides for measures to address an exceptional and
extremely grave situation. Situations as appalling as
that of the refugees and migrants in the Mediterranean
demand that States act in accordance with international
law and the human rights of refugees in order to
guarantee basic protection standards.

Human trafficking and trafficking in migrants
are punishable illegal acts and behaviours that should
be addressed within the framework of the relevant
international and humanitarian laws. This situation
should not give rise to the criminalization of persons
who find themselves in the category of migrants
and/or refugees. Chile firmly believes that the root
causes of such phenomena should be addressed by the
various organs of the United Nations system within
the framework of their respective jurisdictions, which
would contribute to reducing the precarious situation of
persons exploited by traffickers.

The Organization as a whole has a responsibility
to do its part to enable States to act in concert and
solidarity to respond to the humanitarian needs such
phenomena engender and to sanction behaviours that
undermine the dignity and rights of all human beings.

Finally, we would like to reiterate our understanding
that the resolution just adopted grants States or regional
organizations, under exceptional circumstances and for
a limited period of time, the right to intercept vessels
on the high seas, along the coast of Libya, only in
those cases in which there exist reasonable grounds to
suspect trafficking in migrants or human trafficking
and always within the legal framework of the norms
established by the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea.
