Mr. Soares (Portugal): Like others before us, Portugal
would like to commend the African mediation in the
resolution of the crisis in the Central African Republic.
Moreover, we would like to pay tribute to the decision by
the countries of that sub-region to establish an inter-African
monitoring mechanism to help restore peace and security in
the Central African Republic, and in particular to disarm
the former mutineers, the militia and all other unlawfully
armed individuals. I would like to stress the importance we
attach to support for the democratic process, namely to help
prepare the elections to be held in August 1998.

In this context, we fully support and commend the
efforts of the International Monitoring Committee, of its
Chairman, General Toure, and also of President Bongo of
Gabon for their important role in the resolution of the crisis
in the Central African Republic.

The on-going efforts of the Inter-African Mission to
Monitor the Implementation of the Bangui Agreements,
even if not completely successful in terms of the process of
disarmament, have nevertheless made a significant
contribution towards national reconciliation and peace in
that country.

As President Ange-Felix Patasse pointed out in his
letter to the Security Council of 14 July, the situation in his
country continues to be volatile and could affect regional
stability and threaten peace in the region. In fact, the
proliferation of a large supply of weapons in the hands of
former mutineers and of the civilian population is of great
concern. Therefore, the continuous support of the
international community is not only vital for political
stability and peace in that country but also important in
the entire subregion. It was in this context that Portugal
decided to give its support to the draft resolution before
us today, which responds in a positive way to the request
of the President of the Central African Republic, and
gives its support to the efforts of the countries of the
subregion.
