Mr. Mufioz (spoke in Spanish): I would like first
of all to express my thanks for the expressions of
encouragement to me in my work as Chairman of the
Security Council's Al Qaeda and Taliban sanctions
Committee. I would also pay tribute to the tireless
work of the other members of the Committee, the
Monitoring Team and the Secretariat; without their
support, we would be unable to move forward in our
work.

No specific questions have been asked, but I
would like, all the same, to express my thanks for the
suggestions offered by various delegations. They will
be duly taken into account both by our Committee and
by the Monitoring Team. As some delegations have
said in acknowledging our work, much still remains to
be done, and we are committed to tackling those
outstanding challenges. It is not just a question of
receiving reports - and we hope that we will receive
them all, as we must; we also need to continue with our
visits and dialogue in the field. Through direct
communication, this will help to dispel concerns and
deal with problems associated with the implementation
of sanctions as well as enable us, often, to receive
suggestions which will improve our work.

We hope that in the next few months we will be
reporting in writing on our work and the work of the
Monitoring Team and that, ultimately, the cooperation
between Member States and the Committee will
continue to improve, since this is what would really
make our task and our counter-terrorism efforts easier.
That work, we all know, is being actively carried out
and requires more preventive measures and more
concerted action from the Security Council and from
all Members of the United Nations.
