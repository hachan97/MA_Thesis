Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China would like to thank Mr. Morris, Executive
Director of the World Food Programme (WFP), for his
briefing. I would also like to thank him for his positive
assessment of China's poverty reduction strategy.

Over the years, the World Food Programme has
been committed to providing emergency food
assistance to countries and peoples that have
experienced disasters. Not only has it eased
humanitarian crises in recipient countries, it has also
helped to resolve armed conflicts in the countries and
regions concerned. We express our appreciation and
support in that regard.

For quite some time, food crises have troubled
many African countries. We believe that poverty is the
root cause of conflict. In turn, conflict exacerbates
poverty. Eliminating poverty is a requirement for
international peace, development and stability. And
ending conflict is a prerequisite for eliminating
poverty, guaranteeing food security and achieving
sustainable development. Conflicts on the African
continent have ebbed and flowed. That is directly
related to the issue of food crises. The Security
Council, as the body with the primary responsibility for
international peace and security, should adequately
recognize that issue when analysing the causes of
African conflict. That will help us to find basic
solutions to the problem

We hope that today's meeting will lead all sides
to pay adequate attention to the impact of the African
food crisis on peace and security in that region, as well
as to take effective measures to help the African
continent to eliminate hunger and poverty. That is the
only way we can hope to genuinely achieve peace and
stability in Africa.
