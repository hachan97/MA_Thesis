The President: I would like to warmly welcome
Special Envoy Nabarro, Special Representative
Banbury and Mr. Mauget, as well as the representatives
of Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Mali.

Today's meeting continues the very close
engagement of the Security Council on the Ebola
outbreak, which the Council has declared to be a threat
to international peace and security. Ebola was last
discussed in the Council on 14 October (see S/PV.7279).
The briefings today will provide us with a crucial
opportunity to discuss the evolving nature of the crisis,
the challenges faced by Ebola-affected countries on the
ground and the mobilization of the response.

In accordance with rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure, I invite the
representatives of Guinea, Liberia, Mali and Sierra
Leone to participate in this meeting.

The presidency also acknowledges the specific
requests of some countries to participate via video-
teleconferencing and regrets that that was not possible
for technical reasons.

In accordance with rule 39 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure, I invite the following
briefers to participate in this meeting: Mr. Anthony
Banbury, Special Representative of the Secretary-
General and Head of the United Nations Mission on
Ebola Emergency Response; Mr. David Nabarro,
Special Envoy of the Secretary-General on Ebola; and
Mr. Thomas Mauget, Head of the French Red Cross in
Guinea.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

I give the floor to Mr. Nabarro.
