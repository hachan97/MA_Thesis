Mr. Takasu (Japan): I should like to welcome the
presence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey
at this very tragic meeting. We also thank the Deputy
Secretary-General for her presence and the Assistant
Secretary-General Fernandez-Taranco for his briefing.

The Japanese Government is shocked to learn
what took place aboard the maritime convoy carrying
supplies to the Gaza Strip. On a number of occasions,
including through resolution 1860 (2009), the Security
Council has called on Member States to support efforts
to alleviate the humanitarian situation in Gaza. It has
repeatedly called for unimpeded access for
humanitarian aid to Gaza. Japan condemns the violent
acts of hostility that caused this tragic incident
involving the humanitarian convoy, when the
humanitarian situation in Gaza has not improved at all
for a year and a half.

Japan deeply deplores the casualties and the
injuring of so many innocent people. We express our
deepest condolences to the families of victims, and we
believe that full investigation needs to be carried out
urgently. Japan urges parties to act with restraint and to
refrain from taking any further action that might create
a cycle of violence.
