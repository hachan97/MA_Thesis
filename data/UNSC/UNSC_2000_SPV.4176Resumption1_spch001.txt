The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of the Sudan, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Rahmtalla
(Sudan), took the seat reserved for him at the side
ofthe Council chamber

The President: The next speaker inscribed on my
list is the representative of Austria. I invite him to take
a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
