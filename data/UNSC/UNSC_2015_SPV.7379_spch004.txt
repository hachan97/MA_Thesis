Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom):
Resolution 2199 (2015) demonstrates the Security
Council's continuing determination to tackle the
Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), specifically
targetting its means of financing. It primarily focuses on
oil sales, but also covers other sources ofISIL income,
including from kidnapping for ransom, the elicit trade
in antiquities, natural resources and financial transfers.

The swift agreement of the resolution shows the
strong and continuing unity of the Council on countering
terrorism. There is a disturbing body of evidence that
Al-Qaida groups such as ISIL are generating significant

income from the sale of oil, kidnapping for ransom, and
the looting and smuggling of cultural heritage items
from Iraq and Syria. The resolution contains measures
to constrain ISIL's ability to fund its campaign of
terror. It targets the sale of oil by ISIL and the supply
of oil-producing equipment to ISIL. It calls on States to
prohibit the trade in Iraqi and Syrian cultural property
that has been illegally removed.

We are pleased to have played an important role
in ensuring that the resolution was comprehensive in
confronting all sources of terrorist financing, and
we look forward to working on full and effective
implementation following this unanimous show of
support for the resolution.
