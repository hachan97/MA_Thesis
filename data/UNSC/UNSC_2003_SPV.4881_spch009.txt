Mr. Atieh (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): We would like to thank Mr. Danilo Turk,
Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs, for
his comprehensive briefing on the latest developments
in Bougainville.

The Bougainville Peace Agreement aims at
strengthening the foundations of a society enjoying
genuine peace and the restoration of civil authority in
the form of a democratically elected civilian
Government. In that connection, we wish to make the
following points regarding the peace process.

First, the programme to collect and dispose of
arms must continue, especially given the progress made
and the success attained during stage II. Secondly,
former combatants must be reintegrated into civil
society, and plans must be made to ensure security in
that regard and security in general. Thirdly, there is a
need to resolve all pending issues and to integrate all
factions and forces remaining outside the peace
process. Fourthly, the new constitution is of central
importance for the implementation of the Peace
Agreement. We believe the second revised draft text is
extremely important. Fifthly, there is a need for
regional support for the peace process, in particular for
the efforts made by the transition team in Bougainville
in that regard.

Allow me to express our appreciation for the
efforts of the Bougainville Interim Provincial
Government to bring about peace and stability there.
We also appreciate its support for all measures leading
to the establishment of an autonomous government.

In conclusion, my delegation supports the
Secretary-General's recommendation to establish a
United Nations interim observer mission in
Bougainville for a period of six months beginning in
2004. That would help to support the peace process
entered into by the Bougainville Interim Provincial
Government.
