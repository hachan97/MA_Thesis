Mr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We have just unanimously adopted a
resolution as a step that we were obliged to take in
connection with the need to resolve the Iraqi
population's humanitarian problems caused by the
military actions of the United States and the United
Kingdom against Iraq. First and foremost, those
problems should be solved on the basis of the Fourth
Geneva Convention, under whose provisions those who
began this war bear responsibility for meeting the
civilian population's humanitarian needs. Indeed, this
resolution reaffirms that responsibility.

With regard to the United Nations humanitarian
programme for Iraq, the resolution's adjustments to the
programme have a technical and provisional nature and
make it possible to use contracts that have been signed
but not yet implemented in order to solve individual
practical humanitarian issues caused by the war. The
resolution does not change the essence of the
humanitarian programme, and it fully retains the
Security Council's control over the United Nations
special account that is accumulating revenue from the
export of Iraqi oil.

The adoption of the resolution, of course, in no
way signifies any type of legitimization of the military
action being carried out by the coalition in violation of
the Charter of the United Nations. The resolution
clearly calls the participants in the coalition
"occupying Powers" whose actions on the occupied
territory must be guided strictly by all norms of
international humanitarian law, without exception. The
resolution casts no doubt on Iraq's sovereignty and
territorial integrity, and it requires respect for the right
of the Iraqi people to independently decide their own
political future and to exercise control over their
natural resources.
