With the support of the African Union, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, countries of the region and the international community, the political process towards peace in South Sudan has made significant progress recently, and the security situation in the country has also greatly improved. As the primary body for maintaining international peace and security, the Security Council should send positive messages, set aclear timetable for lifting the sanction measures against South Sudan and encourage all parties in South Sudan to pursue their active engagement in the political process in order to maintain the current positive momentum. In May last year, China abstained in the voting on resolution 2471 (2019) as we did not support the arms embargo against South Sudan (see S/PV.8536). This position has not changed. China calls for respect for South Sudan's national sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. The adjustments of sanction measures should fully take into account the positive progress in South Sudan. Therefore, China has abstained in the voting on resolution 2521 (2020). China hopes that the Security Council will make timely and effective adjustments to relevant measures against South Sudan in the light of changes on the ground in the country, help all parties in South Sudan to advance the implementation of the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan and promote governance and security capacity-building in South Sudan.
