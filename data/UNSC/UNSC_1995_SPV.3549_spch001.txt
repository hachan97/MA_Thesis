The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter from the representative of
Liberia in which he requests to be invited to participate in
the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the discussion without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Bull (Liberia)
took a place at the Council table.

The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the eleventh
progress report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Observer Mission in Liberia, document S/ 1995/473.

Members of the Council also have before them
document 8/1995/521, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations.

The first speaker is the representative of Liberia, on
whom I now call.
