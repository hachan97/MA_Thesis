The President: Members have before them
document S/1999/911, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations.

It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/1999/911) before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall
put the draft resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:

Argentina, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, China, France,
Gabon, Gambia, Malaysia, Namibia, Netherlands,
Russian Federation, Slovenia, United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of
America

 

The President: There were 15 votes in favour. The
draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as resolution
1261 (1999).

The representative of the United States has asked for
the floor, and I now call on him.
