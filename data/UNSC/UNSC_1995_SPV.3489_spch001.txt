The President (interpretation from Spanish): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Liberia in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the discussion without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Bull (Liberia),
took a place at the Council table.

The President (interpretation from Spanish): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the eighth
progress report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Observer Mission in Liberia, document S/ 1995/9.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/1995/22, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of the members of
the Council to document S/ 1995/7, which contains the text
of a letter dated 5 January 1995 from the Permanent
Representative of Ghana to the United Nations addressed to
the President of the Security Council, and the attached
agreements.

The first speaker is the representative of Liberia, on
whom I now call.
