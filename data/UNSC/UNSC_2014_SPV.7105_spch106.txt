Mr. Umemoto (Japan): As I stated earlier, Japan
doubts that the Security Council is the most appropriate
forum for dealing with individual issues of the past.
However, I am obliged to take the floor again in response
to the interventions that have just been made and to
the statement made by the representative of another
delegation after I had delivered my earlier statement.
Japan's positions on the relevant points were
expressed thoroughly in my original statement this
afternoon. I would therefore just like to remind the
Council and all participants today of that fact.
