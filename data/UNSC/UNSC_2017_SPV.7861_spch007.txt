The President: On behalf of all the members of
the Security Council, I should like to thank our briefers
for their useful and informative reports, bringing to us
the complexity and scale of the challenge that is facing
the region - but also, like Fatima just did, a flavour
of what individuals are going through on the ground
as we speak, and of local campaigns and inititiatives.
I understand that, due to the late hour and the security
situation in north-eastern Nigeria, we fully understand
if Ms. Askira needs to leave the meeting, but I want
to thank her for joining us and for her excellent
contribution to this important meeting. I would like to
convey to her our support for her and her colleagues for
her invaluable input and for her efforts on a daily basis.

I shall now give the floor to the members of the

Security Council.
