The President: I thank Ambassador Mohamad
for his kind words to the presidency.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

As this is the last Council meeting under the
presidency of Viet Nam, I wish to take this opportunity
to express our sincere thanks to all my colleagues in
the Council who have extended their most valuable
cooperation to my delegation. I also wish to thank the
Security Council secretariat team for its continued
support throughout the month and to all of the other
Secretariat staff members who have worked behind the
scenes in supporting the work of the presidency.

The meeting rose at 10.50 p.m.
