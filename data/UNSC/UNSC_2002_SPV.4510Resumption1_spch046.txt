Mr. Thayeb (Indonesia): Since the Security
Council held its open-ended debate just a few days ago,
the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories has
significantly worsened, despite the fact that the Council
has recently adopted important resolutions. Can there
be light at the end of the tunnel as we witness with
deepening dismay the unfolding carnage wrought on
the Palestinian people and their territories?

As mandated by the Charter, the Council's
primary responsibility is to maintain international
peace and security. Therefore, it must remain steadfast
by insisting on the full and swift implementation of its
resolutions 1397 (2002), 1402 (2002) and 1403 (2002),
respectively. The fact that these resolutions remain
unimplemented is a cause of profound concern to my
delegation as more and more innocent civilians
continue to be killed and maimed each passing day, due
to the expanding military aggression of the occupying
Power. Moreover, it is appalling and beyond
comprehension that thousands of innocent civilians
should be denied the most basic necessities of food and
medical supplies as they and their leader, President
Yasser Arafat, remain under siege.

Such intolerable action is unjustifiable and
against international humanitarian law, basic human
rights and the norms by which civilized nations live. It
brings to the forefront the question of the
accountability and credibility of the Council's actions
regarding the less grievous circumstances of other
questions on its agenda.

My delegation strongly believes that the Security
Council must seize this opportunity and discharge its
given mandate on the situation in the Middle East,
including the question of Palestine. This should entail,
amongst other things, the urgent deployment of an
international security force to protect the civilians as a
matter of priority and to bring peace and normalcy to
these war-torn territories.
