Mr. Granovsky (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian): We are grateful to Under-Secretary-General
Bernard Miyet and to Ambassador Dahlgren for their
substantive briefings on the situation in Sierra Leone.

The Russian Federation supports the
recommendations contained in the Secretary-General's
report, in particular his proposal for the extension of the
mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra
Leone (UNOMSIL) for six months. We are satisfied that
the Government of Sierra Leone is undertaking consistent
steps in the search for a political solution to the problems.
An example of such efforts is the conduct of a
consultative campaign to draw up consensus proposals on
major policy issues, including national reconciliation.

In view of all this Government activity, the
unceasing activity of the rebels, who are guilty of many
attacks on the civilian population, appears all the more
horrendous. Thanks to the joint efforts of the Sierra
Leone authorities and the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group
(ECOMOG), we expect that in the near future the
international community will witness full normalization of
the situation in that country.

In conclusion, we would like to express our gratitude
to Ambassador Dahlgren for his effective and highly
professional leadership of the sanctions Committee
concerning Sierra Leone.
