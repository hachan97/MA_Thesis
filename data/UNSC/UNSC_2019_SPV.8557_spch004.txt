Mr. Hunter (United States of America): I thank
Mr. Mladenov, Special Coordinator for the Middle East
Peace Process, for his briefing and tireless efforts on
this portfolio.

As Special Coordinator Mladenov mentioned, the
United States, in partnership with Bahrain, will be
hosting the Peace to Prosperity economic workshop
in Manama next week. The workshop is a pivotal
opportunity to convene Government, civil society and
business leaders to share ideas, discuss strategies and
galvanize support for potential economic investments
and initiatives that could be made possible by a peace
agreement. The workshop will facilitate discussions
on an ambitious, achievable vision and framework
for a prosperous future for Palestinians, including
enhancements to economic governance, development
of human capital and facilitation of rapid private-sector
growth. We have been very clear that our full plan will
address all final-status issues. The economic plan is a
complement to the political plan.

We understand that only through a solution to the
final-status issues will the economic vision be possible.
Sustainable Palestinian economic growth is not
achievable in the current environment. The economic
vision is a road map that includes a detailed portfolio
of real projects and capacity-building programmes
that have the potential to unleash sustainable, private
sector-driven growth if and when there is peace.

We want to underscore that this is why it is so
important that everyone keep an open mind. The Council
meets here month after month. Many in this Chamber
use the same talking points to describe situations
that have not changed. What actions have positively
changed the reality on the ground? The United States
encourages all to keep an open mind, read through these
ideas and then make suggestions. All of us here today
care deeply and want to see peace between the Israelis
and Palestinians. We hope everyone here will remain
constructively engaged with us moving forward.
