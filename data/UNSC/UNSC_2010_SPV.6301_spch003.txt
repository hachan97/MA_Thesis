Mr. Rugunda (Uganda): Uganda voted in favour
of resolution 1918 (2010), on piracy in Somalia and
welcomes its adoption by the Council. Piracy is an
international problem that poses challenges to all
countries. Therefore, combating piracy requires
collective efforts and the contribution of all countries.

Uganda would like to emphasize that a more
effective and comprehensive approach to combating
piracy off the coast of Somalia would be to address its
root causes, especially the instability in mainland
Somalia. That will require greater support for the
Transitional Federal Government and building the
capacity of its institutions so that the Somali people
can take full responsibility for their own country and
their own destiny.
