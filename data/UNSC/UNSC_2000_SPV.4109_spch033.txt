The President: I thank the representative of Egypt
for his kind words addressed to me and to my country. I
also appreciate very sincerely his mention of the excellent
relations between our countries. I remember my recent
visit to Cairo and to my good friend, his Foreign
Minister, Mr. Amre Moussa, as well my meeting with his
President, Mr. Hosni Mubarak.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Belarus. I invite him to take a seat at the
Council table and to make his statement.
