Mr. Pamir (Turkey): The recent attacks in
Istanbul have reopened fresh wounds. Once again, in
the face of the most cowardly and unspeakable acts of
violence, we are confronting the unchanging truth
behind the ugly face of terrorism. We see plainly that
terrorism is a means of oppression directed at the very
existence of human life, civilization and our common
values - values distilled from the moment the human
adventure started on Earth. As a nation that had to
suffer for more than a decade through one of the most
blatant forms of this evil scourge, we called most
earnestly for decisive international action and
cooperation, long before it struck all around the world.

Just recently we were more successful in reaching
a broader understanding that we should not distinguish
between the motivations, forms and so-called causes of
terrorism. However, I cannot say that we have been as
successful in showing the same sensitivity in not
making a distinction between the victims of terrorism. I
cannot stress enough that we must all avoid falling into
that trap. Just as there are no good terrorists, there are
no second-class victims. All terrorists, therefore,
deserve to be treated in the same manner; so do the
victims of terrorism. A selective approach will prove to
be the wrong way to proceed, as terrorism has always
turned eventually against the very hands that have fed,
abetted or condoned it.

Finally, as the representative of the host nation, I
extend my condolences to my British colleague. I thank
those in the Chamber who have expressed their
sympathy. An extensive and thorough investigation is
under way and has already produced more than
circumstantial evidence.

I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for
having convened this meeting to show solidarity with
the aggrieved people of Turkey.
