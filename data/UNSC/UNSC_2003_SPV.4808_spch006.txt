Mr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): Spain
welcomes the adoption of this resolution, which we
joined in sponsoring. Its text reflects the spirit of the
Spanish draft presidential statement that my delegation
was eager to approve in the final days of our
presidency but that agenda-related reasons basically
prevented.

The resolution is necessary, realistic and relevant.
It secures the United Nations Assistance Mission for
Iraq and reaffirms the Organization's vital role in Iraq's
reconstruction. Moreover, it hails the existence of the
Governing Council as a first step towards what we all
wish for: a sovereign, stable and democratic Iraq -
ultimately, an Iraq that controls its own future in peace
and prosperity.

Finally, I should like to indicate that I agree with
the comments made by the representative of Pakistan
concerning the desirability of extending Council
discussions to all members as a general rule.
