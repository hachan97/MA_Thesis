Mr. Umarov (Kazakstan): Kazakhstan regrets
that we cannot achieve unity in the Security Council
on the two draft resolutions that were submitted today
(S/2018/516 and S/2018/520). My delegation notes the
importance of continuing to strive towards achieving
a well-balanced draft and welcomes all efforts to that
end. We appreciate the efforts of the Kuwaiti and United
States delegations in trying to reach the desired result
in the draft resolutions upon which we have just voted.

My delegation abstained in the voting on the United
States draft resolution because we still would have liked
to see a more balanced and all-embracing draft as well as
a more thorough preparatory process for consideration
and elaboration of a proposed text. Unfortunately, that
was not the case today. Moreover, we would prefer a
draft that contributes to finding common ground and
bring parties to work together towards a peaceful future.
As we always say in the Council, the only possible way
is through direct dialogue, political and diplomatic
means and confidence-building measures. To our
regret, references to peaceful means and credible and
direct negotiations were omitted in the United States
draft resolution.

Upon consideration and careful review, we believe
that the best course of action is one that avoids greater
divisiveness between the two sides and thereby further
impedes the peace process.
