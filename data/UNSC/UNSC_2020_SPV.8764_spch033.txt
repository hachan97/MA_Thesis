The President (spoke in Russian): Before I give the floor to the representative of Viet Nam, I would like to once again recall that the question that the representative of Germany referred to was not about the person who held the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, but rather about the item being considered by the Security Council. That item did not go through because it did not receive enough votes. He therefore cannot tell us that we blocked a briefer who was supposed to speak to the Council. It was an agenda item, not a speaker. Those are two different things. The question is whether someone tried to block the agenda item today, concerning the implementation of resolution 2118 (2013). Does the representative of Germany wish to speak on a point of order?
