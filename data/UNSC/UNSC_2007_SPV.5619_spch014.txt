Mr. Lacroix (France) (spoke in French): France
voted in favour of the draft resolution submitted by the
United Kingdom and the United States. We regret that
the Security Council was not able to adopt it, because
we feel that the situation in Burma calls for the
international community's serious concern with respect
to important aspects of the Security Council's
responsibilities.

Conflict persists between the Burmese army and
various armed factions, with repercussions beyond the
country's borders. Refugees have fled the country, in
particular to Thailand, leading to border incidents and
facilitating drug production and trafficking from
Burma. The Council cannot remain indifferent to the
situation of civilians in conflict zones where such
serious disturbances are taking place.

The deadlock of the political process in Burma is
not sustainable in the long term and can only aggravate
the situation. There is a real danger to the stability of the
country and, beyond, of the region, which remains fragile.
Only a genuine process of national reconciliation
involving all parties, in particular the National League
for Democracy and representatives of ethnic minorities,
can offer the country the democracy, peace and
development to which all Burmese aspire. In that context,
France regrets in particular the increasing number of
obstacles set up to the work of the United Nations and
international non-governmental organizations.

With its European Union partners, France will
continue closely to follow the situation in Burma,
including with regard to human rights. We will also
ensure that the provisions of Security Council
resolutions relating to the protection of civilians and
children in armed conflict are respected.

In conclusion, France reaffirms its full support
for the Secretary-General's mission of good offices and
pays tribute to the work of Mr. Ibrahim Gambari in that
regard. My delegation stresses the importance it
attaches to that mission being continued.
