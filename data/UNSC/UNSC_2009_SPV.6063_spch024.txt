Mr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): My delegation
would like to have seen a resolution with more clear-
cut language, providing for an immediate ceasefire and
an immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza,
which we consider essential for putting an early end to
the current crisis and relieving the innocent Palestinian
people of their suffering and numerous hardships.

However, we are aware of the urgency of the
situation and the urgent need for action by the Council
in the face of the continuously deteriorating situation,
especially the humanitarian situation on the ground.
We also note that the resolution we have just adopted
does contain measures that are comprehensive and
balanced and that, if implemented with good faith,
would contribute to the resolution of the ongoing crisis
and restore or otherwise create conditions conducive to
bringing the Middle East peace process back on track
towards a lasting solution based on the existence of
two States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in
peace, with secure and recognized borders, in
accordance with the relevant Security Council
resolutions. Therefore, Viet Nam decided to support
and vote in favour of resolution 1860 (2009). We look
forward to contributing to efforts to ensure its effective
implementation.
