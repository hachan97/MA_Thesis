Mr. Qin Huasun (China) (spoke in Chinese): We
have listened attentively to the statements that have just
been made, every one of which expressed sympathy and
condolences to the Chinese Government and the families
of the victims. For this, we wish to express our thanks.

However, we have also heard an absurd argument
made to the effect that, as the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) did not intentionally attack the
Chinese Embassy and its diplomats, it cannot be charged
with violating the Convention on the Prevention and
Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected
Persons, including Diplomatic Agents. We were most
astonished by the fact that this remark was made by a
senior diplomat.

Facts speak louder than words. Deliberate or not,
NATO's action was a blatant flouting of international law.
Are we to understand that a killer, merely by arguing that
he did not kill deliberately, can escape the punishment of
law? I wish to reiterate here that NATO must shoulder
full responsibility for its action.

I also wish to inform all members of the Council
through you, Sir, that the Chinese delegation has
distributed a draft presidential statement. We hope that the
Security Council will act on it as soon as possible.
