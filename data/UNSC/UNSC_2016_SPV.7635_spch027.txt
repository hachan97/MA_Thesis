Mr. Steinmeier: I do not want to repeat myself
and my statement from the beginning. I will avoid
responding to representatives' comments. I only want
to thank you, Mr. President, for your kind invitation
and the members for all their comments. We are really
grateful for members' support regarding our priorities
for the chairmanship of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in 2016 and for their
readiness for cooperation, which they have offered in
this Chamber.

Members must ensure that we remain engaged in
using the tools of the OSCE in order to improve the
security situation on the European continent, especially
as we progress on the way to the full implementation of
the Minsk agreements. As our friend the Ambassador
of France announced, we will be meeting in Paris on
Thursday. I hope that we will achieve some progress,
especially on the security situation and on our
discussion on the election.

The meeting rose at 12.05 p.rn.
