Mr. Lacroix (France) (spoke in French): I would
like to thank the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General for his comments.

I listened very closely to the comments of the
Permanent Representative of Cote d'Ivoire. We did not
intend to speak at this meeting, but the comments made
by Mr. Djedje, as Council members can well
understand, came as some surprise to the French
delegation.

France, like all other members of the Security
Council, is fully committed to supporting Cote d'Ivoire
so that all of end phases of the crisis can unfold in the
best possible conditions, in particular the holding of
elections within the established time frame. France is
contributing on the ground as well, through military
and financial contributions to the collective
international action, and it is determined to continue to
do so. The French authorities are committed to
ensuring a successful end to the crisis in Cote d'Ivoire,
which is, in point of fact, a country that is close to us
and with which we have very close ties.

I do not understand what is behind the comments
that have been made, but in any event, if they can be
interpreted to mean that France is distancing itself from
the objectives of the Security Council, I wish to state
most emphatically that we do not agree with such an
interpretation. France is resolved to pursue its
activities, in the framework of the Security Council and
on the basis of its resolutions, to assist Cote d'Ivoire to
end the crisis and help it to meet its deadlines, in
particular the electoral timetable. I solemnly reaffirm
that commitment before the members of the Security
Council.
