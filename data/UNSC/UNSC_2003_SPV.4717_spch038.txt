Mr. Ingolfsson (Iceland): Let me at the outset
refer to my statement in the Council some three weeks
ago stating the general views of the Government of
Iceland on the serious issue under consideration today.

My Government is deeply concerned about the
situation prevailing in Iraq, and still hopes that the
Security Council will manage to reunite in following
up resolution 1441 (2002). No effort must be spared to
maintain the resolve of the Council. A failure in this
respect would have unforeseeable consequences for the
crucial role the Council has in maintaining peace and
security in the world.

Speaking in the General Assembly last
September, my Foreign Minister underlined that full
implementation of Security Council resolutions is
imperative. He also commended the consensus that was
emerging in the Council about how to deal with
defiance of Security Council resolutions. A
constructive approach from the Council is desperately
needed again today.

It is the view of my Government that the Iraqi
Government has not actively cooperated with the
inspectors and is thus in violation of resolution 1441
(2002). The international community has tolerated the
relentless obstruction of inspections for 12 years now.
It is therefore high time for the United Nations to show
determination; the credibility of the United Nations is
at stake.

The Government of Iceland reiterates its hope for
a peaceful solution. A war in Iraq is a last resort. It is
up to the Iraqi Government to avoid conflict by
disarming quickly and in a credible manner.

The international community must show its
resolve and the United Nations its strength. The
handling of this matter must leave no one in doubt
about the authority and ability of our Organization to
enforce its decisions.
