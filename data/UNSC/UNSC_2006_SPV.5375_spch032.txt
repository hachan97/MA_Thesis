The President: I shall now briefly take the floor
in my national capacity to respond to the statement
made by the representative of Venezuela.

I want to inform the Council, as we have before,
that Mr. Posada, whom he mentioned, was detained on
17 May 2005 after entering the United States without
inspection. He remains in custody while his case is
processed in the United States legal system.
Venezuela's extradition request is under review in
accordance with the bilateral extradition treaty and
United States law, and I do not plan to waste any time
responding to the rest of the Venezuelan statement.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

It appears that none of the three Committee
chairmen wishes to respond to questions or comments
made in the course of the meeting. We appreciate the
work of all three Committee chairmen, and we
appreciate the indulgence of everybody here today.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 2.50 pm.
