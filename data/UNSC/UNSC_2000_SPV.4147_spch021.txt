Mr. van Walsum (Netherlands): I am grateful to
Mr. Annabi, and I apologize for inflicting such detailed
questions on him, knowing full well that he has in fact
been briefing us all day long.

Mr. Annabi has now supplied us with further
information on the reductions in the military
component of the United Nations Transitional
Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) that are
currently envisaged. I would like to say only that,
obviously, we appreciate receiving that information,
but that my delegation continues to insist on a proper
discussion of the military and security situation in East
Timor, either in an open Council meeting or in
consultations of the whole, before any of these
envisaged decisions become final.
