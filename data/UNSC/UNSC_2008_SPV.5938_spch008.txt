Mr. DeLaurentis (United States of America):
The United States thanks Special Representative of the
Secretary-General Martin for his briefing. We are
pleased to support the Government of Nepal's request
for an extension of the United Nations Mission in
Nepal (UNMIN) at a reduced level so that it can
complete remaining elements of its mandate in
carrying out the peace process. Today, I would like to
make four points.

First, the United States strongly supports the
United Nations Mission in Nepal, commends the work
of Special Representative Martin and his staff and
looks forward to working with him to complete the
remaining portions of the UNMIN mandate, especially
with regard to the management of arms and armed
personnel.
Secondly, the United States urges all of Nepal's
political parties to maintain their resolve to settle their
differences through peaceful dialogue so that the future
of the Nepalese people may be characterized by
democracy and economic development.

Thirdly, the United States also strongly
encourages the new Government to address, to the
extent possible, the concerns of historically
disadvantaged groups, including in the Terai, so that all
parties and groups committed to a new democratic
Nepal will share equally in the process of nation-
building.

Finally, the United States has committed itself to
providing nearly $10 million in assistance in support of
Nepal's transition to democracy in areas such as
security sector reform, conflict resolution, civil society,
supporting legal institutions and political parties. We
urge other donors to offer maximum support to ensure
that Nepal makes a successful transition.

We look forward to the continued work of
UNMIN and to the reports of the Secretary-General in
that regard. We remain committed to helping ensure
that UNMIN successfully carries out its full mandate.
