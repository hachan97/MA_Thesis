Mr. Vassilakis (Greece): My delegation has just
voted in favour of resolution 1687 (2006), which
extends the mandate of the United Nations
Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus for a further six-month
period, because it considers that the presence of the
Peacekeeping Force on the island continues to be
indispensable and imperative owing to the continuing
presence of approximately 40,000 Turkish troops on
the island and the security threat that that represents for
international peace and security.

There is no doubt that it is our common wish and
desire around this table that a just and permanent
solution be found to the problem of Cyprus on the
basis of Security Council resolutions so that the island
can be reunified and the two communities can enjoy a
common future, to the benefit of the maintenance of
peace and security both on the island and in the region.

The Secretary-General is about to dispatch the
Under-Secretary-General of Political Affairs to the
region in an attempt to strengthen the ongoing efforts
on the ground and to assess the political situation in
and around Cyprus and the prospects for a full
resumption of his good offices mission with the two
communities. We regret to note, however, that the text
adopted here today unfortunately does not convey a
sufficiently clear and strong message as to the basis,
the scope and the objectives of United Nations efforts
for a fair and lasting settlement of the problem of
Cyprus.

That is why Greece had insisted on the need to
clarify, in the sixth preambular paragraph - in which
the Council urges "progress towards the resumption of
negotiations for a comprehensive settlement" - that it
should be reaffirmed that those negotiations have to
take place between the two communities.
