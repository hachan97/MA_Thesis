Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): South Africa has
always been deeply concerned about the deteriorating
political, security and humanitarian situation in Syria.
We emphasize that there is a need for the violence to
cease. South Africa strongly supports the efforts of
Joint Special Envoy Kofi Annan, which have the
ultimate aim of committing all sides to peaceful
dialogue in order to promote an all-inclusive process of
negotiations leading to a political outcome that
responds to the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian
people. The situation in Syria remains fragile. We
reiterate our call for all sides to the conflict to fully
implement their commitments under the six-point plan
of Joint Special Envoy Kofi Annan.

We welcome the fact that the Syrian Government
has started to implement its commitments under the
plan. We call on all parties, including the opposition, to
sustain the ceasefire. In that regard, South Africa
supports the call made by Joint Special Envoy Annan
regarding the urgent deployment of a United Nations
observer mission to verify and monitor the ceasefire.
We call on all sides to the conflict to guarantee the
safety and freedom of movement of such a mission,
once it is deployed.

We are deeply pleased that the Council has been
able to unanimously adopt resolution 2042 (2012)
today, providing for the deployment of the advance
team of the United Nations observer mission.

As we work towards the resolution of the Syrian
crisis, it is vital that the international community
respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria
and work with the Syrian people to bring about a
peaceful political solution to their crisis.
