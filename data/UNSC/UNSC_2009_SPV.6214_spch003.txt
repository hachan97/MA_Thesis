The President: I thank Ms. Landgren for her
briefing.

As this would seem likely to be the last time we
will be able to hear and meet with the Permanent
Representative of Nepal in the framework of the
Security Council, I would like to associate myself on
behalf of the Council and in my national capacity with
Ms. Landgren's statement. Our cooperation with
Ambassador Acharya has always been excellent, and
we are extremely grateful for the opportunity we have
had to work with him in these past years.

I now call on the Permanent Representative of
Nepal.
