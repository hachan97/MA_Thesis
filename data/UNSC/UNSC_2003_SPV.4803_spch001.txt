first meeting of the Security Council for the month of

tribute, on behalf of the Council, to His Excellency Mr.
Inocencio Arias, Permanent Representative of Spain to
the United Nations, for his service as President of the
Security Council for the month of July 2003. I am sure
I speak for all members of the Council in expressing
deep appreciation to Ambassador Arias for the great
diplomatic skill with which he conducted the Council's
business last month.
