The President: I now take the floor in my capacity
as representative of Germany.

I would ask the representative of the Syrian
Arab Republic if he would subscribe to the demand
under international humanitarian law that the Syrian
Government guarantee and support the safe, voluntary,
dignified and well-informed return of refugees to
their homes.

I resume my functions as President of the Security
Council.

I give the floor to the representative of the Syrian
Arab Republic.
