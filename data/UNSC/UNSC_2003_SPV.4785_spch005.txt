The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Ambassador Aguilar Zinser for the kind words he
addressed to me. On behalf of the Council, I wish to
express to him our gratitude, first, for his willingness
to head the mission and, secondly, for his effective
leadership of it.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.
