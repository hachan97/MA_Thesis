The President: The next speaker inscribed on my
list is the representative of Egypt. I invite him to take a
seat at the Council table.

If I may be somewhat presumptuous, I assume that
at the conclusion of a long and distinguished diplomatic
career, this may be the last occasion that Ambassador
Elaraby will have to address the Council, where, of
course, he so ably represented his country only recently.
I believe that I can say, on behalf of the Council, that we
shall all miss his company and wise counsel.

I give the floor to the representative of Egypt.
