Mr. Belle (Belgium) (spoke in French): Belgium
welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 1773
(2007). As a troop contributor, Belgium obviously fully
supports the resolution, which extends the current
mandate of the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) for a 12-month period, until 31
August 2008. In our view, it is undeniable that
UNIFIL has been and continues to be a stabilizing
element in southern Lebanon and in the zone.

By adopting this resolution, the Security Council
is sending a clear and strong signal: it is endorsing the
undeniable initial success of this mission and
reaffirming its confidence in UNIFIL with regard to the
discharge of its mandate. In addition to condemning
the attacks against UNIFIL, the resolution recalls that
the security of UNIFIL's contingents and personnel
remains paramount for the fulfilment of its mission.
