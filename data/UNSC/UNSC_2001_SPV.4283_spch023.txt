The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank the
representative of Burkina Faso for his kind words
addressed to me and to my country.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is our
former colleague in the Security Council, the
representative of Canada. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
