Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I will be very brief.
We have heard a great deal of support for the Special
Envoy in the Chamber. Let us look to that to hold
between now and 19 November. I have a question about
Idlib. The Syrian Ambassador referred to the Syrian
authorities retaking - I repeat, retaking - Idlib. That
would cut across the agreement that the Russians and
the Turks have made with regard to Idlib. I would like
to know if the Russian and Turkish agreement on Idlib
still holds and how long it is likely to hold.
