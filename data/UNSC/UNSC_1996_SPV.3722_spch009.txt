Mr. Gomersall (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland): The United Kingdom welcomes
the draft resolution and intends to vote in favour of it. We
pay tribute to the United Nations Angola Verification
Mission (UNAVEM. III), to the Secretary-General's
Special Representative and to all the others who have
helped the parties in Angola to get to this point in the
realization of the Lusaka Protocol.

The Council, in agreeing to a further final period for
UNAVEM. III, makes it as clear as ever that the
responsibility for consolidating the peace rests on the
shoulders of the Government of Angola and of UNITA
themselves. Both parties must work to form a
Government of National Unity and Reconciliation. We
welcome the fact that UNITA has taken the final,
symbolic step of declaring the quartering of all its troops
and given up its weapons.

We also welcome reports that the Government will
proceed immediately to incorporate the nine UNITA
generals currently in Luanda into the Angolan Armed
Forces. Both sides must now complete the process of
demobilization of former combatants.

If these two tasks are completed, the international
community and my Government will continue to help
Angola to secure its future within the community of
southern African nations. There is much the United
Nations can and should do to assist Angola in dealing
with the challenges of reconstruction, rehabilitation and
national reconciliation. A continuing United Nations
presence following the departure of UNAVEM. III, as the
Secretary-General has proposed, will also probably have
an important role to play.

Finally, despite the slow progress in getting to this
point, we believe that this is a good example of why the
maintenance and, indeed, the strengthening of the political
and material resources of the United Nations conflict-
resolution and peacekeeping capabilities are vitally
important.
