Mr. Sharma: Thank you, Mr. President, for
giving me this opportunity to make a few
observations - very briefly, naturally.

First, I thank all delegations for their advice and
guidance, which we will take into account in our work,
as well as for the kind and complimentary words
directed towards UNMISET and towards me. This is a
great encouragement. I will communicate these
sentiments to my colleagues after my return. I am
convinced that the confidence expressed by the Council
in the work they are doing will further galvanize them
into giving even a bit more of themselves to the
achievement of the goals set by the Council for
UNMISET. I acknowledge, with appreciation, the
commitment and solidarity of the entire team I have the
honour to lead, and the spirit which they have shown in
its work for the people of Timor-Leste.

I would also like to join the tribute paid to the
work done by Sergio Vieira de Mello, a true friend of
Timor-Leste, to whose memory we pay homage. I try
to build on his pioneering contribution and on the
foundations prepared by the leadership of Timor-Leste
in cooperation with him.

Delegations have asked a few questions and
requested clarification and information. I have noted
these, and will be in touch with the delegations
concerned. In view of the time, and also the need to
maintain my popularity, I would like not to impose
further on the Council at this moment.
