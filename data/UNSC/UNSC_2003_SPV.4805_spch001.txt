The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Australia, Fiji, Japan, New Zealand
and Papua New Guinea in which they request to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Aisi (Papua New Guinea) took a seat at the Council table;
Mr. Dauth (Australia), Mr. Savua (Fiji),
Mr. Motomura (Japan) and Mr. MacKay (New Zealand) took the seats reserved for them at the
side of the Council Chamber.

The President (spoke in Arabic): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Noel Sinclair,
Head of the United Nations Political Office in
Bougainville.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Sinclair to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Noel Sinclair, Head of the United
Nations Political Office in Bougainville. I now give
him the floor.
