Mrs. Haley (United States of America): This issue
has become a repeated problem. We continue to think
that there is a separation between peace and security
and human rights, and there is not. If we go back in
history, it shows that any country that does not take
care of its people ends up in conflict. We have seen that
in multiple cases in multiple places.

As much as the Secretary-General and the Council
talk about prevention when it comes to conflict,
prevention is about how a country treats its people as
well. If it starts to treat its people carelessly or abuse
them, it will easily abuse other countries, and that is
what we are seeing happen in North Korea. So while
I understand the concerns of some Council members,
I think it is extremely important that if we are to stay
true to our word on prevention, then we must stay true
to our word that prevention also includes human rights
and the ability to call out countries when they commit
abuses like the ones we are seeing.

I therefore suggest that not only should we do this
today, but we should be doing it more often with other
countries when we see such things coming up. We have
seen it in Venezuela and Syria. If we truly care about
prevention, human rights have to be at the heart of it.
