Mr. Lewicki (Poland): Poland welcomes the
adoption of resolution 2414 (2018), which extends
the mandate of the United Nations Mission for the
Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). We
encourage both parties to cooperate closely both with
the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General and
MINURSO to avert any possible flare-up of tensions.

In that regard, Poland reiterates its support for
an inclusive, durable and acceptable solution to the
conflict, developed in accordance with the purposes
and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.

Let me also express our full support to the
Secretary- General's Personal Envoy, Mr. Horst Kohler.
We believe that with his dedicated efforts and through
negotiations with all parties, neighbouring States
and other stakeholders, there is a chance to achieve a
lasting solution.
