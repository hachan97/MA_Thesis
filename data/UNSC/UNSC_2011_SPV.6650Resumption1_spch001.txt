The President: Under rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure, I invite the
representatives of Armenia and Azerbaijan to
participate in the meeting. I wish to remind all speakers
to limit their statements to no more than four minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Israel.
