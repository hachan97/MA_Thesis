Mr. Karev (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian): My delegation attaches great importance to the
International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, whose
activities we believe to be contributing to general efforts to
restore peace in the region. Given the need to enhance the
effectiveness of the work of the Tribunal, our delegation
supports the request made by the President of the
International Tribunal for the establishment of a third Trial
Chamber. We trust that this will expedite the activities of
the Tribunal in carrying out the tasks assigned to it.

We understand that the reference in the draft
resolution to Chapter VII of the Charter is purely a
technicality and will not set a precedent for the Security
Council's consideration of any similar situation.
