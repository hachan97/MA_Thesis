Ms. Del Ponte (spoke in French): I shall be very
brief, as President Meron has already answered almost
all the questions. I should just like to touch upon two
issues.

First, I believe that the Security Council's attention
to our activities is very important. I would ask the Council
to continue its attention to the work of the Tribunal and
the Office of the Prosecutor of the International
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, as this is
a very delicate moment. Therefore the success of our
completion strategy will depend upon the support that
the Council extends to our work.

Secondly, as for the possibility of States'
assuming cases, I shall not go into detail. I simply wish
to note the importance of States' being able to take on
such cases, because on the day when the local judicial
authorities in Serbia and Montenegro, Croatia and
Bosnia and Herzegovina are in a position to judge and
try accused persons of any ethnic group, that is when
we shall be able to say that reconciliation has been
achieved in those countries.

We are very far from that, but the beginnings are
promising. Prosecutorial specialists in war crimes have
been appointed and are currently drafting laws. We are
already cooperating with these prosecutors, who have
come to us. We assist them in their work and cooperate
usefully with them. We also support their
investigations, because it is important in those
countries that cases and, above all, investigations be
undertaken with the utmost respect for equity.

I believe that next year we will be able to be more
specific. The transfer of cases will begin only in 2005.
When we complete our investigations, we will be able
to begin those transfers and be more specific next year.
I can say, however, that the beginnings have been very
positive and we are following them up.
