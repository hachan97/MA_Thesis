We thank Russia for initiating the important draft resolution S/2020/1054 to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000). We deeply regret that such a crucial draft resolution did not reach consensus at such a pivotal moment. History will record that, for the first time, there was a draft resolution under the agenda of women and peace and security that failed to be adopted. We understand that many substantial elements should have been attached as additional values into the draft resolution, as repeatedly advised by some delegations. However, it would be a disservice to gloss over and disregard the draft resolution, which has a distinct potential to advance the women and peace and security agenda constructively. It complements all previous Security Council resolutions on the women and peace and security agenda. Therefore, Indonesia firmly decided to vote in favour of it. Indonesia remains committed to strongly supporting the full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), resolution 2538 (2020) and its subsequent resolutions. All such resolutions are strong foundations to promote women's full, equal and meaningful participation in preventing conflict and sustaining peace. We are, and will continue to be, actively involved in constructive initiatives and activities, raised by States Members of the United Nations and other relevant stakeholders, that strengthen the advancement of the women and peace and security agenda. In that regard, Indonesia believes that we must work together in the spirit of unity, solidarity and mutual understanding. The women and peace and security agenda is crucial for all countries and all women across the world. All countries are therefore the owners of this important agenda.
