Sir Emyr Jones Parry (United Kingdom): The
United Kingdom welcomes the unanimous adoption of
this resolution to extend the mandate of the United
Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). It
is undeniable that the situation in Cyprus has evolved,
not only since the referenda of 24 April but also over
the 40 years that this operation has been on the island.
We therefore support the Secretary-General's decision
to conduct a comprehensive review of UNFICYP's role
and to make recommendations in that regard. We look
forward to early consideration of those
recommendations by the Security Council with a view
to tailoring UNFICYP to reflect current requirements.

The successful conclusion of the Council's
deliberations on UNFICYP today will now allow the
Council to turn its attention to consideration of the
Secretary-General's report on his mission of good
offices in Cyprus (S/2004/437), which the United
Kingdom has welcomed.
