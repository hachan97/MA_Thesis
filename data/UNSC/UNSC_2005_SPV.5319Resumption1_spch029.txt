Mr. Buff (International Committee of the Red Cross): I should just like to tell you once again,
Mr. President, how much the International Committee
of the Red Cross - and particularly our Vice-
President, who had to leave - appreciated your
invitation and the opportunity for the Committee to
address the Council this morning on this extremely
important issue.
