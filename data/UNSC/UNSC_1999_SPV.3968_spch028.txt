The President (interpretation from Spanish): I shall
now call on Under-Secretary-General Vieira de Mello to
respond to comments and questions.

I wish first to make a very brief comment. It is clear
that we are not going to exhaust every aspect addressed
here today, but I believe that it is only fair to call once
again on the Under-Secretary-General for some brief
comments since, as members know, we still have another
meeting to convene on an equally important item.
