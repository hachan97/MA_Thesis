The President (spoke in French): I thank the
representative of Saudi Arabia for the kind words
addressed to me.

There are a number of speakers remaining on my
list who have not yet taken the floor. With the
Council's agreement, I propose now to suspend the
meeting. I would like to invite Council members to
meet with me in the consultation room in 10 minutes.

The meeting was suspended at 6.35 p.m. and
resumed at 8.40 p.m.

The President (spoke in French): The next
speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of
Algeria. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table.
