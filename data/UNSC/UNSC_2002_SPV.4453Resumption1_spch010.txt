The President: I thank the representative of the
Russian Federation for his kind words addressed to me.

I will now give the floor to four speakers from the
list of non-Council members. The next speaker
inscribed on this list is the representative of Poland. I
invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to
make his statement.
