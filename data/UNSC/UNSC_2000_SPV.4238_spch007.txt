The President: I thank the Vice-Prime Minister
of Guinea-Bissau for his very comprehensive and
informative statement, which will greatly enhance the
quality of our debate. I think that one of the lessons
learned in post-conflict situations is that for post-
conflict peace-building to be successful it has to be
inclusive. I commend the Vice-Prime Minister on the
fact that his delegation is indeed very inclusive: it
includes representatives from the private sector - both
for-profit and non-profit- and from parliament;
I think that is a very good sign that post-conflict peace-
building will be successful, because it will be
inclusive.
