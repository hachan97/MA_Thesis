Mr. Queta (Guinea-Bissau) (interpretation from French): It seems that for the first time in its history Haiti
has democratic institutions. The United Nations has
played a very important role in making it possible for
Haitians to express peacefully their desire to establish a
political regime that is a manifestation of the will of the

 

people. The way that the elections of 7 February 1996 were
conducted in the country is emblematic of that will.

My country believes that much progress has been
made in Haiti, thanks to the assistance of the international
community. However, the hardest tasks are still to come,
including the training of a new police force capable of
guaranteeing on its own the stable climate and the security
necessary for the consolidation of democracy; the
revitalization of the judicial system; and the needed
coordination of the activities led by the United Nations
bodies working for reconciliation and economic
reconstruction in Haiti.

My country believes that a complete withdrawal of
United Nations observers could jeopardize everything the
Haitian people have achieved so far with the support and
assistance of the international community.

Therefore, my delegation supports the continued
presence of the United Nations in that country through the
establishment of the United Nations Support Mission in
Haiti (UNSMIH) until 30 November 1996. We will
therefore vote in favour of the draft resolution before us.

Allow me to thank through you, Mr. President, the
Secretary-General for his devotion to the cause of the
Haitian people. We also wish to pay tribute to all the
countries, particularly the United States and Canada, and
organizations that have been making efforts to assist in the
consolidation of democracy in Haiti.
