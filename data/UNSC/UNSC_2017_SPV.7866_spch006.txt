Mr. Llorentty Soliz (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): Bolivia takes the floor
to recognize the work undertaken by Senegal and of
subregional and regional organizations with respect to
the issue at hand. We also draw attention to our belief
that the negotiating process was regrettably hasty. We
understand the urgency of the situation, but we believe
that prior negotiations could have facilitated a better
exchange of views and improved the text of resolution
2337 (2017), which we adopted today.
Pursuant to the first preambular paragraph of
the resolution, we are committed to the sovereignty,
independence, territorial integrity and unity of The
Islamic Republic of The Gambia. Bolivia believes that
we must continue to pursue mediation efforts and good
offices to identify a peaceful solution to this problem.
We do not feel that at this stage this situation poses
a threat to international peace and security. Bolivia
therefore believes that the adoption of the resolution
cannot and should not be interpreted to represent
Security Council support for or endorsement of the use
of force. To that end, we would need a specific resolution
providing such a mandate or endorsing such action.
