Mrs. Perceval (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish):
Argentina supported resolution 2146 (2014) bearing in
mind, in particular, the request from the Government
of Libya to receive assistance from the international
community at a stage in its history in which the latter
finds itself committed to contribute to the country's
stability, institutional rebuilding and economic and
social development. In that context, in the light of the
principle of a State's permanent sovereignty over its
natural resources, we also took into account the need to
safeguard Libya's natural resources.

At the same time, we highlight that the step that
has been authorized is of an exceptional nature when
it comes to the basic norms concerning the exclusive

jurisdiction of flag States over their vessels on the high
seas. In that connection, we underscore that, as clearly
set out in the text of the resolution, the authorization
that has been granted is limited to vessels that have
been identified by the Security Council Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1970 (2011). It does
not cover other vessels or any other situation, including
when it comes to previous sanctions, nor does it provide
a basis for customary international law.

We also bore in mind that the authorization is in the
context of the Council's authority, but it is also firmly
within the parameters of existing international law.
That body of law includes international humanitarian
law and human rights law, as well as other aspects
of international law. And we were mindful that, in
accordance with the exceptional nature of this measure,
the current authorization extends for a period of one
year. We understand that, in the normal course of events,
it should be superceded by another form of cooperation
with Libya that makes it possible for that country to
adequately respond to a situation that is essentially the
responsibility of an individual State.
