The President (spoke in French): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to His Excellency
Mr. Alexander Stubb, Chairman-in-Office of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Finland.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

On behalf of the Council, I extend a warm
welcome to His Excellency Mr. Alexander Stubb and
invite him to take a seat at the Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in response to a letter dated 4 September 2008
from the Permanent Representative of Finland to the
United Nations, addressed to the President of the
Security Council and contained in document

At this meeting the Security Council will hear a
briefing by His Excellency Mr. Alexander Stubb,
Chairman-in-Office of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe and Minister for Foreign
Affairs of Finland. I now give him the floor.
