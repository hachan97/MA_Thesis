Mr. Harrison (United Kingdom): Since the
representative of France will be speaking on behalf of
the European Union, I will make just a few points.

My delegation welcomed the successful and
peaceful conduct of the elections in Bosnia last
Saturday. They were a testament to how far its people
have come since the Dayton Accords were signed five
years ago. The elections were efficiently organized and
well run. Even the nationalist parties focused on jobs,
the economy and corruption.

The official results will not be available for some
time, but we expect all those elected to take forward
the Dayton agenda, including refugee return, anti-
corruption measures and economic reform. All the
nationalist parties know what is expected ofthem. With
Governments in Croatia and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia committed to the Dayton Accords, there has
never been a better time for progress.
