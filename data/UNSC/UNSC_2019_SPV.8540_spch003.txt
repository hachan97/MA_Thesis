Mr. Pecsteen de Buytswerve (Belgium) (spoke in French): Belgium supports the extension of the arms
embargo in Libya. However, it regrets and denounces the
systematic violations that are currently being observed.
Maintaining the embargo is essential in the light of the
ongoing armed violence in Libya. Belgium calls on all
actors in the Libyan crisis to respect the embargo, at
the risk of contributing further to the deterioration of
the situation.

Belgium is of the opinion that there can be no
military solution in Libya. I echo my British colleague
in calling for an immediate ceasefire and a return to a
process of dialogue, under the auspices of the United
Nations. I hope that our Council will speak out as soon
as possible.
