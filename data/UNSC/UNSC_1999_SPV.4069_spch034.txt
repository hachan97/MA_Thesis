Mr. Jelavic (Bosnia and Herzegovina) (spoke in Croatian; interpretation furnished by the delegation): I
would like to express my gratitude at being invited to this
meeting, at which we have had the opportunity to
reaffirm our obligation and commitment to the building of
a multi-ethnic and democratic community in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.

Members of the Council have told us in their
statements that we will have the Council's support in the
future, as well as the support of other organizations of the
international community. We fully support the initiative
of the United Kingdom's Ambassador for full and
continuous cooperation between the Security Council, the
United Nations in general and the Presidency of Bosnia
and Herzegovina.

By adopting the New York Declaration, we the
Members of the Presidency have committed ourselves to
certain obligations and duties. We see this as another
success in the implementation of the Dayton Peace
Agreement.

I would once again like to express my gratitude to
you, Mr. President, and the Council for your invitation
and for the interest you have shown in our problems and
in our reality today and in the future.
