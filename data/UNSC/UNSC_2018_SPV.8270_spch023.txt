Mr. Blok (Netherlands): We have heard the
remarks of the representative of the Russian Federation
with regard to Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, but we
actually heard nothing new. We are aware that Russia's
spokespersons and State-controlled media routinely try
to discredit details ofthe investigation, call into question
the independence, professionalism and impartiality of
the Joint Investigation Team and continue to spread
impossible alternative theories about the downing of
Flight MH-17. For the relatives of the victims, that
is extremely painful. It is very disappointing that
even in this Chamber, Russia's representative has not
acknowledged the hard facts that the Joint Investigation
Team has established based on irrefutable evidence. So
far, the Russian authorities have not shown the slightest
interest in achieving truth, justice and accountability,
as demanded by resolution 2166 (2014).

I would also like to remind the Council that our
efforts to establish an international tribunal through
the Council under Chapter VII of the Charter of the
United Nations were blocked by a Russian veto. To us,
that shows how important it is that Russia enter into
bilateral talks with the Netherlands and Australia, since
they are the proper forum in which to discuss Russia's
responsibility for its part in the downing of Flight MH-
17. We therefore urge the Russian Federation to accept
our invitation to engage in such talks in relation to
the State's responsibility for its part in the downing of
Flight MH-17 on 17 July 2014.
