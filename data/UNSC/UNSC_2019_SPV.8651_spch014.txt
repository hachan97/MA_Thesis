Mr. Jamroz (Poland): Poland welcomes the
adoption of resolution 2494 (2019). We voted in favour in
order to express our gratitude for the work of Mr. Horst
Kohler as the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General
for Western Sahara. His dedication and tireless efforts
aimed at reinvigorating the political process gave us
hope that a political solution to the question of Western
Sahara is possible.

In that regard, we look forward to the appointment
of a new Personal Envoy to pursue the United Nations-
led political process. We believe in a political solution
that would be inclusive, durable and acceptable to all
parties to the dispute and that is based on the purposes
and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.

Poland commends the role of the United Nations
Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara
(MINURSO) in maintaining peace and stability and
supporting the peace process. We believe that the
resolution adopted today by the Security Council is an
important step in advancing this process. In that regard,
I would like to thank the United States as penholder
for its efforts during the negotiations. We welcome the
fact that today the Security Council decided to extend
MINURSO's mandate for 12 months. We believe
that this mandate should be maintained until reliable
progress has been achieved.
