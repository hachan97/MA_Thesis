Mr. Sipaco Ribala (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in Spanish): My delegation would like to thank the
briefers and acknowledge the quality of the work they
carry out. In addition to the difficulties faced by the
various peacekeeping missions, they must combat
organized crime - in many cases financed by the
illegal exploitation of natural resources - as well as
ensure the safety of civilians, where the fight against
sexual exploitation and other great scourges also
become daily components of their task.

However, our delegation is interested in knowing
whether there are any conflicts with local police with
regard to competencies when it comes to investigating
or designing operations? Moreover, in relation to the
terrorist groups that are fuelled by the sale of narcotics
and the payment of ransoms, is there no method of
effective international cooperation that would allow
us to cut off supplies from third countries more easily,
thereby hindering the livelihoods of such groups? In
addition to coordinating with a country's local police
when dealing with terrorist groups, such as Boko
Haram and others, we believe that there should be better
coordinated cooperation with the police of the countries
of the subregion in order to guarantee successful and
more sustainable operations.
