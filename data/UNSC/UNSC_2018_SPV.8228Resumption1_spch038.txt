Mr. Alotaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I would
like to start by thanking Sweden for its efforts and
attempts to achieve rapprochement and to smooth over
the differences among the members of the Security
Council. We are disappointed by the Council's inability
to reach consensus on this important matter and by
the fact that the divisions among Council members
unfortunately continue.

We abstained in the voting, despite the fact that
the gist of draft resolution S/2018/322 calls for an
investigation into what took place in Douma, which
is what we called for. The investigation should be
undertaken by an international, independent and
impartial body, which in this case is the Organization
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).
However, the OPCW Fact-finding Mission will go
to Syria anyway, and the Council welcomed that
fact yesterday. There is therefore no need for a draft
resolution. What we are looking for is an international,
independent, neutral and professional body or
mechanism that would investigate the incident and
identify the party that has used chemical weapons, if
it indeed determines that chemical weapons have been
used. That approach will enable the Council to hold the
perpetrators accountable, in accordance with resolution
2118 (2013).
