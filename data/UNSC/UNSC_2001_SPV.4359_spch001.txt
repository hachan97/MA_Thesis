The President (spoke in Spanish): I would like to
inform the Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Belgium, the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia in which they request to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Sahovic
(Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) took a seat at
the Council table; Mr. De Ruyt (Belgium) and
Mr. Kerim (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) took the seats reservedfor him at the
side ofthe Council Chamber.

The President (spoke in Spanish): In the absence
of objection, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Jean-Marie
Guehenno, Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping
Operations.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Guehenno to take a seat at the
Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

At this meeting the Council will hear a briefing
by Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno, Under Secretary-General
for Peacekeeping Operations.

I now give the floor to Mr. Guehenno.
