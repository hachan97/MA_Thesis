Mr. Laro (Nigeria): The attacks carried out by the
Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in Paris and Beirut,
the attacks by Boko Haram in Nigeria and today's
attacks by Al-Qaida-linked extremists in Bamako
serve to underscore the fact that terrorist groups are
a major threat to international peace and security.
Nigeria condemns those barbaric and cowardly attacks
in the strongest terms. There can be no justification for
terrorist attacks. The perpetrators must be relentlessly
purposed and brought to justice. We offer our deepest
condolences to the families, friends and loved ones of
those who have lost their lives in terrorist attacks and
wish the injured a quick recovery.

The situation calls for urgent action by the
international community to intensify the fight against
ISIS and other terrorist groups, including Boko Haram.
Resolution 2249 (2015), which the Counciljust adopted,
provides a framework for achieving that. All United
Nations States Members must now work together to
diligently implement the resolution.
