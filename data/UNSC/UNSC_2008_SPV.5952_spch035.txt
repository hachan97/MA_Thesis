Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Of course, this meeting of the Security
Council is not the best place for an exchange of
questions and answers between one Permanent
Representative and another, but there is an answer to
that question.

For a start, the Georgian authorities could state
that they intend, in the future, to abide by the
agreements that, I repeat, have maintained peace in that
conflict zone for 14 years. For a start, they could say
that they do intend to go back to the status quo ante as
it was before the military action began. For a start -
and I am not talking about more serious responsibilities
they bear - they could apologize very seriously for
the irresponsible and hasty actions taken by the
Georgian authorities, which have caused many
thousands of people to be killed and have caused the
capital of South Ossetia to be destroyed in the past
24 hours. That would be a start. We could then
continue the discussion, after that.
