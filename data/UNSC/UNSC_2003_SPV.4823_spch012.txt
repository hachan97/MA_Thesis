Ms. Menendez (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): Many
thanks to Mr. Annabi. Italy will speak shortly on behalf
of the European Union, so I shall confine myself to
making three points.

First, less than a month ago, we met here and
condemned the terrorist crime against Kosovo Serb
children. Regrettably, we note that ethnic and political
acts of violence have not ceased. We hope that the
perpetrators will be prosecuted and convicted. The
crimes committed cannot go unpunished. Kosovo's
future depends on the establishment of security.
Security is important for economic recovery, but it is
also essential for building a democratic and tolerant
society and for the process of the return of Kosovo's
citizens of non-Albanian origin. In that connection, we
hope that the open letter inviting displaced persons to
return to Kosovo will translate into a reality.

Secondly, we hope that Mr. Holkeri enjoys
success at the head of the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). He has
our full support, but obviously he must also have the
support and cooperation of the Pristina and Belgrade
authorities. We reiterate once again that we fully agree
with the policy promoted by UNMIK, in conformity
with the "standards before status" principle.

Thirdly and finally, we find the public statements
of the political leaders to be very disturbing. Positions
that are contrary to resolution 1244 (1999) cannot in
any way be allowed to be publicly and constantly
promoted. We condemn any attempt to create mono-
ethnic institutions, and we call for the dismantling of
any still-functioning parallel administrative structures.
We must actively encourage participation in the
Assembly and the Transfer Council by Kosovars of
non-Albanian origin.

Spain hopes to see the appeal made in
Thessaloniki for dialogue between Belgrade and
Pristina become a reality. The leaders of both parties
must stop placing preconditions on that dialogue and
must begin it as soon as possible.
