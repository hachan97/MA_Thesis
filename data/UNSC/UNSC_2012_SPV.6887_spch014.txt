Mr. Sun Xiaobo (China) (spoke in Chinese): Iwould
like to thank Prosecutor Bensouda for her briefing.

The problems in Darfur are complex and closely
intertwined, involving the political process, economic
development, humanitarian assistance and the pursuit
of justice, with the political process being the most
critical. Justice, important as it is, can be secured only
when durable peace and stability are achieved in Darfur
by political means. The top priority for the political
process is therefore for all sides to fully implement the
Doha Document for Peace in Darfur so that the parties
concerned can achieve a ceasefire and sign a peace
agreement based on the Document, and any action by
the international community, especially the Security
Council, should be aimed at achieving that goal.

China's position with regard to the involvement
of the International Criminal Court in Darfur remains
unchanged. We hope that the Council will value and
heed the views of regional organizations, including the
African Union and the League of Arab States.
