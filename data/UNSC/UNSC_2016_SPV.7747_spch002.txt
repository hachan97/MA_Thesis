Mr. Delattre (France) (spoke in French): The
Security Council has just adopted resolution 2301
(2016), which renews the mandate ofthe United Nations
Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in
the Central African Republic (MINUSCA). We welcome
the fact that, by adopting the resolution unanimously,
the Council has sent a united message of its support for
MINUSCA and for the Central African Republic.

The challenge in the negotiations that have come to
an end today was to adapt MINUSCA's mandate to the
new circumstances in the country. With the transition
having succeeded, stabilization must now succeed.
It is an ambitious undertaking - to be met first and
foremost by the country's new democratically elected
authorities. There are many programmes to be put in
place in order to address the root causes of the conflict
in the country. In that major taks, the authorities of the
Central African Republic can count on MINUSCA'S
support via an expanded mandate. As everyone can see,
we have tried to organize the mandate so as to provide
greater clarity, in large part to align it with the various
stages of implementation. As was the case last year,
we have encouraged the Secretary-General to provide
MINUSCA with the necessary resources in line with
the restructured mandate.

This is a big job, but with MINUSCA's nearly
13,000 uniformed personnel and significant civilian
component, the Mission has the capability to carry it out.
The Mission must establish its authority and credibility,
especially when it comes to the armed groups or anyone
who may attempt to derail the political process.

Finally, we riteraterate our confidence in, and
support for, Special Representative of the Secretary-
General Parfait Onanga-Anyanga.
