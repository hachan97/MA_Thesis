Mr. Fonseca (Brazil): Thank you, Mr. President, for
giving me the floor a second time. I cannot refrain from
thanking my colleagues for the words of praise addressed
to my predecessor, Ambassador Celso Amorim. It is with
pleasure that I will inform him of how meaningful his
contribution was to the work of the Council on this difficult
question.
