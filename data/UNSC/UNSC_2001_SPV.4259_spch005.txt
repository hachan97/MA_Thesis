The President: The next speaker on my list is the
representative of the United States, but before I give
the floor to Ambassador Holbrooke, let me first express
a sentiment that I am sure is shared by all those in this
Chamber.

We are all aware that this will be the last
appearance of Ambassador Holbrooke in his capacity
as Permanent Representative of the United States to the
United Nations. I believe it is fitting that his last
meeting with us be for a discussion of HIV/AIDS, a
matter on which Ambassador Holbrooke has made a
sterling contribution to raising international concerns
on this matter. This is only one of his many
contributions to the United Nations community. I am
sure I speak on behalf of everyone in this room when I
say that he will be missed in the United Nations when
he leaves. His stint in the United Nations caps a long
and distinguished history in the field of diplomacy,
including the historic achievement of peace in the
Balkans.

Ambassador Holbrooke is an old friend of
Singapore and of the South-East Asia region. My
Government will not forget his valuable contribution to
enhancing stability in South-East Asia at a critical
juncture of our history, when he was Assistant
Secretary for Asia and the Pacific in the Carter
Administration. We are glad that he kept in touch with
us during these years, and we hope that he will
continue to do so when he moves to a new career.

Those who know you, Ambassador Holbrooke,
have no doubt that you will continue to play a very
important role in political and public affairs in the
United States of America. We wish you all the best,
and we have no doubt that you will do well in your new
career.

I would like to call on the members of the
Council to join me in a round of applause before I give
the floor to Ambassador Holbrooke.
