The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Afghanistan in which he requests
to be invited to participate in the consideration of the
item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the
usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the
Council, to invite that representative to participate in
the consideration of the item, without the right to vote,
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Farhddi
(Afghanistan) took a seat at the Council table.

The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

At this meeting the Council will hear a briefing
by His Excellency Mr. Kenzo Oshima, Permanent
Representative of Japan and Head of the Security
Council mission to Afghanistan.

I would like to welcome the return of the
members of the Council and the Secretariat who took
part in the mission to Afghanistan.

I now give the floor to Mr. Oshima, Head of the
Security Council mission to Afghanistan.
