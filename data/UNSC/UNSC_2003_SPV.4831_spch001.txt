The President: The Security Council will now
proceed to the consideration of its annual report to the
General Assembly, the draft of which has been
prepared by the Secretariat.

Members of the Council have before them the
draft report of the Security Council to the General
Assembly for the period from 1 August 2002 to 31 July
2003, as circulated by the Assistant Secretary-General
for Political Affairs on 8 August 2003, and a
corrigendum thereto.

I should like to express appreciation to the
Secretariat for the work it has undertaken in preparing
this factual report and in a timely manner.

I now call on the Director of the Security Council
Affairs Division to make an explanatory statement.
