The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Benin and Thailand, in which they
request to be invited to participate in the consideration
of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity
with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of
the Council, to invite those representatives to
participate in the consideration of the item, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Zinsou
(Benin) and Mr. Pramudwinai (Thailand) took the
seats reservedfor them at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The President: I wish to remind all speakers, as I
indicated this morning, to limit their statements to no
more than five minutes in order to enable the Council
to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with
lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate the
texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version
when speaking in the Chamber.

I now call on the representative of Angola.
