Mr. Garcia Moritan (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): I would like to thank the Minister of Justice
of Burundi, Mr. Kiganahe, for his clear presentation
today and for his comments on how to implement the
recommendations in the report of the assessment
mission. We also thank Mr. Zacklin for introducing the
report submitted to us by the Secretary-General.

In that regard, I would like to highlight the
importance that my own country attaches to judging
crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes so
that the perpetrators of these aberrant crimes will not
go unpunished anywhere in the world. It is for this
reason that my Government supports any initiative
which is aimed at bringing those guilty of these gravest
of crimes to justice. The Argentine delegation also
supports the initiative under which the Secretary-
General would begin negotiations with the Burundian
parties in order to implement the recommendations
contained in the report of the assessment mission.
