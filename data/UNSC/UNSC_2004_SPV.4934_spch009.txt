Mr. Mufioz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): Chile
regrets the fact that it was not possible to reach
unanimous agreement on this draft resolution. Chile
voted in favour of the draft resolution because we feel
that extrajudicial execution is an act of violence and
therefore needs to be condemned. Although any State
has the right to protect its citizens from terrorist
attacks, it must do so in accordance with the norms of
international law. Moreover, Chile is of the view that
operative paragraph 2 of the draft resolution contains a
condemnation of suicide attacks against civilians only.
We also stress the urgent need for all parties to meet
their obligations under the road map, as called for
under Security Council resolution 1515 (2003).
