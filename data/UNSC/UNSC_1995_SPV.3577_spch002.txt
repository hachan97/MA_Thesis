Mr. Merimee (France) (interpretation from French):
I had not expected such words of praise, Mr. President, and
I thank you for them. Since the work of the Security
Council is a collective endeavour, everything you have said
would not have been possible without the assistance that I
have received from all the members of the Council. Once
again, I thank everyone from the bottom of my heart.
