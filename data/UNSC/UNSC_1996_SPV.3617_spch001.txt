The President: It is with great sadness that we have
received this morning the news of the passing away of
former President Francois Mitterrand.

President Mitterrand played a pivotal role in the
history of his country, indeed of the world. His political life
spanned five decades, during which he played an active and
influential role as a Cabinet minister, as a political leader
and as a statesman. In recent years, President Mitterrand
was instrumental in the process of the unification of
Europe. President Mitterrand was also known for his
determination and his courage, which he demonstrated until
his last days.

President Mitterrand was a friend of the United
Nations and a strong defender of its principles and
objectives.

Today, the world mourns the passing away of this
great man. On behalf of all members of the Council, I
should like to ask the Permanent Representative of France,
His Excellency Ambassador Alain Dej ammet, to convey our
deepest sympathy to the family of President Mitterrand and
to the Government and the people of France.

I now invite the members of the Council to rise and
observe a minute of silence in tribute to the memory of
President Mitterrand.

The members of the Council observed a minute of
silence.
