Mr. Oyarzun Marchesi (Spain) (spoke in Spanish):
Spain voted in favour of today's resolution 2285 (2016).
We heartily commend the efforts of the United States
as facilitator and other members of the Security
Council for their work. We are well aware of the
difficulties those negotiations presented. Spain would
have preferred that this year we could have once again
adopted the resolution unanimously in a demonstration
of the Council's unity. Unfortunately, that has not been
the case.

Among other things, the role of the United Nations
Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara
(MINURSO) is crucial to maintaining peace and
security in a strategic region. We believe that the text
of the resolution succeeded in achieving a balance
between the annual renewal, which in our view provides
necessary institutional stability, and appropriate follow-
up on the part of the Security Council to ensure that
MINURSO is restored to full functionality and is in a
condition to comply fully with its mandate, as called
for in the resolution we have just adopted. It is time to
overcome this crisis. We encourage Morocco and the
Secretariat to intensify their contact and efforts.
Beyond today's mandate renewal, Spain believes
that the international community must focus its efforts
on helping the parties to reach ajust, lasting and mutually
acceptable political solution that calls for the free self-
determination of the people of Western Sahara within a
framework of provisions in line with the purposes and
principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
