Mr. Tarar (Pakistan): We welcome the adoption of
resolution 2075 (2012). Pakistan supports the peaceful
resolution of all outstanding issues between the Sudan
and South Sudan. We commend the decisions taken
by the political leadership of both countries, resulting
in the signing of several agreements on a number of
contentious issues between the two sides. We hope that
the two sides will continue to demonstrate this political
will towards resolving the remaining outstanding
issues.
Pakistan has always consistently supported and
will continue to support the efforts of the African Union
(AU), which is playing a key role in resolving issues
pertaining to the African continent. We commend the
efforts of the African Union High-level Implementation
Panel for the Sudan and South Sudan, under the
leadership of President Mbeki. The Security Council
should continue to play a constructive and balanced
role in addressing the situation between the Sudan
and South Sudan, and should stand united behind the
African Union with the aim of achieving peace and
stability in the region. It is important that the Council
remain consistent in its support for the decisions of the
African Union with regard to the situation between
the Sudan and South Sudan. A selective response to
the African Union's decisions could undermine the
peaceful resolution of the outstanding issues between
the two countries.

In our view, the resolution should also have referred
to the AU Peace and Security Council communique of
3 August, which remains an essential and integral part
of the series of decisions made by the African Union
on the situation between the Sudan and South Sudan.
Pakistan commends and fully supports the important
role being played by the United Nations Interim
Security Force for Abyei in the maintenance of peace
and stability in Abyei, in line with its mandate. We will
also continue to support all efforts aimed at achieving a
lasting and viable peace between the Sudan and South
Sudan.
