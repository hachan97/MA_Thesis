The President (spoke in Arabic): There are no
more names inscribed on the list of speakers.

Before adjourning the meeting, as this is the last
scheduled meeting of the Security Council for the
month of August, I would like to express the sincere
appreciation of the delegation of Egypt to the members
of the Council, especially to my colleagues, the
permanent representatives, to their respective staff and
to the Secretariat of the Council, for all the support they
have given to us.

I would also like to thank my colleagues in the
Egyptian delegation for their great efforts during our
presidency of the Council for this month, without which
we would not have been able to achieve as much as we
did. Indeed it has been a busy month and one in which
we rallied to consensus on several important issues
within our purview, most importantly the renewal of
the mandate of the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (resolution 2373 (2017)) and our presidential
statement of yesterday regarding the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (S/PRST/2017/16).

We also held a number of discussions that
have contributed to our continued efforts aimed at
improving the work of the Council with a view to
meeting any challenges to international peace and
security, in particular our efforts to counter terrorism,
develop sanctions regimes and ensure the contribution
of peacekeeping operations to sustaining peace. We
could not have done any of this alone and without the
hard work, support and positive contributions of every
delegation and the representatives of the Secretariat
as well as all relevant Conference Services officers,
interpreters and translators. I would therefore like to
sincerely thank all of them.

As we end our presidency, I know I speak on behalf
of the Council when I wish the delegation of Ethiopia
good luck in the month of September.

The meeting rose at 5.25 pm.
