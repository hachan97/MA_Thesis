The President: Before giving the floor to the
next speaker, let me review with the Council the
situation regarding the time and the number of speakers
we have. We still have three other Council members to
hear - Singapore, Colombia and Bangladesh. To help
the situation, I can forgo my national statement. But we
will still need at least 10 minutes for Singapore and
Colombia, five each. We also have four speakers under
rule 37. My initial contacts with them told me that the
four of them will need about 35 minutes. Thereafter we
will hear from Ambassador Menkerios, whom I believe
should be given at least 10 minutes to respond to many
of the questions raised. That makes a total of 55
minutes. It is my intention to close this meeting at 1.15
pm. If we need to go beyond that, we will have to
come back at 3 pm.
