I have the honour to refer to the draft resolution contained in document S/2020/1054, submitted by the Russian Federation, in connection with the agenda item "Women and peace and security". In accordance with the voting procedure agreed by the members and set out in the letter by the President of the Security Council dated 27 March 2020 (S/2020/253) - a procedure agreed in light of the extraordinary circumstances caused by the coronavirus disease pandemic - the draft resolution received five votes in favour (China, Indonesia, the Russian Federation, South Africa and Viet Nam), none against and 10 abstentions (Belgium, the Dominican Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, the Niger, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Tunisia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America). The draft resolution has not been adopted, having failed to obtain the required number of votes. Pursuant to that procedure, I enclose herewith copies of the related documents. My letter dated 29 October 2020, addressed to the Permanent Representatives of Security Council members, putting to the vote the draft resolution contained in document S/2020/1054 (annex | and enclosure); Reply letters received from Security Council members indicating their national positions on the draft resolution (annexes 2 to 16); Statements subsequently submitted by Security Council members providing explanations of their votes (annexes 17 to 28). This letter and its enclosures will be issued as a document of the Security Council.
