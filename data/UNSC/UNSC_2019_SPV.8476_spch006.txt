Mr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
is paying close attention to the situation in Venezuela
and supports the Venezuelan Government in its efforts
to safeguard its national sovereignty, independence and

stability. Venezuelan affairs should be decided by the
Venezuelan people independently. When it comes to the
Venezuela issue, China's starting point in the Security
Council's is to uphold the spirit of the Charter of the
United Nations and the basic principles governing
international relations, promote a peaceful settlement
of the Venezuela issue and maintain long-term peace,
stability and development in Latin America.

China opposes external forces interfering in
Venezuela's internal affairs and opposes military
intervention in Venezuela. It is regrettable that the
draft resolution before us (S/2019/186) was seriously
inconsistent with China's principles and position
as previously stated. Therefore, China had to vote
against it.

China calls upon the Venezuelan Government and
opposition parties to seek a political solution through
dialogue and consultation within the constitutional
and legal framework. We hope that the international
community will take actions that are truly conducive to
the stability and economic development of Venezuela
and the improvement of the livelihoods of people
in the country. Under the premise of respecting
the sovereignty of Venezuela, we should provide
constructive assistance to the country to promote a
smooth resolution of relevant issues as far as possible.

Any actions taken by the Security Council on
Venezuela should be in line with those principles.
