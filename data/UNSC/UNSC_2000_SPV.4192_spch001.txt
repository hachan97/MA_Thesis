The President: The Security Council will now
proceed to the consideration of its annual report to the
General Assembly, the draft of which has been
prepared by the Secretariat. Members of the Council
have before them the draft report of the Security
Council to the General Assembly for the period from
16 June 1999 to 15 June 2000, as circulated by the
Officer-in-Charge of the Department of Political
Affairs on 21 August 2000, and a corrigendum thereto.

I should like to express appreciation to the
Secretariat for the work it has undertaken in preparing
this factual report.

I shall now call on the Assistant Secretary-
General for Political Affairs to make an explanatory
statement.
