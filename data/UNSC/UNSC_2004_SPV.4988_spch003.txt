Mr. Trautwein (Germany): Germany welcomes
the United Nations commitment to supporting the
implementation of a future north-south peace
agreement for the Sudan, which is highlighted in the
resolution the Council has just adopted unanimously.
This agreement, when truly implemented, will offer the
possibility of finding an end to this long-lasting
conflict, which has cost so many lives.

While there has been significant progress in the
comprehensive Sudanese peace process, which the text
of this resolution explicitly recognizes, a lasting
peaceful settlement for the whole of the Sudan will be
possible only when all the conflicts in the countries
have been resolved. That includes an end to the
sweeping and widespread human rights violations in
the conflict regions in the Sudan.

The Secretary-General's report (S/2004/453),
which the Council expressly welcomed today with the
resolution at hand, clearly refers to that fact. In that
context, Germany expresses its support for the plan of
action for the protection of human rights in Darfur
presented by the Acting High Commissioner for
Human Rights. We believed that it was indispensable
that this overall context of the conflict should also be
appropriately reflected in the resolution, and we
therefore welcome the reference in the text of the
resolution to the presidential statement of 25 May
(S/PRST/2004/18), which directly addresses the
conflicts in Darfur and in the western Upper Nile. We
call upon the parties to the conflict to meet their
obligations arising from the N'Djamena peace
agreement.
