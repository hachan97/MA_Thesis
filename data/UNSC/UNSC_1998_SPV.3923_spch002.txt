Mrs. Bali (Director of the Security Council Affairs Division): The draft annual report of the Security Council
for the period 16 June 1997 to 15 June 1998, to be
submitted to the General Assembly of the United Nations
in pursuance of Article 24, paragraph 3, and Article 15,
paragraph 1, of the United Nations Charter, has been
prepared by the Secretariat in line with the revised format
agreed upon by the Security Council in 1974 and further
revised in 1985, 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1997.

The format of the draft report before the Council
provides a guide to the activities of the Council in a
concise manner. It corresponds to the Council's decisions
on the format. This is the first report prepared in
accordance with the measures set out in the note by the
President of 12 June 1997, in S/1997/451, which were
aimed at enhancing the analytical nature of the report and
accommodating the views expressed on the previous
format. It should be noted that the addendum to the report
contains monthly assessments prepared by former
Presidents of the Security Council under their own
responsibility, for the month during which they presided,
and following consultations with members of the Council.

The draft report was circulated by the Under-
Secretary-General for Political Affairs on 24 August 1998
to the current members of the Security Council and also
to the members whose terms of office expired on 31
December 1997, that is, Chile, Egypt, Guinea-Bissau,
Poland and the Republic of Korea, for review and
comments, if any. Corrigenda containing changes
proposed by Council members and by the Secretariat have
also been circulated to Council members.
