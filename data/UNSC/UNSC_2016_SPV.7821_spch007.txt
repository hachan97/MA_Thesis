Mr. Safronkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation voted in favour
of today's resolution 2321 (2016), which sanctions
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for
conducting a fifth nuclear test. We should note that
while Pyongyang's behaviour ignored the legitimate
requests of the international community and therefore
required us to adopt tough measures in the form of a
standard Council resolution, today's resolution is in no
way designed to close off the possibility of reviving the
process of negotiations on the nuclear problem on the
Korean peninsula and seeking a political solution to the
outstanding issues in Asia's North-East.

We want to particularly emphasize that the new
resolution should absolutely not be used to stifle
North Korea's economy or to worsen the humanitarian
situation and the people's circumstances. The situation
on the Korean peninsula should not be used as a
pretext for increasing the foreign military presence
in the region. We firmly condemn any buildup of
offensive weapons near the borders that the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea shares with neighbours,
including the deployment of Terminal High Altitude
Area Defense anti-ballistic missile systems. A country
cannot possibly achieve lasting long-term security
if it tries to build it at the expense of the security of
other States. We urge all sides to show restraint, avoid
provocative rhetoric and aggravations of the situation
and act speedily in seeking a way out of the crisis. On
that basis, the Russian Federation is ready to cooperate
on the issue with its regional and international partners.
