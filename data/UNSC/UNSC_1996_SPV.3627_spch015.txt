The President: It is my understanding that the
Security Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the
draft resolution (S/1996/69) before it. If I hear no objection,
I shall now put the draft resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:

Botswana, Chile, China, Egypt, France, Germany,
Guinea-Bissau, Honduras, Indonesia, Italy, Poland,
Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America

The President: There were 15 votes in favour. The
draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1044 (1996).

I shall now call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements following the voting.
