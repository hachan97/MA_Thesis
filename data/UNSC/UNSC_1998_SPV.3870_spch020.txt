Mr. Fedotov (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian): The Russian Federation notes with satisfaction
that the situation in Rwanda has stabilized to some extent.
The Rwandan people, after suffering the horrors of
genocide, are slowly but surely returning to normal life.
We also attach great importance to the swift, final
normalization of the situation in the Great Lakes region
as a whole, without which it would be difficult to achieve
a lasting stabilization of the situation in Rwanda and in
the surrounding region.

An important element in strengthening security in
the region is the establishment of a lasting barrier to the
illegal flow of arms that could fuel a new spiral of
bloodshed. We continue to be concerned by information
about arms flows to the forces of the former Rwandan
regime, in Violation of the embargo imposed by the
Security Council in resolutions 918 (1994) and 1011
(1995). Given the continued seriousness of this problem,
we support the reactivation of the work of the
International Commission of Inquiry, which, we believe,
is essential to deter political and ethnic extremism in the
region.

The Russian delegation will vote in favour of the
draft resolution.
