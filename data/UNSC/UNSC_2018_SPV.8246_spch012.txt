Mr. Inchauste Jordan (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): The delegation of Bolivia
voted in favour of resolution 2414 (2018) given the need
to relaunch the political process and in order to express
its full support to the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-
General for Western Sahara, Mr. Horst Kohler, and
to the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in
Western Sahara in the discharge of their respective
missions and mandates.

We wish also to reiterate our full support for
the Secretary-General's proposal to revitalize the
negotiation process by infusing it with a fresh dynamic
and spirit, in order to achieve, through a negotiated
process, ajust, lasting and mutually acceptable political
solution leading to the self-determination of the people
of Western Sahara, in keeping with the purposes and
principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the
relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the
Security Council.

Despite all of this, my delegation expresses its
concern at the fact that none of the proposals made
during the negotiations were taken into account. Those
proposals were aimed at making the text more balanced,
on the basis of the most recent report of the Secretary-
General on the situation concerning Western Sahara
(S/2018/277), with a view to crafting a resolution that
everyone could fully support.

Likewise, we are concerned about the unexpected
change made to the text with regard to the duration of
the mandate. That change was not discussed at any time
during the negotiation process, nor was the delegation
of Bolivia consulted thereon.

On the basis of the principle of transparency,
Bolivia expresses its concern at the arbitrary nature
of the penholder's actions in this instance, as this sets
a bad precedent in terms of the working practices of
this body and could, in the long run, become a very
negative custom.
