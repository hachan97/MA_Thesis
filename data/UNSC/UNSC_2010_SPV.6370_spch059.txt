The President (spoke in Russian): I thank
Lieutenant General Obiakor. And, once again, we
should like to express our gratitude to him for his
productive efforts in the service of the United Nations.

Before adjourning the meeting, I should like, on
behalf of the Security Council, to thank all the force
commanders who participated in today's meeting for
the frank assessments they provided and the ideas they
put forward. There is no doubt that everything we
heard today will be extremely useful to the Council in
its further practical work in this crucial area of
peacekeeping operations.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 2.05 p.m.
