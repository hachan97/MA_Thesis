Ms. Murmokaite (Lithuania): I wish to thank
you, Madam President, for convening this meeting. I
also wish to thank Assistant Secretary-General Oscar
Fernandez-Taranco for his briefing.

Lithuania is deeply concerned about the sharp
deterioration of the situation in eastern Ukraine.
External forces and local provocateurs continue to
fuel separatism and hatred, destabilizing the situation
in eastern Ukraine on the eve of the 25 May elections.
The scenario is dangerously familiar. Where there was
no unrest, unrest and chaos are being created by pro-
Russian militias, again anonymous and without insignia,
and again carrying modern models of assault weapons
as seen in Crimea. Again, considerable Russian troops
are massed on Ukraine's borders. Again, the external
anti-Ukranian and anti-Western propaganda machine is
in full swing, inciting suspicion, mistrust and hatred
waiting to explode. Ukraine's traitor Yanukovich, who
abandoned his country and fled, opening the floodgates
to Crimea's annexation, is being pushed again into
the daylight to clear the way for Ukraine's further
dismemberment.

Groups of provocateurs in the hundreds, supported
by pro-Russian militias, are attacking buildings of
Ukraine's State institutions and declaring independence
from Ukraine, as well as announcing plans for new
referendums on joining Russia, in spite of the fact that
recent opinion polls clearly show that the predominant
majority of people in the region see their future
inextricably linked to Ukraine. In fact, about 65 per
cent of the region's residents, according to opinion
polls, have expressed their desire to remain part of
Ukraine, while only 18.2 per cent want to join Russia.

Tragically, bloodshed is happening where there was
no bloodshed before pro-Russian militants started their
creeping secessionist provocations. It is as clear as day
that, in spite of the reassurances we heard from Moscow
a few weeks ago, military aggression against Ukraine
and its sovereignty, independence, and territorial
integrity has not stopped with Crimea. My Government
strongly condemns the actions of the separatist groups
and their sponsors in the Donetsk region, as well as in
the regions of Luhansk and Kharkiv.

Lithuania supports the efforts of the Government
of Ukraine to resolve this complex and unpredictable
situation in a peaceful way. Ukraine's Government has
reached out repeatedly to the separatists. In the most
difficult of political and economic circumstances,
Ukraine's acting President Turchinov has decided
to prepare a law on decentralization, granting
more powers to the regions. Acting Prime Minister
Yatseniuk has clearly stated that the Government
must respond to people's desire to have more regional
authority. That decision is an important step forward,
showing the flexibility and readiness of legitimate
Ukrainian authorities to heed its population and engage
constructively.
Prime Minister Yatseniuk also reassured the
Russian-speaking population regarding the use of the
Russian language. Furthermore, amnesty was offered
to all militants who laid down arms and returned to
seeking a peaceful solution to existing issues.

It is obvious that the Ukrainian Government
is doing everything possible, under such dramatic
circumstances, to respond to the legitimate needs
and concerns of the population, to curb corruption
and impunity, which had reigned under Yanukovich,
to re-establish law and order and the authority of the
State and to address the problems the Government
inherited from years of neglect and mismanagement.
We fully support those efforts and once again stress
the extraordinary restraint and patience with which
Ukraine's Government has continued to respond to the
unending provocations and efforts to dismember the
State by armed pro-Russian militants and separatists.

At the same time, when the existence of a State
is put in danger, we understand and support the right
of Ukraine to defend itself in the face of external
aggression and to tackle militant separatism and
continuous provocations in order to protect the State
and its population from a further escalation of violence.

The international community and members of the
Council should not be fooled by the pronouncements
of the likes of Yanukovich and his corrupt cronies. The
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Ukraine are being threatened, and that threat is a threat
to the security and stability of the whole region and
Europe, with serious international repercussions.

We urge the Russian Federation to call back its
troops from the Ukrainian border, to stop supporting
separatist groups and to cease all other actions aimed
at destabilizing Ukraine. The meeting among the
United States, Russia, Ukraine and the European Union
foreseen for 17 April in Geneva wold offer a viable
chance for dialogue and diplomacy. We call on Russia
not to waste that opportunity.
