The President (spoke in Chinese): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of China.

China believes that political dialogue is the only
way out of the situation in Burundi. China welcomes
the positive efforts by the Government of Burundi
to safeguard the stability of the country and promote
national reconciliation, and encourages all parties in
Burundi to actively participate in dialogue and resolve
their differences peacefully.

China has always supported Africa in resolving
African issues in an African way and appreciates the
constructive mediation efforts on this issue by the East
African Community and other relevant regional and
subregional organizations. The unanimous adoption of
resolution 2279 (2016) by the Security Council signifies
the strong support of the international community
for the East African Community-led mediation and
demonstrates the firm support of the international
community for a political settlement for this issue. China
hopes that by implementing resolution 2279 (2016)
the relevant parties will fully respect the sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity of Burundi,
strengthen their consultation with the Government of
Burundi andjointly agree on a solution so as to achieve
peace, security, stability and development in Burundi
at an early date.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Burundi.
