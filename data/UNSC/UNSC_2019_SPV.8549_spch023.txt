Mr. Lacroix: I will be very brief. The representative
of the Russian Federation asked a question regarding
technical issues that could have an impact on the
drawdown process. So far, UNAMID has been able to
carry out the drawdown as decided by resolution 2429
(2018). A number of technical issues must be resolved,
of course, but we are familiar with them and they have
not prevented the drawdown process from taking place.
At the same time, we have had to deal with logistical
constraints and sometimes lengthy procedures,
but those are things that we have been handling in
cooperation with our Sudanese interlocutors.

Based on that, the time frame within which we are
usually able to redeploy our units out of the country
is between six and nine months, more or less. That
includes moving the contingents out of their camps
and regrouping their equipment to El Fasher before
eventually bringing them to Port Sudan and making sure
that the necessary clearances are forthcoming. As I said,
none of that has ever been completely easy, but we have
been able to handle it so far. Of course, the interaction
with the Sudanese authorities is very important in that
context, and the fluid situation in Khartoum has had
some impact on that, as I mentioned in my statement.
Whatever potential impact that fluid situation may have
on the overall security situation, not just in Darfur but
in the rest of the country, may also potentially have an
impact on the proceedings that I have briefly described.
That is essentially what I would like to say in response
to my Russian colleague's question.
