The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Iraq, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

On behalf of the Council, I extend a warm
welcome to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq,
Mr. Hoshyar Zebari.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Zebari
(Iraq) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

I wish to draw the attention of members to
document S/2005/337, which contains the text of a
letter dated 24 May 2005 from the Permanent
Representative of Iraq addressed to the President of the
Security Council.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mrs. Anne Patterson, representative of the
United States, on behalf of the multinational force.
