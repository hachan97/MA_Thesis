Mr. Tumysh (Kazakhstan): Kazakhstan has
always opposed the use of chemical weapons, as well
as any other kind of weapon of mass destruction. In
that regard, we consider the facts pertaining to the use
of chemical weapons in Syria to indicate a flagrant
and inhuman act that cannot be justified. Given the
extreme importance of the complete and immediate
cessation of the use of chemical weapons and bringing
the perpetrators to justice, we stand for the unanimous
adoption of measures that would truly lead us to the
cessation of the use of chemical weapons in Syria and
the ultimate goal of ending the bloodshed. Today's
meeting, however, shows the inability of the Security
Council to adopt a coherent and mutually acceptable
solution on this important issue, which will prolong the
suffering of the Syrian people and is not conducive to
resolving the crisis in that long-suffering nation.

The issue requires a coherent, balanced and
meaningful approach. We believe that we cannot place
responsibility on only one side of the conflict for the
use of chemical weapons and that it is fundamentally
important to make concrete punitive decisions only on
the basis of strong, clear and irrefutable evidence with
clear facts and complete conclusions. It is therefore
necessary to continue the work of the Organization for
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations
Joint Investigative Mechanism, and we fully support it.

Finally, given the aforementioned and the fact
that the lack of consensus on the draft resolution
exacerbates the situation in Syria and is not conducive
to strengthening the Security Council's efforts in the
pursuit of peace and security, my delegation abstained
in the voting.
