Mr. Adamu (Nigeria): I would like to thank
the briefers - Deputy Secretary-General Eliasson,
Mr. Simonovie, Mr. John Ging and Ambassador
Apakan - for their informative remarks.

We have been following the developments in
Ukraine very closely and are concerned by the tenuous
peace prevailing in the country. In our View, the
package of measures for the implementation of the
Minsk agreements of February 2015 provide a concise
and clear road map for settling the situation in Ukraine.
That is why we urge the parties to abide by their
obligations under the agreements in order to achieve
the objectives of the ceasefire.

Reports of indiscriminate shelling of populated
areas are a matter of concern to us. That endangers
the lives of civilians and exacerbates the humanitarian
situation. We therefore urge the parties to take care
not to expose civilians to unacceptable risks. Nigeria
is also concerned about the humanitarian situation
in eastern Ukraine. According to the Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, many civilians
in Donetsk and Luhansk continue to endure limited
or no access to humanitarian assistance. We urge the
authorities to remove the bureaucratic impediments to
the work of humanitarian actors in order to facilitate
the delivery of much-needed assistance. On the same
subject, we applaud the efforts of the United Nations
and other humanitarian actors to address the challenges
in eastern Ukraine. We urge them to remain engaged in
the situation until it stabilizes, and call on the authorities
to take steps to ensure the establishment of an effective
system for the adequate coordination of relief efforts in
the region.
