Mr. Ould-Abdallah (spoke in French): I should
like to make only four points.

I think it is extremely important to insist once
again that the unemployment among young people in
West Africa poses a great threat to the stability of
countries, as a number of speakers have said. It is also
a threat to the bilateral relations between the region
and its closest neighbours, particularly in Western
Europe. In all of these countries, the immigration of
young people is also an issue.

Secondly, the Security Council should discuss
how to find the best way to support the presidential and
parliamentary elections to be held in 2007 in Benin,
Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone.
It is a period of tension - tension that must be
prevented.

Thirdly, there are democratic countries such as
yours, Mr. President - stable countries such as Mali
and Niger, which at the same time are fragile countries
exposed to drought and other unpredictable events.
They respect the law and the rights of their citizens.
How can we help them to strengthen their capacities?

My last point is that African public opinion is
better informed. Today, I circulated a little radio that
cost $1, bought in Africa - a radio that all Africans
can buy. My generation could not buy one for less than
$50. Therefore, Security Council debates are followed
closely by all African countries in crisis, thanks to
FM. radio, so we must be increasingly mindful of
public opinion in Africa, particularly West Africa. It is
aware of the messages that the Council can send it.
