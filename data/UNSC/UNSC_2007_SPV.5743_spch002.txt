Mr. Verbeke: This is my third 90-day report to
the Security Council, which I am delivering in
accordance with paragraph 18 of resolution 1737
(2006). The report covers the period 22 June to
19 September 2007.

During that period, the Committee established
pursuant to resolution 1737 (2006) held seven informal
consultations to address various matters, mostly
relating to paragraphs 15, 18 and 19 of resolution 1737
(2006) and paragraph 8 of resolution 1747 (2007). The
Committee also carried out much of its work outside
the meeting room, using the silence procedure.

As members will recall, paragraph 15 of
resolution 1737 (2006) concerns notifications by
relevant States to the Committee of the intention to
make or receive payments, or to authorize the
unfreezing of funds, in connection with contracts
entered into prior to the listing of persons and entities
in the annexes to resolutions 1737 (2006) and 1747
(2007), subject to the assets freeze. During the
reporting period, in order to ensure consistency in its
2

work, the Committee agreed on the text of a model
letter that would henceforth be sent out to the notifying
State in acknowledgement of its notification. Where
appropriate, the letter would also invite the notifying
State to consider providing additional information
regarding individual transactions, in accordance with
the Committee's guidelines. The Committee received
12 notifications. In addition, the Committee responded
to a written query from a Member State on the
application and interpretation of paragraph 15 of
resolution 1737 (2006).

Since I mention the assets freeze, let me also
inform members that, pursuant to subparagraph 13 (b)
of resolution 1737 (2006), the Committee granted one
exemption to that measure to cover extraordinary
expenses, as determined by the relevant State, of a
listed entity.

Paragraph 18 (b) of resolution 1737 (2006) tasks
the Committee with seeking from the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) secretariat information
regarding the actions taken by the IAEA to implement
effectively the measures imposed by paragraph 16 of
the same resolution, which defines the scope of the
technical cooperation provided by the IAEA to Iran,
and whatever further information it might consider in
that regard. Members will recall that the Committee
initially sought such information in February of this
year, following which the IAEA transmitted a report on
8 March. On 7 August, given that more than four
months had elapsed since the receipt of the first report,
the Committee invited the IAEA to provide an update
and, as it deemed appropriate, any additional details
with respect to the IAEA's technical assistance to Iran
and paragraph 5 of its report transmitted on 8 March.

By a letter dated 22 August, the IAEA informed
the Committee that no projects had been added to its
technical cooperation programme with Iran since the
issuance of its first report, and provided an update on
technical cooperation and technical assistance
activities since 8 March. Six requests for technical
cooperation were considered to be covered and had
proceeded; five others had not. Twenty-four requests
for participation in technical assistance activities had
been deemed in conformity with resolution 1737
(2006), whereas a further three requests were not.

As members will recall, in paragraph 19 of
resolution 1737 (2006) the Security Council decided
that all States would report to the Committee within
07-50999
60 days of the adoption of the resolution on the steps
they had taken with a View to implementing effectively
paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 17 of the
resolution. In paragraph 8 of resolution 1747 (2007),
the Council called upon all States to report to the
Committee within 60 days of the adoption of the
resolution on the steps they had taken with a view to
implementing effectively paragraphs 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of
that resolution. On 19 July, the Committee agreed to
send a note verbale - the third such note - to States
that had not yet reported under either resolution,
encouraging them to submit reports and reminding
them that the deadlines set by both resolutions had
passed. The Committee also informed those States that
submission by other States that had already been
received and published could be found on the
Committee's website.

Since I last briefed the Council, the Committee
has received three additional reports under resolution
1737 (2006), 11 additional reports under resolution
1747 (2007), and five additional combined reports
under both resolutions. That brings the total number of
reports under resolution 1737 (2006) to 81, and the
total number of reports under resolution 1747 (2007) to
67. As before, I would like to inform the Council that,
of the 19 additional reports received within the past
three months, 15 States reported that they already had
legislation in place that covered the relevant
paragraphs of the resolutions. A further four States
reported on the steps they had taken or would be taking
to put the necessary legal framework in place. Finally,
all States that submitted reports assured the Committee
of their commitment to implementing resolutions 1737
(2006) and 1747 (2007) and to meeting their
obligations as outlined therein.

That concludes my summary of the Committee's
activities. With respect to working methods, members
may be aware that, in the interests of transparency, the
date, time and venue of both formal meetings and
informal consultations of the Committee are announced
in the daily Journal of the United Nations, and a web
link to the Journal is available on the Committee's web
page. That new practice is in conformity with the
presidential note of 19 July 2006, as well as the
recommendations of the Council's informal working
group on general issues of sanctions.

Finally, let me assure the Security Council that
the Committee will continue to discharge its mandate
to the best of its ability.
