The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them document
S/2017/70, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/20l7/20, which contains the report of
the Secretary-General on the United Nations operation
in Cyprus.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.

of the Council has met with the representatives of the
parties, who have presented their positions vis-a-vis
the item on the Council's agenda. On the basis of those
meetings, with the consent of the members of the
Council, the presidency has drawn the conclusion that
the Council can proceed to take a decision on the draft
resolution before it.

IfI hear no objection, I shall put the draft resolution
to the vote now.
