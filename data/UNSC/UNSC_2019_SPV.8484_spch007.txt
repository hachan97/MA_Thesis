Mr. Malwal (South Sudan): I would like to reiterate
my delegation's support to your presidency, Madam
President, and its readiness to cooperate with you. The
Government of South Sudan welcomes the Secretary-
General's report (S/2019/l9l) and takes note of the
renewed mandate of the United Nations Mission in the
Republic of South Sudan. With regard to the adoption
of resolution 2459 (2019), we would like to thank all
the Council members who worked hard on the draft

text. We also want to thank all the troop-contributing
countries for their services and sacrifice for the people

of South Sudan.

We continue to urge the Council to join hands with

the leaders of South Sudan, the Intergovernmental

Authority on Development and the African Union in

implementing the signed Revitalized Agreement on

the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South

Sudan. The Council's support and encouragement to

all the political leaders and the people of South Sudan

is absolutely critical to the Agreement's timely and

smooth implementation. There is no greater political

commitment than that.

In conclusion, I would like to express my

delegation's appreciation to Japan in particular and to

all who have given positive assistance to South Sudan

in the implementation of the Revitalized Agreement.

That is the spirit we would like to see from the Council

and the larger international community.

The meeting rose at 3.25 p.m.
