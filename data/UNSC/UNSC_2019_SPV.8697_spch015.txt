Ms. Wronecka (Poland): Our decision to vote
against draft resolution S/2019/962 was based on a
strong feeling that the unconstructive methods of
proceeding with such an important document are not
in line with the highest standards that the Security
Council should embody. The draft submitted by the
representative of Russia did not meet the conditions
necessary to provide lifesaving humanitarian assistance
to the people of Syria.
