Mr. Li Kexin (China) (spoke in Chinese): First of
all, China wishes to thank the Secretary-General for his
report as well as the Special Representative,
Mr. Zannier, for his briefing.

We listened carefully to the statement by His
Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremic', the Minister for Foreign
Affairs of Serbia, as well as the statement by
Mr. Skender Hyseni.

China's position on the question of Kosovo has
been consistent. We maintain that all parties concerned
should properly resolve the question of Kosovo on the
basis of the purposes and principals of the United
Nations Charter and Security Council resolutions. We
have always believed that a mutually acceptable plan,
reached after sincere negotiations by both parties
concerned, remains the best approach to the question of
Kosovo. The parties concerned should continue to
move in this direction.

We have noted that recently Serbia has held
intensive consultations with the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the
European Union (EU). Serbia has basically agreed with
the Secretary-General's six-point plan. We hope that
parties concerned will create conditions for a solution
to this issue in a constructive spirit.

We agree that a reconfiguration of UNMIK is, as
is pointed out by the Secretary-General in his report, of
a technical nature. It does not involve the status of
Kosovo, nor does it weaken the United Nations
position of neutrality on the question of Kosovo.

China will continue to support efforts by UNMIK
to implement its mandate under resolution 1244
(1999). Safeguarding the peace and stability of Kosovo
and the entire Balkan region is in the interest of all
parties concerned. We understand the EU's desire to
undertake an enhanced role in this regard. We hope that
European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo, to be
deployed by the EU, will perform its duties pursuant to
resolution 1244 (1999) and under the overall authority
of the United Nations.
