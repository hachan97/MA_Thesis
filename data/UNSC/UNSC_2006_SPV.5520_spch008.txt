Mr. Wahab: On behalf of the Secretary General
of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), I
would like to extend warm felicitations to you, Sir, on
your assumption of the presidency of the Security
Council for this eventful month. I would also like to
convey the OIC's appreciation to you and to all the
other members of the Security Council for having
invited us to take part in this open briefing on the
Sudan situation.

The OIC welcomes the presence of His
Excellency Secretary-General Kofi Annan at today's
meeting, and thanks him sincerely for his important
statement.

The Organization of the Islamic Conference joins
the rest of the international community in condemning
the heinous acts of terrorism committed on 11
September five years ago. The OIC reiterates its
commitment to combating international terrorism in
close cooperation with the rest of the international
community.

Although Secretary General Ihsanoglu was
unable to attend this meeting, he looks forward to
participating in the Security Council's meeting on
cooperation between the United Nations and regional
organizations, which you, Sir, have very kindly
scheduled for 20 September.

With regard to the Sudan situation, the OIC
maintains that any deployment of a United Nations
mission on the territory of the Sudan should be subject
to the consent of the Government of the Sudan. The
OIC Secretary General has been in contact with the
Government of the Sudan. Last week, he held a useful
discussion with the European Union's Special
Representative for the Sudan, Mr. Pekka Haavisto.
Next week, Secretary General Ihsanoglu will be
holding detailed consultations on the issue with leaders
of the African Union and the League of Arab States
here in New York.

The OIC will continue to play an active and
constructive role on the issue of Darfur at both the
political and humanitarian levels, with the cooperation
of the Government of the Sudan and in conformity with
international legitimacy.
