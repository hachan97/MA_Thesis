Mr. Araud (France) (spoke in French): France is
grateful to the United Nations Mission in the Sudan
(UNMIS), under the leadership of Special
Representative of the Secretary-General Menkerios, for
the outstanding work it has carried out since its
establishment, despite difficult working conditions, in
protecting civilians and ensuring follow-up to the
implementation of the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement of 2005, which led to independence for
South Sudan, celebrated this past Saturday.

France supported the adoption of resolution 1997
(2011) on the withdrawal of the United Nations
Mission in the Sudan. However, we regret that this
comes at a time when a ceasefire has yet to be signed
for Southern Kordofan. The civilian population
continues to suffer in the fighting, and humanitarian
access has not been re-established. Blue Nile state also
remains a source of concern for us.

We therefore call on the Government of the
Sudan to consider an international presence in these
two states. We urge the Government of the Sudan and
the Sudan People's Liberation Movement North to
cease their hostilities immediately, sign a ceasefire
agreement and conclude security arrangements in
Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states. We reiterate
the Security Council's readiness to support the parties
in expediting the implementation of such
arrangements.
