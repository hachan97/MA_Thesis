Mr. Omaish (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): At the
outset, I should like to thank the Prosecutor of the
International Criminal Court (ICC), Ms. Bensouda,
for introducing the nineteenth report of her Office,
pursuant to resolution 1593 (2005), and for her briefing
to the Council today.

Guaranteeing and upholding the principles of the
Rome Statute in delivering international criminal justice
and fighting impunity requires full cooperation with
the ICC so that it may fulfil its mandate, as highlighted
in the Prosecutor's report and in her briefing today.
Considering that the Security Council has referred
the case of the Sudan to the ICC, the persistence
of violations and the deterioration of the troubling
humanitarian conditions in the Sudan, as stated in
the report submitted by the Panel of Experts and the
African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in
Darfur, we reiterate the need to ensure full coordination
and cooperation with the Prosecutor of the ICC on the
part of all parties and countries in order to address the
deficiencies highlighted in the Prosecutor's report.

Jordan supports the recommendations presented
in the report and in today's briefing. We must spare
no effort in countering the suspicion that UNAMID
reports have been manipulated in an attempt to cover
up certain crimes.
