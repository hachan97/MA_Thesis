The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them

President transmitting the report of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Human Rights, and document

Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2003/334, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear an objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by a show of hands.

In favour:

France, Germany, Guinea, Mexico, Pakistan,

Ireland, United States of America

The President (spoke in French): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1468 (2003).

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
