Ms. Rice (United States of America): The United
States fully supports the Secretary-General and
Ambassador Christopher Ross in their efforts to find a
peaceful, sustainable and mutually agreed solution to
the Western Sahara conflict. This conflict has gone on
for too long. These ongoing strains, as well as poor
relations between Morocco and Algeria, have
prevented regional cooperation on urgent and emerging
issues facing North Africa.

We very much welcome the appointment of
Ambassador Ross to serve as the Secretary-General's
Personal Envoy for Western Sahara. He is a seasoned
diplomat with extensive experience in the region, and
he has our full support. During Ambassador Ross's
recent trip to the region, all of his interlocutors
confirmed their commitment to cooperate with the
United Nations to reach a solution to the Western
Sahara conflict as soon as possible. We welcome that
news.

We also concur with the assessment of
Ambassador Ross that informal preparatory talks may
help pave the way for more substantive formal talks.
We are glad that the parties have agreed to meet
informally, and we encourage all involved to come to
the table without preconditions. Given the current
situation on the ground, and Ambassador Ross's
continuing efforts, we agree that the presence of the
United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara (MINURSO) remains indispensable. The United
States supports renewing MINURSO's mandate for
another 12 months.
