Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): First of all, we are coming to the end of the
meeting and finally we are ending on a positive note. I
am very happy to hear the Foreign Minister of Australia
say that experts are ready to go back to the crash site.
That is indeed what we have called for in our statement
today.

But the Minister should understand that
Russia - and I have already said this - has attempted
to do everything possible to ensure security. But if the
Kyiv forces are shelling the area, then we say that we,
as the Security Council, should tell them not to do that.
But some Council members say, "No, we cannot call
upon the Kyiv authorities not to shell". Well, then, how
is Russia is going to ensure security in that case? How
can it?

I cited a specific example of how two times we
proposed that the Security Council call upon the
Ukrainian armed forces, when they said they wanted to
go into the area of the crash site, not to do so. But the
Council did not want to. Russia is doing everything it can
and drawing on the contacts it has with representatives
in the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics.
