Mr. Barros Melet (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): We
deeply regret that the draft resolution we have just voted
on (S/2014/348), which sought to refer the situation
in Syria to the International Criminal Court for the
investigation and subsequent punishment of those
responsible, whoever they may be, could not be adopted.
On many occasions Chile has joined those calling on
the countries that enjoy the right of veto to refrain from
using it in situations involving crimes against humanity,
war crimes, genocide or ethnic cleansing. We believe
that the Security Council should have the ability to act
in support of the values and principles that are most
fundamental for humankind. Chile sponsored the draft
resolution in a spirit of openness and in the conviction
that it represented a necessary step in obtaining justice
for all the victims of the conflict in Syria, without any
distinction between the various sides.

Our country is a party to the Rome Statute and,
as such, we believe that its integrity must be upheld so
as to enable it to be fully implemented and effective
in the fight against impunity. The International
Criminal Court has shown itself to be the best tool
for investigating the acts that have produced the draft
resolution that could not be adopted today.
