Ms. Salamanca (spoke in Spanish): I thank the
Council for the questions. I should also like to thank
the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Colombia for
his statement.

I take this opportunity to express gratitude for
the interest shown in the issue of gender and to kindly
call on the Government to make progress in the
specific matters related to this topic. As set out in the
development plan, there is a pact for gender equity. We
kindly ask Member States to ensure that the plan be
given sufficient resources and institutional capacity with
robust institutions that will enable such a programme to
truly have an impact. We believe that the resources are
still lacking and that they therefore need to be allocated
in order to achieve a cross-cutting impact.

I also believe it is important to say that within the
Special Jurisdiction for Peace, we are convinced that
the international benchmarks for sexual violence should
be respected. Finally, we would like to emphasize
that there should be a recommendation to implement
such a programme of guarantees for women leaders
in peacebuilding.

I agree that the agreement is not an easy path.
It is complex and challenging but it also enables
the promotion and strengthening of the political
social, cultural changes required for the future of the
country. This is a path towards coexistence and future
reconciliation. In leveraging it we will strengthen
democracy, promote well-being and prevent violence
and suffering. In such a task we as women will remain
committed to ethical standards so as to achieve a
peaceful country.
