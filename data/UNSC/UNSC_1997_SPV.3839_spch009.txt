Mr. Qin Huasun (China) (interpretation from Chinese): We welcome the fact that the general situation
in the former Yugoslavia is stable and continuing to
improve. In our view, the continued maintenance of
stability in the former Yugoslavia is conducive to the
development of friendly and good-neighbourly relations
and economic reconstruction by the countries of the
region.

We are pleased to note that Macedonia and the other
countries of the region are working towards the
improvement of their mutual relations. We hope that
these countries will continue to take effective measures,
resolve their remaining differences, and soon begin living
together in harmony, as is consistent with the
fundamental interests of their peoples.

The task of the United Nations Preventive
Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) is to prevent the
spillover of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia into
Macedonia. We have noted the recommendations by the
Secretary-General and the interested parties on the
question of extending UNPREDEP's mandate. We feel
that its extension should be considered in conjunction
with the current situation of stability in the region. We
wish to reiterate that the political independence,
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Macedonia should
be respected.

Taking into account the request by Macedonia, the
country concerned, for an extension of UNPREDEP's
mandate, and on the basis of our consistent position, the
Security Council 3839th meeting
Fifty-second year 4 December 1997

Chinese delegation will vote in favour of the draft
resolution.
