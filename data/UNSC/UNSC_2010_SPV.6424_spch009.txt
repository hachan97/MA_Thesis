The President: I thank Mr. Heller for his
briefing, and all three Chairmen for their important
personal comments and recommendations, which will
be very valuable to their successors.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers
to limit their statements to no more than five minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing and to
deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.
I now give the floor to the members of the
Council.
