Mr. Al-Bader (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): We
would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Egeland
for his briefing on developments in the humanitarian
situation in Darfur and in northern Uganda. We would
also like to thank him for his efforts to deal with the
humanitarian situation throughout the area. It is
regrettable to see the deterioration of the situation in
both areas, as described by Mr. Egeland in his briefing,
in particular the impact of this deterioration on women
and children, the two groups most vulnerable to
insecurity and instability.

In his statement, Mr. Egeland referred to the
Addis Ababa agreement between the African Union
and the Government of the Sudan and the positive
impact of that agreement. We hope that the agreement
will last and that it will make it possible for peace and
stability to reign once again in Darfur and for the
situation of refugees and the displaced persons to be
resolved. My delegation looks forward to the
Secretary-General's report on the agreement, which is
to be introduced this afternoon in our informal
consultations.

As regards the peace process for northern
Uganda, we affirm the importance of Mr. Egeland's
recommendations, in particular regarding the need to
support and assist in the ongoing negotiations between
the Government of Uganda and the Lord's Resistance
Army (LRA) in order to attain permanent peace in
northern Uganda. We also welcome the Juba peace
process, which we view as the cornerstone of the
ceasefire between the Ugandan Government and the
LRA. We cannot fail to thank the Government of
Southern Sudan for its mediation and for facilitating
meetings between the parties.
