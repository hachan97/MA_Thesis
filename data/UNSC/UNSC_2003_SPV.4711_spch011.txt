Mr. Aguilar Zinser (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish):
My delegation too would like to express its gratitude
for the information that has been provided to the
members of the Council by Mr. Guehenno,
Mr. Nishimura and Mr. Braun. In particular, we would
like to thank Mr. Nishimura and Japan for their
outstanding work in maintaining the international
community's commitment to Afghanistan's
reconstruction. We would also like to recognize and
express appreciation for the work being done by
Ambassador Braun and Germany in putting together a
police force that will make possible the establishment
of a reliable legal order in Afghanistan.

In that regard, I would like to know whether, in
the light of the information provided to us by
Ambassador Braun, a great effort is being made to
establish a police force that will have a decisive
presence throughout the country and that will secure
the borders while providing domestic police
enforcement. Given the prevailing circumstances in
Afghanistan, we would like to know what mechanisms
are envisaged to coordinate efforts to create a national
police force with the establishment of provincial police
forces. Is that an issue that will ultimately have to be
resolved in the process of drafting a new constitution?
The very decisive role that a national police force
might play in contributing to the establishment of the
rule of law vis-a-vis the various armed factions fighting
for power in the provinces will in fact be a force for
political stability. But in order to achieve that there will
be a need to confront the various factions that are
likely to dispute areas of jurisdiction. How would
Ambassador Braun envisage that consolidation process
taking place? What degree of conflict will arise in
Afghanistan as a result of an attempt to establish a
national police force with authority over any other
armed or police forces in the provinces?
