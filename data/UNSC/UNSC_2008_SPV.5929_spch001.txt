The President: As this is the first meeting of the
Security Council for the month of July 2008, I should
like to take this opportunity to pay tribute, on behalf of
the Council, to Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad,
Permanent Representative of the United States of
America to the United Nations, for his service as
President of the Security Council for the month of June
2008. I am sure I speak for all members of the Council
in expressing deep appreciation to Ambassador
Khalilzad for the great diplomatic skill with which he
conducted the Council's business last month.
