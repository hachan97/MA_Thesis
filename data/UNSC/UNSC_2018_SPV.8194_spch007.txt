Mr. Van Oosterom (Netherlands): We thank
Cote d'Ivoire for its arduous work in trying to ensure
the support of the Security Council for the efforts of
the West African region to resolve the deadlock in
Guinea-Bissau. We continue to support and endorse
the mediation efforts of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) and its imposition of
sanctions. ECOWAS has consistently demonstrated
that, when united, it has the ability to act as the region's
power-broker, as it did in the crisis in The Gambia
last year. Like then, the Council should also firmly
demonstrate its support for ECOWAS in assuming that
role and responsibility.

The African Union has unequivocally supported the
efforts of ECOWAS and has, through its Chairperson,
asked us to follow suit. The political actors in Guinea-
Bissau should realize that resolution 2404 (2018),
adopted today, speaks in clear words of the Council's
readiness to take additional measures to respond to
the possible further worsening of the situation in the
country. We hope that it is a message that will resonate
in Guinea-Bissau and be heard by ECOWAS and the
African Union.

The resolution supports the concerted action
taken thus far to achieve tangible progress in finally
resolving the Guinea-Bissau crisis. Let us all continue

to support the concerted action ofthe five actors on the
ground: ECOWAS, the African Union, the Community
of Portuguese-speaking Countries, the United Nations
and the European Union.

The meeiing rose at 10.30 a.m.
