Mr. Umarov (Kazakhstan): We voted in favour of
resolution 2393 (2017), on cross-border assistance in
accordance with the following points. We thank everyone
who took an active part in the process of drafting this
important document, and we would like to thank the
penholders for humanitarian issues - the Missions of
Sweden, Egypt and Japan - for their excellent work.
We express our gratitude to all delegations that have
made important compromises in this matter. That is a
demonstration of the fact that by showing unity we can
do much.

Kazakhstan remains committed to all Security
Council resolutions aimed at resolving humanitarian
issues in Syria. We believe that it is very important
to preserve all possible humanitarian access
modalities, including cross-border systems, which are
indispensable in bringing humanitarian aid to millions
of people in northern and southern Syria. Cross-border
assistance, as authorized under resolution 2165 (2014)
and subsequent resolutions, remains a critical element
of the humanitarian response in Syria. However,
we urge United Nations humanitarian agencies and
their implementing partners to closely monitor the
management of cross-border aid in order to benefit
those in need. Kazakhstan supports all international
efforts aimed at finding a political solution to the
Syrian crisis. We hope that agreements reached within
the frameworks of the Astana platform and the Geneva
process will be fully implemented.

Lastly, we are convinced that only full compliance
with the ceasefire agreement will directly improve
the humanitarian situation and reduce the level of
violence. However, we stress that no initiative aimed at
establishing peace in the world's conflict zones can be
successful without the support of the Security Council.
