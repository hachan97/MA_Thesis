Mrs. Cedano (Dominican Republic) (spoke in Spanish): The Dominican Republic welcomes the adoption of resolution 2543 (2020) because it is a balanced text that effectively supports the work of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). We commend the penholders for their excellent work throughout the negotiation process. At a time when intra-Afghan talks have begun and efforts for lasting peace in Afghanistan look promising, it is important that UNAMA continue to play a key role in maintaining and promoting the economic, political and social achievements reached thus far. The success of the peace process in Afghanistan requires not only political will and the vigorous support of the international community, but also the leadership and representation of all sectors of Afghan society, especially young people. We reiterate our call for initiatives to eliminate violence against women, the implementation of the national action plan in support of resolution 1325 (2000) and the protection of children's rights. We hope that, in a not-too-distant future, the provisions we unanimously adopted in resolution 2535 (2020), on youth, peace and security, can be reflected in UNAMA's mandate. In conclusion, only a strong resolution, like that adopted today, can confirm our commitment to peace in Afghanistan and recognize the sacrifices and challenges that the entire personnel of UNAMA faces on a daily basis.
