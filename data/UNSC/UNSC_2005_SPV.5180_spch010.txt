Mr. Poirier (France) (spoke in French): We fully
associate ourselves with the statement to be made later
by the Permanent Representative of Luxembourg on
behalf of the European Union. I will restrict myself to
just a few brief comments.

First, we congratulate the people and the
authorities of Timor-Leste on the progress made in that
country in the three years since independence. State
institutions have been strengthened, and democracy is
growing.

Secondly, as the United Nations Mission of
Support in East Timor (UNMISET) is preparing for the
handover of its mission, we would like to join our
colleagues in congratulating the Special Representative
of the Secretary-General, Mr. Hasegawa, and his staff
for their decisive contribution to its success.

Thirdly, while the Timorese people have the
primary responsibility for ensuring long-term stability,
the United Nations, as Mr. Annabi has said, will
continue to play an essential supporting role through
the United Nations Office in Timor-Leste (UNOTIL).
We have every confidence in the continued action of
the Secretariat during the peace consolidation phase. I
note that this sets a good example prior to the debate
that we will have here on this subject in a few days'
time.

Finally, I would like to underscore with
satisfaction the continuing improvement of relations
between Timor-Leste and its neighbours, first and
foremost Indonesia. The visit of the President of
Indonesia and the agreement that has been signed
relating to 96 per cent of the land border is testimony
to that. We will continue to closely follow future
progress on remaining border issues. We will continue
to attach the greatest importance to the work of the
Commission of Experts on serious crimes committed in
1999.
