Mr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I
thank you, Sir, for convening today's meeting. I also
thank the representative of the United Kingdom for
his statement.

In line with Chapter VI of the Charter of the United
Nations, we believe that it is important to update the
Security Council on situations that could give rise to
an international dispute. Peru believes that the use of
chemical weapons is a threat to international peace
and security, violates the non-proliferation regime and
endangers the lives of civilians. Therefore, we express
our deep concern about the use of a nerve agent in a
public area, which put the lives of at least three people
in the United Kingdom in serious danger. We deplore
the fact that the incident occurred and express our
solidarity with the victims. The incident should be
investigated within the framework of the rule of law
and due process, through the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and other competent
entities. The parties concerned must fully cooperate
to ensure a credible investigation that determines
and punishes those responsible in line with relevant
international law.

In conclusion, we stress that communication
channels must remain open in order to resolve
the situation.
