Mr. Shen Bo (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
welcomes the establishment of the Multinational Joint
Task Force (MNJTF) by countries in the region - such
as Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, the Niger and Benin, as
well as the positive progress that they have achieved
in combating terrorism. We appreciate the unwavering
determination and tireless efforts of countries in the
region in combating terrorism. We support countries in
the region to strengthen coordination and cooperation
with the African Union, the Economic Community
of West African States, the Economic Community
of Central African States and the Lake Chad Basin
Commission. While respecting the principles of the
sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of
countries in the region, the international community
should vigorously help those countries to step up their
counter-terrorism capabilities and support the MNJTF
in carrying out operations effectively so as to improve
the humanitarian situation therein.

The Security Council should concentrate on
sending a positive message pledging the international
community's support for the efforts of the countries
in the region in combating terrorism and mitigating
the humanitarian situation. China has always believed
that, if members of the Security Council have concerns
about a draft resolution, full attention should be given
to all such concerns and they should be reflected in
the relevant text so as to make the maximum effort to
achieve consensus on a draft resolution.
