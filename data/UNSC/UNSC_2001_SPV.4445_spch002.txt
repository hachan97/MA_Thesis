Mr. Mahbubani (Singapore): This is just a
procedural suggestion that I hope our colleagues will
agree with. I thought that, as a gesture of courtesy, we
might allow the departing members of the Council to
speak first, in alphabetical order. If the President agrees
with my suggestion, after we have heard the departing
members - with the possible exception of the
President, who may want to speak last - then the rest
of us can raise our hands to speak.
