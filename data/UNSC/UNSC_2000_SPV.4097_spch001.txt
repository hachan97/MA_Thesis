Permanent Representative of the United States to the United
Nations, for his excellent service as President of the
Security Council for the month of January 2000. I am sure
I speak for all members of the Council in expressing deep
appreciation to Ambassador Holbrooke for the diplomatic
skills, energy, talent and dedication with which he
conducted the Council's business last month.
