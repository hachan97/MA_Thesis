Mr. Buallay (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): This
meeting has been convened by the Security Council in
conditions of extreme urgency. The Belgrade authorities
have been given one opportunity after another to reach a
peaceful settlement to the problem of Kosovo. The party
representing the Kosovar Albanians had agreed to a
peaceful settlement at Rambouillet and had signed the
agreement. The Serb side, however, refused to sign and has
continued to use extreme force in the Kosovo region,
causing thousands of casualties and displacing thousands of
persons. The result is a humanitarian crisis of tremendous
proportions that cannot be resolved without the cooperation
of neighbouring States.

In view of this situation, we were not able to vote in
favour of the draft resolution before the Council today,
because it would have encouraged the Belgrade authorities
to continue with their current policy of "ethnic cleansing"
and led to more massacres and displacements for the
Kosovar Albanians.
