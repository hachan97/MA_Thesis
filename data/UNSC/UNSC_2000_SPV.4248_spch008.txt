Mr. Wang Yingfan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
Two months have elapsed since the most recent
outbreak of conflict between Palestine and Israel, with
casualties on both sides, but with heavy civilian
injuries on the Palestinian side in particular. The Israeli
blockade has subjected the large civilian population of
Palestine to hardship in their daily life. To date, there
has been no sign of a de-escalation of the situation on
the ground. The peace process in the Middle East is
therefore faced with a severe test.

China is deeply concerned about the situation and
reiterates its opposition to violent activities of any
kind. China calls upon both parties to stay calm and
heed reason and, in the fundamental and long-term
interests of the peoples of the region, to adopt all
necessary measures to prevent the situation from
worsening further.

The Security Council has recently been
discussing the possibility of dispatching United
Nations or international observers to the region. In an
effort to defuse the conflict between Palestine and
Israel and to maintain peace and security in the Middle
East, the Security Council should effectively fulfil its
responsibilities, as mandated by the United Nations
Charter. Not only would that be in the interests of
Palestine and Israel, but it is the ardent hope of the
majority of the States Members of the United Nations.
The Chinese Government has therefore steadfastly
worked to achieve the goal of dispatching observers to
the region. We support the draft resolution submitted to
the Council by the Non-Aligned Movement caucus. We

hope that the United Nations observers can be
deployed to the region as soon as possible.

We will continue our support for the mediation
efforts of the Secretary-General and all the parties
concerned, and stand ready to make our own
contribution to putting an end to the violent situation
and restoring the peace process in the Middle East.
