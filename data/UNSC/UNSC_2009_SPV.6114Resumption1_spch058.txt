Mr. Edrees (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I would
like to start by expressing our appreciation to you, Sir,
for convening this debate on the comprehensive report
(S/2009/158) submitted by the Secretary-General on
children and armed conflict, and to his Special
Representative for Children and Armed Conflict,
Ms. Radhika Coomaraswamy, for her objective and
balanced briefing, which exposed the grave violations
that children face in armed conflicts, including killing,
maiming, rape and sexual violence, abduction,
recruitment, attacks on schools and hospitals being
used as shelters, denial of humanitarian access, their
use as human shields, and arbitrary detention, in
violation of international law, international
humanitarian law and human rights law.

The report adopts a constructive, pragmatic and
cooperative approach towards all situations reported,
researched, monitored and investigated. It was drafted
following broad consultations with all United Nations
entities and relevant task forces committed to the
principles of dialogue and target-sharing, as well as
with Governments that hold the primary responsibility
for protecting children. Such cooperation has
ultimately led to some progress in such countries as
Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
the Philippines and Colombia, and to positive
developments on issues related to violence against
children in the Sudan. Those developments include the
adoption of a presidential decree of pardon for 99
children out of 110 recruited by the Justice and
Equality Movement, who attacked Omdurman and
were captured by the Sudan Armed Forces, and the
cooperation of the Government of the Sudan with the
United Nations in addressing violations by rebel
groups against children on both sides, in investigating
Government violations and in bringing proven
perpetrators to justice.

However, despite all the efforts and field visits,
the report paints a disturbing picture of ongoing

violence against children in conflict zones and of new
forms of violence in some of those areas. This
phenomenon requires close coordination between the
Security Council, the General Assembly and the
Human Rights Council in studying the root causes of
the increased use of children in armed conflicts, the
main causes of violence against children, and the
means to fully implement international standards and
to guarantee full respect for international law and
international humanitarian law, including through the
revitalization and implementation of the Optional
Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child,
in order to prevent any involvement of children in
armed conflicts.

We have followed with great concern the grave
atrocities perpetrated by the Israel Defense Forces
against children in Lebanon and the Palestinian
occupied territories, including the illegal use of cluster
munitions by Israel during the 2006 attacks on
defenceless people in the villages, schools and farms of
Lebanon, as revealed and recorded in the report and
monitored by various United Nations agencies. We
demand that the Security Council ensure Israel's
cooperation with the United Nations and the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General for Children
and Armed Conflict by handing over relevant data,
including the necessary information on landmines and
cluster bomb sites. That would allow those munitions
to be cleared and prevent the victimization of more
children exposed to the threat of explosive remnants of
war in the affected areas; yet Israel continues to ignore
all the Special Representative's appeals in that regard.

As for Gaza and the occupied Palestinian
territories, the report reveals old and ongoing grave
violations by Israel against Palestinian children. These
include the killing of thousands by the Israel Defense
Forces and the injuring and maiming of thousands
more by the use of phosphoric bombs, missile strikes,
internationally prohibited ammunition, tank fire, aerial
bombardment and rubber-coated bullets in numerous
ongoing attacks by Israeli settlers against children in
villages. The Israel Defense Forces have also used
Palestinian children as human shields, bombing
schools and killing and injuring the students and
teachers therein. Israeli settlers, too, have attacked
schools, including those of the United Nations Relief
and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near
East and others, hospitals, infrastructure and
humanitarian relief agencies, and have severely
hindered access to humanitarian assistance and medical
relief services. All of these acts violate international
law and call for the direct intervention of the Security
Council to ensure that these atrocities are effectively
addressed and prevented from recurring and that their
perpetrators are brought to justice.

In so doing, the Security Council and the General
Assembly must give due attention to the
implementation of the recommendations adopted by
the Committee on the Rights of the Child following its
review of the first and only report submitted by Israel,
in 2002, on the implementation of its commitments
under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The
Government of Israel continues to completely ignore
those recommendations, which include taking all
immediate and necessary measures to end violence
against children; taking all immediate and necessary
measures to prevent the recruitment and use of children
in armed conflicts; investigating forthwith all incidents
of the killing or injuring of children and bringing the
perpetrators to justice; and compensating the victims of
human rights violations, especially children, and
rehabilitating and reintegrating them into society.

At the same time, we demand that Israel
implement the recommendations set forth by the
Human Rights Council at its most recent session
concerning the universal periodic review of the
situation of human rights in Israel, in particular those
related to Palestinian children under occupation.

Egypt supports the Secretary-General's
recommendation that the criteria set out in the annexes
of the report be broadened to include not only those
perpetrators convicted of recruiting children as soldiers
and of sexual violence against children, but also those
guilty of all six forms of grave violations against
children in armed conflict, on the condition that
indictment relies on verified data, field visits and field
follow-ups, as well as data collected through the
coordinated efforts of all the relevant United Nations
agencies and programmes, in close consultation with
the Governments concerned and with the support of all
United Nations Member States.

In conclusion, there is a special role for the
Security Council's Working Group on Children and
Armed Conflict. We believe it is necessary to follow up
on its recommendations, which were adopted after
careful study of each situation and after due
consultation with parties concerned, including
Governments and the Special Representative for
Children and Armed Conflicts, specially those
recommendations regarding children in the occupied
Arab territories. We also stress how important it is for
the Working Group to take into consideration
recommendations adopted by the Committee on the
Rights of the Child regarding the situation of children
in armed conflict, bearing in mind the Committee's
role as a comprehensive mechanism bringing together
expertise from many Member States with a value-
added perspective that should be used to ensure that its
potential benefit is realized to the greatest extent
possible.
