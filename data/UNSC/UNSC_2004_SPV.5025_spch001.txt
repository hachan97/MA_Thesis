the representatives of Afghanistan, Canada, Iceland,
Japan, the Netherlands and Uzbekistan, in which they
request to be invited to participate in the discussion of
the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with
the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the
Council, to invite those representatives to participate in
the discussion, Without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Farhddi
