I am speaking in my capacity as Security Council Facilitator for the implementation of resolution 2231 (2015). Since having been appointed as Facilitator for the implementation of resolution 2231 (2015) in January 2019 for a two-year period, it has been an honour for me to serve the Council in the exercise of this mandate. While carrying out this task, I have been able to count on the unwavering support of the Secretariat, and I thank them for their commitment. According to paragraph 3 of presidential note S/2016/44, "(t]he facilitator shall brief the other members of the Council on its work and the implementation of the resolution every six months, in parallel with the report submitted by the Secretary-General". The report of the Facilitator is aimed at being a factual and objective account, through which the Security Council is informed of the activities that took place in the 2231 format of the Council, in conjunction with the reports of the Secretary-General and the Joint Commission. It is an agreed text that reflects the Council's comments and approval, under a no-objection procedure, and, when submitted to the President of the Security Council, it is a report that reflects consensus by the Council. Unfortunately, I have to inform members that the ninth report of the Facilitator (see S/2020/508) has not been approved by all the members of the Council. Informal consultations with the members concerned were held exhaustively with a view to reaching a consensus, but to no avail. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members for their written comments, active contributions and flexibility. In lieu of having no report at this point in time, I would like to brief members on some of the key highlights of the activities of the 2231 format that took place during the six-month reporting period from 17 December 2019 to 23 June 2020. First, the Security Council, in the 2231 format, held two informal meetings via a closed video-teleconference: a meeting on 13 May 2020 to discuss the 22 April 2020 space satellite launch by the Islamic Republic of Iran, and a meeting on 22 June 2020 to discuss the findings and recommendations contained in the ninth report of the Secretary-General (S/2020/531) on resolution 2231 (2015), prior to its public release. Secondly, the two regular quarterly reports issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) during the past six months, in March (S/2020/307, enclosure) and June (S/2020/548, enclosure), were also circulated to the 2231 representatives for their information. Thirdly, I would like to thank Member States that sent official communications addressed either to the President of the Security Council, the Secretary-General and/or myself, which were circulated within the 2231 format during this six-month period. There were a total of 21 letters from nine Member States circulated. These letters reflect the state of deliberations among the parties on the main topics at stake in relation to the implementation of resolution 2231 (2015). I deeply regret that I am not in a position to present a written overview of those contributions, which are central to our debate. * Lastly, I note that there were four proposals submitted to the Security Council for approval, through the procurement channel, during the past six months. In conclusion, let me simply join with the other bodies responsible for the implementation ofresolution 2231 (2015), the Secretary-General, the Joint Commission and the IAEA in strongly regretting the deterioration of the current context, which affects compliance with resolution 2231 (2015) and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. I would therefore like to end my briefing by reiterating paragraph 2 of resolution 2231 (2015), which calls upon all "Member States, regional organizations and international organizations to take such actions as may be appropriate to support the implementation of JCPOA, including by ... refraining from actions that undermine implementation of commitments under the JCPOA".*
