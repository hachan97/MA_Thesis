Ms. Power (United States ofAmerica): The United
States is pleased to support the adoption of a Security
Council resolution that sends a clear message. All
parties in Yemen, especially the Houthi, must commit
to resolving the country's political crisis by consensus
through a peaceful and inclusive dialogue.

Today, the Council deplores unilateral attempts by
the Houthi to take over Government institutions and to
dissolve Parliament by force, and the Council reaffirms
the road map for implementing Yemen's transition
provided by the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative
and Implementation Mechanism and the outcomes of
the comprehensive National Dialogue Conference. The
people onemen deserve a clear path back to the political
transition process and a legitimate Government based
on these agreements and the resolutions of the Council
with a publicly announced timeline and specific dates
for the completion of a new constitution, a constitutional
referendum and national elections.

We continue to strongly support the efforts of the
Special Adviser to the Secretary-General, Mr. Jamal
Benomar, to mediate a consensus solution to this
political crisis - a process vital to defusing tensions on
the ground. We also underscore the Security Council's
demand for the Houthi to release President Hadi
Mansour, Prime Minister Bahah and other members
of the Cabinet from house arrest immediately. Their
continued detention is unacceptable, and they must
be granted full freedom of movement. We strongly
condemn the use of force against peaceful protesters in
Ibb on 14 February.

The United States will continue supporting all
Yemenis who are working toward a peaceful, prosperous
and unified Yemen.
