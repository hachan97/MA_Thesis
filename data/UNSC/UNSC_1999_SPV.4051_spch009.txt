Mr. Vamos-Goldman (Canada): Canada fully
supports this resolution. It is appropriate and necessary
that the Security Council take action to support the fight
against terrorism. The adoption of this resolution
demonstrates the international community's resolve in this
regard, and we hope that it will assist in the process of
bringing to justice those responsible for the bombings in
Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998.

Canada's concern over the situation in Afghanistan
goes beyond terrorism. In our view, the Taliban's flouting
of human rights and humanitarian law and principles
warrants further international action. The Secretary-
General's report of 21 September 1999 paints a stark
picture of deteriorating conditions for civilians in
Afghanistan, particularly for women and children. Taliban
actions and policies play an important part in making
Afghanistan one of the deadliest places on earth.

We therefore look forward to a further resolution by
the Security Council to address the appalling humanitarian
and human rights situation in Afghanistan, which has
given rise to so much instability in the region.
