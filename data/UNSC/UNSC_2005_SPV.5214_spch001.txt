The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them copies
of document S/2005/406, which contains the text of a
letter dated 20 June 2005 from the Secretary-General
addressed to the President of the Security Council
concerning the United Nations Monitoring, Verification
and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) escrow
account established under Security Council resolution
1284 (1999) and related resolutions.

Members of the Council also have before them
the draft of a letter that I, as President of the Security
Council, propose to send to the Secretary-General
in reply to the aforementioned letter, approving the
proposal contained in the Secretary-General's letter to
transfer $200 million from the UNMOVIC escrow
account to the Development Fund for Iraq, and
$20,256,697 to be credited against assessments issued
in respect of the obligations of the Government of Iraq
for regular budget, peacekeeping and tribunal activities
and the capital master plan of the Organization.

In the absence of objection, I shall assume that
the Security Council endorses the proposal of the
Secretary-General and agrees that I should send the
letter, as drafted, to the Secretary-General.

It is so decided.

The reply will be issued as a document of the
Council under symbol S/2005/407.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on the
agenda.

The meeting rose at 10.25 am.
