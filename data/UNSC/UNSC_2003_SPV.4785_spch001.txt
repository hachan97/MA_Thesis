The President (spoke in Spanish): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Sir Jeremy Greenstock, head of the
Security Council mission to West Africa.

It is so decided.

In accordance with the understanding reached in
the Council's prior consultations, and in the absence of
objection, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Adolfo Aguilar
Zinser, head of mission in Guinea-Bissau and
Chairman of the Security Council sanctions Committee
on Sierra Leone.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
photocopies of the report of the Security Council
mission to West Africa. This report will be issued as a

I now call on Sir Jeremy Greenstock, head of the
Security Council mission to West Africa.
