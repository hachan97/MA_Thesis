The President: On behalf of the Council, I wish to
thank Minister Judeh and the Hashemite Kingdom for
their service and the peacekeeping they undertake, as
well as for the extraordinary work done with refugees.
We are all very grateful.

It is now my privilege to give the floor to the Minister
for Foreign Affairs and International Development for
France.
