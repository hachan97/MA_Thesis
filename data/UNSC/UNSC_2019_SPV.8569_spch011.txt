The President (spoke in Spanish): We had thought
that we would still be able to count on the presence
of the representative of China for the next meeting
of the Council, but since he has announced that this
will probably be his last, I should like to take this
opportunity to express to Ambassador Ma Zhaoxu
our special appreciation and deep recognition for his
extraordinary efforts and the work that he has done in
the Council during his tenure here. I should like to add
that it has been a privilege to work with him on the
many important issues on the international agenda. I
believe that I speak also for the other members of the
Council in wishing every success to the Ambassador in
his new responsibilities and, once again, I extend my
gratitude to him.
