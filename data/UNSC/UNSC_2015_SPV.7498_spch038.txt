Mr. Percaya (Indonesia): I would like to thank
you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting on the
subject of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, which is
of great importance to us. My delegation also thanks
Malaysia for initiating the proposal on that issue.

It has been one year since the deeply troubling
downing of Flight MH-l7. But the pain and sorrow at the
deaths of all those who perished in this most inhumane
event, who included Indonesians, has not diminished.

It is deeply regrettable that the Council has failed
to unite in taking measures to address the issues related
to the downing of Flight MH-17. Indonesia, and, I
believe, all other grieving nations owe it to the victims
of this tragedy and their families to take effective
measures. There must be appropriate measures to hold
those responsible accountable, and there should also be
clear measures to prevent similar incidents from ever
happening again. This includes ensuring the observance
of international law, particularly relevant international
humanitarian law, greater international cooperation;
and an unequivocal combined stand that such incidents
will not be tolerated.
Indonesia reiterates its support for resolution 2166
(2014) and urges the Council to fulfil its commitment
and responsibility to take all follow-up measures to
fully implement the resolution, including to bring
those responsible for the downing of MH-l7 to justice.
Several countries have worked together in the past
year to provide clarity to those affected by the tragedy.
In this regard, Indonesia welcomes the investigation
process, including the efforts undertaken by the
Joint Investigation Team. My delegation underscores
the importance of a comprehensive, thorough and
independent investigation, with an emphasis on
transparency and impartiality, which should serve as
the basis for establishing accountability.

Finally, my delegation calls upon the Council to
continue its work to forge consensus on all appropriate
measures to that end.
