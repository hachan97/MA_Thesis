Mr. Musayev (Azerbaijan): At the outset, I would
like to thank Ambassador Nestor Osorio for his work
as Chair of the Committee established pursuant to
resolution 1737 (2006) and for his comprehensive
briefing on the activities of the Committee. We note
the reappointment of the Panel of Experts created
pursuant to paragraph 29 of resolution 1929 (2010) and
the extension of its mandate until 9 June 2013. It is
essential that the Panel of Experts continue its outreach
activities, which play an important role in increasing
the number of national implementation reports from
Member States. We note the efforts made by the
Committee to enhance implementation of the sanctions
measures. We also take note of the submission of the
programme of work, which covers the Panel's approach
to its work for the period 2012-2013, and we stand ready
to engage in discussions in that regard.

In accordance with its international obligations,
Azerbaijan has taken all necessary measures to
prevent the use of its territory as a transit route for
the illicit trafficking of items and materials related
to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and weapons
technology. It is obvious that the issues concerning
our immediate neighbour, Iran, are of particular
importance for my country. It is essential to continue
dialogue and cooperation on the issues for which
progress is urgent for regional stability. We support the
right of any country to develop its nuclear industry for
peaceful purposes in full accordance with the relevant
international obligations. It is therefore important that
all necessary steps be taken by the Government of Iran
to build international confidence in the exclusively
peaceful nature of its nuclear programme.

We encourage further efforts, through dialogue and
diplomacy, aimed at resolving the issues of concern
peacefully and in a constructive manner.
