Mrs. Gueguen Mohsen (France) (spoke in French):
France welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution
2352 (2017), renewing the mandate of the United
Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) for
six months. It is indeed crucial to continue to closely
follow the situation between the Sudan and South
Sudan and to align the mission with its mandate.

Stable relations between the Sudan and South Sudan
are a major determinant for peace and security in West
Africa. France welcomes the activities of Ethiopia,
which, through its soldiers deployed to UNISFA, is
contributing to that goal with resolve and dedication.
Stable relations between the Sudan and South Sudan
are first and foremost in the hands of the two parties.
The agreements signed by the two parties in 2011 and
2012 are the road map to be followed to ensure that
stability, which requires a change in the status quo.

We therefore welcome the resolution's call on
the parties to live up to their responsibilities in this
framework and to make the necessary progress in
managing their relations. In this connection, we
recall our support for the African Union High-Level
Implementation Panel, headed by President Mbeki, in its
ongoing and stepped-up efforts for the implementation
ofthe agreements between the two parties. The meeting
of the Joint Political and Security Mechanism in Addis
Ababa over the past few days is a welcome development,
and we hope that the commitments undertaken will be
fully implemented.
