Mr. Franco (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): We
are very grateful for the information given to us today
by Mr. Guehenno about the achievements of recent
days. Those achievements demonstrate the parties'
genuine commitment to the implementation of the
peace Agreement signed in December last year. We
invite the parties to continue to display that positive
and constructive attitude, in order to reach an
understanding on pending issues. In that regard, we
would like to highlight the activities of the Border
Commission, the establishment of an air corridor and
the signing by one of the parties of the status-of-forces
agreement.

We had prepared some questions, but they were
answered by Mr. Guehenno this morning. However, we
wanted to take the floor in order to reiterate what has
been emphasized by other speakers: it is important that
the return of internally displaced persons and refugees
should be carried out in an orderly manner, so as to
prevent the clear risk of this becoming a humanitarian
crisis. That is why we would like to ask the Secretariat
to keep us informed about this matter.
