The President (interpretation from Spanish): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Georgia in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the discussion without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Chkheidze
(Georgia) took a place at the Council table.

The President (interpretation from Spanish): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General concerning the situation in
Abkhazia, Georgia, contained in documents 8/1995/10 and
Addenda l and 2.

Members of the Council also have before them
document 8/1995/23, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations.

The first speaker is the representative of Georgia, and
I now call on him.
