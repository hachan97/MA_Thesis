The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Mr. Brahimi for his forceful, important and
comprehensive briefing, reflecting the outstanding
work that he has done in Afghanistan. That is a tribute
not only to the Secretariat, but to the Organization as a
whole.

In accordance with the understanding reached in
the Council's prior consultations, I should like now to
invite Council members to informal consultations to
continue our discussion on the subject.

The meeting rose at 11.05 am.
