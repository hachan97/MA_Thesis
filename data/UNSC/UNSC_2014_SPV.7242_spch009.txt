Mr. Barros Melet (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): I
would like to start by thanking the United Kingdom
for preparing resolution 2170 (2014), which the Council
has just adopted. We also thank Member States for their
flexibility in achieving consensus.

Chile sponsored the resolution because we believe
that, through it, the Security Council is responding to
the urgent need to put a stop to the advance and attacks
by the Islamic State in the Levant (ISIL) in Iraq and
Syria. In that context, we hope that the unanimous
adoption of the resolution will serve as a reminder of
how important it is to decisively condemn and combat
the terrorism affecting the region. We would like to
appeal to Member States to fulfil their obligations
in implementing and enforcing compliance with the
financial sanctions and to take targeted measures to put
an end to the flow of foreign terrorist fighters.

Chile would like to underscore the universal
validity of human rights and international humanitarian
law, including the rights of minorities. Observing
and ensuring respect for those rights is essential for
democratic governance and social peace in culturally
and religiously diverse States.
