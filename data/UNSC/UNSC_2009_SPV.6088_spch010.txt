Mr. Dabbashi (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, I would like to welcome Her
Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Greece
and to thank her for her update on the work of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) and on the priorities that organization will
pursue under the chairmanship of Greece. We wish
Greece every success in conducting the affairs of the
OSCE in the coming months.

What I have to say in no way belittles the
importance and value of the briefing just made by the
Foreign Minister of Greece. However, I would like to
put on the record that this is the second time that we
have heard a representative of the OSCE in an official
meeting in the course of four months.

The OSCE, as we all know, is a regional
arrangement under Chapter VIII of the Charter of the
United Nations, as mentioned by the Minister. In that
respect, it is no different from a number of other
regional organizations. Yet in the course of this month
the Council refused to respond to requests by two other
regional organizations, the League of Arab States and
the African Union, to make their voices heard before
the Council. After prolonged discussion, and after
insistence by some members of the Council, we were
able to hear representatives of those two organizations
in informal meetings, of which no record exists.

My delegation - and I believe that my
colleagues from Burkina Faso and Uganda share this
View - would therefore like to put on record our hope
that the Council's double standard in dealing with
regional organizations will come to an end. We also
hope that in the future the Council will be prepared to
hear all regional organizations in official meetings -
in particular those organizations that are inextricably
linked with the United Nations in the field of the
maintenance of international peace and security, such
as the African Union.
