Mr. Ikouebe (Congo) (spoke in French): I waited
to hear the outcome before asking to speak, because
my delegation is not accustomed to explain its vote
here, particularly when it is a positive vote. But after
what has just taken place, I cannot fail to convey to the
Council how troubled my delegation is and to express
my deep disappointment.

If this is the response of this Council to the
crimes that have just been committed, then it clearly
constitutes an insult to the memory of the victims. If
we are not able to make a clear statement on such a
serious situation - which is repeated regularly and
with complete impunity - it will subsequently be very
difficult to try to include delegations like my own in
decision-making here, which is often contentious and
unilateral, on issues that are sometimes less worrying
and less urgent for the international community.
