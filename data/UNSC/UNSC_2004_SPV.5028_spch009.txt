Mr. Denisov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Yesterday during the Council's discussion of
the draft resolution on the situation in Lebanon
proposed by our United States and French colleagues,
we said that from our point of view its main purpose
was to prevent further escalation of tension in the
Middle East. We note that a high level of attention is
being devoted to the situation in Lebanon. Any misstep
could possibly exacerbate the situation in the region
and lead to the emergence of a new pocket of
instability in addition to the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian
conflict and the situation in Iraq. There is also a danger
of upsetting the fragile political balance in Lebanon
itself.

Guided by those thoughts, we submitted for the
Council's consideration the amendments with which
members are familiar. Their purpose was to situate the
draft resolution more in the context of an overall
Middle East settlement and to prevent it from being
one-sided and from concentrating solely on domestic
Lebanese affairs. We believe that Russia's proposals
improved the draft resolution submitted by France and
the United States by making it more acceptable to all
members of the Council.

Unfortunately, our proposals were not adopted.
Therefore, we were unable to support the draft
resolution.
