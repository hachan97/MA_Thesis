Ms. Paik Ji-ah (Republic ofKorea): The Republic of
Korea is deeply concerned over the continuing tensions
in eastern Ukraine. Despite the agreement reached in
Geneva on 17 April, the situation in Ukraine is showing
no signs of abating. We are troubled in particular by
the continuing violence and aggressive provocations
by illegal armed groups, including the seizure of key
public buildings and the recent assassination attempt
against the Mayor of the eastern city of Kharkiv.

All provocative actions and hostile rhetoric aimed
at destabilizing Ukraine must cease immediately.
As agreed in the Geneva statement, all illegal armed
groups must be disarmed and all illegally seized key
public buildings vacated.

We strongly condemn the detention of military
monitors of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as well as of Ukrainian
staff by illegal armed groups. It should be noted that
the OSCE monitoring mechanism is an indispensable
tool for implementing the Geneva statement. It is
unacceptable to target international observers who
are working to de-escalate the volatile situation. They
must be released immediately and unconditionally. The
safety and security of all international personnel must
be fully guaranteed by all actors on the ground.

In the light of the ongoing situation in Ukraine, we
reiterate that constructive dialogue among all concerned
parties will be the only way to achieve a peaceful
solution. In that regard, we call for all parties to the
Geneva statement to implement their commitments.
As Ukraine moves towards critical elections in May,
it is all the more important to ensure the holding of
fair and free elections in the country, without any
intervention or influence by outside forces. We hope
that the Ukrainian Government will lead an inclusive
and transparent constitutional process.

We once again reaffirm our full support for
Ukraine's sovereignty, independence and territorial
integrity.
