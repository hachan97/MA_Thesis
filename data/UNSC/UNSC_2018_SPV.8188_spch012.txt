Mr. Ndong Mba (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in Spanish): Following the unanimous adoption of
resolution 2401 (2018), I take the floor on behalf of the
Republic of Equatorial Guinea, whose Government
closely followed the whole process leading up to its
successful conclusion with the unanimous adoption of
this humanitarian resolution.

At the outset, I pay a well-deserved tribute to the
penholders, Kuwait and Sweden, for all their efforts,
patience and dedication to the goal of drafting a
resolution that was ultimately deserving of a favourable
vote. We commend the unanimous support of the elected
members for the penholders throughout the duration of
that process.

In Spanish, it is often said that "it is never too
late if the outcome is good". This positive outcome
is the result of the contributions of all members of
the Council, to which we extend our gratitude and
commend for the fruitful end. What lies ahead now
is the effective implementation of the provisions of
the resolution with a view to achieving the objective
the Security Council has set out to achieve, namely,
an immediate ceasefire throughout Syria in order to
facilitate the safe, unhindered and sustainable delivery
of humanitarian aid, services and medical evacuations
of all severely injured and ill persons. The Republic of
Equatorial Guinea energetically calls on all parties, the
United Nations and those involved in the devastating
conflict to do everything possible towards the noble
end of saving human lives and alleviating the suffering
that has been endured far too long by the people.
The adoption of the resolution partially spares all
members of the Security Council from embarrassment.
We will save ourselves completely from that shame if
the ceasefire takes effect in the next few hours and if
humanitarian aid and medical care begin to reach the
affected persons over the upcoming days.
