Mr. Denisov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): First of all, I should like to thank
Mr. Kiganahe, Minister of Justice of Burundi, and the
Assistant Secretary-General for the briefings given
today. We thank also the members of the Secretariat
assessment mission to Burundi, headed by
Mr. Kalomoh, Assistant Secretary-General, for the very
substantive and detailed report, whose
recommendations and proposals deserve further study.
We believe that the most important recommendations
are supported by the Secretary-General in his letter of
11 March. Further study of the report is necessary in
order to take the necessary well-thought-out decisions
and to step up efforts by the international community
to establish the truth, avoid partiality and bring about
justice in Burundi.

Our delegation believes that the mission's
recommendation to establish two bodies, which was
discussed in detail and commented upon by both
speakers - that is, the recommendation to set up a
mixed-composition truth commission and a special
chamber in the court system of Burundi - requires a
political and legal analysis that takes account of the
position of the Government of Burundi and of all
interested parties and political forces in that country.
