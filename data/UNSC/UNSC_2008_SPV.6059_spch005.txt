Mr. Renie (France) (spoke in French): First of
all, I would like to welcome the presence at this
meeting of the Security Council of the Iraqi Minister
for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Hoshyar Zebari.

France is gratified by the adoption of the
resolution that we have just adopted, which marks a
new stage in the return to full sovereignty for Iraq and
which, in particular, marks here the end of the mandate
of the multinational force in Iraq. France, which is
devoted to the unity, sovereignty and integrity of a
democratic Iraq, will continue to support the efforts of
the Iraqi Government, together with all of the actors
involved, to take all necessary measures to demonstrate
that Iraq has become a State like any other. We shall
spare no efforts to assist Iraqis in building their joint
future and in promoting national reconciliation so that
they might restore the peace and security to which they
have a right within the framework of a united State,
rich in its diversity.
