Mr. Kamara (Sierra Leone): Allow me to express
our thanks and appreciation to you, Sir, for organizing
this meeting on the situation in Sierra Leone, and to
the Council for its support for our peacebuilding efforts
and democratic consolidation. In particular, I commend
the Council's timely presidential statement and would
like to reaffirm my Government's commitment to

the consolidation of peace and democracy, as well as
the development of Sierra Leone, which we hope will
translate into visible improvement in the lives of the
people of Sierra Leone.

To that end, the Government has expressed
its willingness to work with all Sierra Leoneans,
irrespective of their political affiliation. Immediately
after being sworn in for his second term, President
Koroma immediately called on all Sierra Leoneans
to put politics behind them and to come together to
build Sierra Leone. We look forward to working with
all partners, including the Peacebuilding Commission,
in securing the gains already made, as well as in
moving into a more development-oriented phase of
peacebuilding.
