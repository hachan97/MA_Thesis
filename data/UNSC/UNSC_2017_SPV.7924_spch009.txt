Mr. Kawamura (Japan): Japan welcomes the
unanimous adoption of resolution 2350 (2017). We
thank the United States for taking a leading role in the
negotiations. Japan voted in favour of the resolution
based on the clear progress achieved in Haiti.
The Council has a responsibility to adopt mission
configurations that match the situation on the ground.
The time is right for a responsible transfer of tasks to
the United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti
(MINUJUSTH) and the United Nations country team.

The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti
(MINUSTAH) has significantly contributed to the
stabilization of the country over the past 13 years, and
we commend the men and women who have served
there. Haiti has demonstrated ownership of the electoral
process. We are also pleased by improvements in the
capacity of the Haitian National Police; however, there
is still more to do, including with respect to further
strengthening its capacity and the rule of law.

With that in mind we have given MINUJUSTH a
clear and focused mandate in a planned two-year time
frame. We believe this new Mission, together with
Haitian ownership, will help to further consolidate
the gains achieved by MINUSTAH. The people of
Haiti will continue to be Japan's first priority. We will
continue to support the consolidation of stability and
development in the country going forward.
