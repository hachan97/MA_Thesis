Mrs. Haley (United States of America): I would
like to thank you, Mr. President, for making this a public
meeting and enabling all of us to voice our concerns.

I would first like to tell my Russian friends that
not only has the Secretary-General said that the launch
was an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), and
the United States has said it was an ICBM, North Korea
itself has said that it was an ICBM. If Russia is in need
of any intelligence showing that the rest of the world
sees it as an ICBM, I am happy to provide it.

Secondly, with regard to being opposed to sanctions

on North Korea, the entire Security Council knows that
we have repeatedly adopted resolutions after which
nothing has happened. If members are happy with
North Korea's actions, they should veto those sanctions.
If they want to be North Korea's friend, they should
veto it. But if they see this as a threat and for what it
is - North Korea showing its muscle - they should
stand strong and vote with the international community
to strengthen sanctions on North Korea. If they choose
not to, we will go our own path.

But it makes no sense not to join together on this
threat from North Korea. That country has had no
care for Russia or China in this. It has not listened
to anything that they have said, and it is not going to
listen to anything that they say. So it is time that we all
stood together and said that we will not put up with this
action. Anyone who sits there and opposes sanctions,
or goes in defiance of a new resolution, is holding the
hands of Kim Jong-un.
