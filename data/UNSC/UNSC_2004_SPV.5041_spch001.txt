of the African Union; His Excellency Mr. Javier
Solana, High Representative for the European Union's
Common Foreign and Security Policy; and His

League of Arab States.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

I should like to draw members' attention to

agenda item, "Civilian aspects of conflict management
and peace-building".

I now give the floor to the Secretary-General.
