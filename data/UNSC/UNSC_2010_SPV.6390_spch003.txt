The President: I thank the Secretary-General for
his statement.

Before giving the floor to members of the
Council, I should like to recognize the achievements of
the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267
(1999) concerning Al-Qaida and the Taliban and
Associated Individuals and Entities in recent years,
under the able chairmanship of Austria, and the
valuable contributions of the Monitoring Team,
including the successful conduct of the review of the
consolidated list.

I now invite His Excellency Mr. Michael
Spindelegger, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the
Republic of Austria, to take the floor.
