The President (spoke in French): I thank the
Permanent Representative of Rwanda for his kind
words addressed to me.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

Before adjourning the meeting, I would like to
thank, on behalf of Council members, President
Robinson, President Byron, Prosecutor Brammertz and
Prosecutor Jallow for their presentations to the
Council.

The meeting rose at 1.30pm.
