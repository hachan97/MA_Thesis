Mr. Van Oosterom (Netherlands): On 21 December
last year, the parties to the conflict in South Sudan
agreed on a cessation of hostilities. The Kingdom of
the Netherlands welcomed it as a positive step towards
a political solution. But it was just days, perhaps even
hours, before the fighting resumed. Once again we saw
the leaders of South Sudan choose war over peace,
despite calls by the Security Council, the region, civil
society organizations and, most important, the people
of South Sudan.

Choosing war over peace must stop. That is why
we voted in favour of resolution 2418 (2018). Today the
Council sent a strong message to all parties in South
Sudan, stressing that there is an urgent need for a full
commitment to the cessation of hostilities, an urgent
need for a full commitment to a political agreement
and an urgent need for a full commitment to the well-
being of the people of South Sudan. If the parties
in South Sudan continue to behave solely based on
their narrow self-interests, the Council will consider
serious consequences.

We regret that the unanimous adoption of the
resolution was not possible. We believe that it would
have been possible had the Council been granted
additional time for full engagement through closer
cooperation with the region.

The resolution has now been adopted. We thank
the Intergovernmental Authority on Development
for its continuous leadership, and we join it in urging
all parties to the High-Level Revitalization Forum to
negotiate in good faith and make real compromises. It
is now up to the leaders of South Sudan to show that
they are serious about peace, about finding a political
solution and about the well-being of the people of
South Sudan.
