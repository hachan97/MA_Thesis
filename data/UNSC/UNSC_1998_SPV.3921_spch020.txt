Mr. Ghalib (Afghanistan): What we heard from the
Pakistani delegation is nothing but a commitment to the
pursuit of a policy of intervention and hegemony based
on Pakistan's attitude of blatancy and impunity towards
Afghanistan. Taking into account the fact that in the
international community there is no longer any kind of
ambiguity over the situation in Afghanistan -
particularly in the wake of the recent developments in
Afghanistan which have fairly framed Pakistan's
manifested military involvement in Afghanistan one way
or another - my delegation will refrain from further
explanations.

It will suffice to say that some of the elements killed
in the recent United States missile strikes on the terrorist
camps in eastern Afghanistan have been identified by
both intelligence sources and the world news media as
Pakistani nationals, either plain-clothes army officers of
the Pakistani Government or members of the
organizations based in Pakistan evidently engaged in
terrorist activities worldwide. With all this in mind, it
comes as no surprise to any of us why Pakistan continues

 

to preach that the international community should accord States in their belief that only an immediate halt to the

recognition to their mercenaries in Afghanistan, the Taliban. Pakistani interventions in Afghanistan, and thereby the

establishment of a broad-based, fully representative

My delegation cannot conclude without associating Government in the country, will lead to an early return of
itself with the common views expressed by the Member lasting peace and civility to Afghanistan.
