The President (interpretation from French): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on the agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

I shall make the following statement on behalf of the
members of the Security Council:

Fifty years ago, Europe saw the end of a war that
afflicted the entire planet. It was primarily to preserve
future generations from this scourge that the United Nations
was created. The Security Council was given a
special role in that effort, in that the Charter of the United
Nations entrusts it with the principal responsibility for
maintaining international peace and security.

For this reason, it seems appropriate for the Security
Council to pay tribute on this anniversary to all the
victims of the Second World War and to recall the
Council's firm desire to make every possible effort to
help mitigate the human suffering that results from war.

I invite the members of the Council to observe a
minute of silence in honour of the memory of the
combatants and victims of the Second World War.

The members of the Council observed a minute of
silence.

The President (interpretation from French): The
Security Council has thus concluded its consideration of

the item on the agenda.

The meeting rose at 10.55 a.m.
