Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
Chinese delegation voted In favour of resolution 2146
(2014), just adopted by the Council.

China is deeply concerned about the illegal export
of Libyan oil. We support the efforts of the Libyan
Government in safeguarding and maintaining national
economic sovereignty and we hope that resolution 2146
(2014) will contribute to the fight against the illicit
export of Libyan oil.

China calls on all parties in Libya to put the
interests of their country and people first; maintain
unity; safeguard national sovereignty, unity and
territorial integrity together; and appropriately resolve
issues arising in the process of political transition
and economic reconstruction through dialogue and
consultation.

Resolution 2146 (2014) clearly provides that it
should not be considered as establishing customary
international law and that measures adopted by Member
States under the authorization of that resolution shall not
affect the exclusive jurisdiction of a flag State over its
vessels on the high seas. It further stipulates that, when
adopting inspection measures, Member States should
first seek the consent ofthe vessel's flag State. We hope
that Member States will fully and accurately implement
resolution 2146 (2014), abide by the principles of
international law and protect the legitimate rights and
interests of flag States.
