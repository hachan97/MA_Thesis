Ms. Willson (United States of America): The
allegations that we have heard this afternoon
concerning the case of Luis Posada Carriles and the
five Cubans convicted of spying in the United States
are not new. In almost every recent Security Council
debate on counter-terrorism, those cases have been
raised. They were raised today and they were raised
less than a month ago, during the Council's debate on
12 November on the work of its counter-terrorism
committees. At that time, the United States gave a
detailed description of the background and legal steps
that had been taken by the Government of the United
States with regard to those cases. Rather than repeat
that discussion, I refer interested delegations to the
verbatim record of the 12 November response, which is
available in document S/PV.6015.
