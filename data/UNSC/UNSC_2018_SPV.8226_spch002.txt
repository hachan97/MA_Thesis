Ms. Tachco (United States of America): Today's
resolution 2410 (2018), renewing the mandate of the
United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti
(MINUJUSTH) for another year, is about Haiti. It is
about the continuing progress the country has made
towards security and stability. It is about adapting
the United Nations peacekeeping mission there to the
political and security situation on the ground. It is
about helping Haiti to develop the capacity to take the
lead in providing its own security and strengthening its
own institutions.

While some members of the Council may have tried
to sow confusion about what is standard peacekeeping
language in a Security Council mandate, the fact
remains that we are here today in support of Haiti
and of MINUJUSTH. Time and again, the Council
has expressed its support for equipping peacekeeping
missions with what is needed to protect civilians
around the world, and today is no different. With this
resolution, the Council reaffirms its support for the
Government of Haiti, for MINUJUSTH and for their
close cooperation with the United Nations country team
and all of the United Nations agencies working to build
a stronger Haiti. This will be key as MINUJUSTH to
transition to a non-peacekeeping presence in October
of 2019.
