The President (spoke in French): I thank the
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Spain for her kind
words addressed to my country and to Africa, as well
as for her encouragement.

I now call on The Right Honourable Jack Straw,
MP, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth
Affairs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland.
