The President: In accordance with rule 39 of
the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite
the following briefers to participate in this meeting:
Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, Under-Secretary-General for
Political Affairs; Ambassador Ertugrul Apakan,
Chief Monitor of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission to
Ukraine; and Mr. Stephen O'Brien, Under-Secretary-
General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency
Relief Coordinator.

On behalf of the Council, I welcome
Ambassador Apakan, who is joining today's meeting
via video teleconference from Kyiv.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

Two days ago, the Security Council discussed the
deterioration of the situation in eastern Ukraine and
succeeded in adopting a press statement (SC/12700) on
the subject. It became the first document of the Council
on the situation in and around Ukraine in almost
two years.

Unfortunately, despite the Council's call for an
immediate return to a ceasefire regime, the situation
in Avdiivka and other areas of eastern Ukraine remains
tense, with strong signs ofa possible further escalation.
Therefore, today's discussion is meant to contribute
to the settlement of the conflict. If we find common
ground, I suggest we consider the possibility of
adopting a draft presidential statement. If the Council
agrees with such a proposal, in the coming days we may
embark upon drafting it to reflect the main elements of
this briefing.

I now give the floor to Mr. Feltman.
