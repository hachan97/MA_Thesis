The President (spoke in Russian): I thank
Ambassador Traore for his kind words addressed to all
of us and our colleagues in the Secretariat.

Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.

Protection of civilians in armed conflict

The President (spoke in Russian): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Kenzo Oshima, Under-Secretary-
General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency
Relief Coordinator.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Oshima to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

I wish to recall document S/2002/1300, dated 26
November 2002, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the protection of civilians in
armed conflict.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Kenzo Oshima, Under-Secretary-
General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency
Relief Coordinator. It is my understanding that today,
Mr. Oshima, too, is speaking to us in this Chamber for
the last time, although we may meet him in other
contexts. We all know that Mr. Oshima is ending his
work at the United Nations. On behalf of the members
of the Council, I wish to express our deep appreciation
for the efforts he has made in his important post in
conditions of growing need for humanitarian assistance
throughout the world and for the fact that he has
demonstrated great diplomatic skills, a deep sense of
humanity and patience, and the ability to meet complex
challenges.

I now give the floor to Mr. Oshima.
