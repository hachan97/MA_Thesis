Mr. Mahbubani (Singapore): Today's event
reminds me of a similar one in January 2001, when we
saw the departure of another Security Council
superstar, named Richard Holbrooke. I remember that
at that meeting it was, I think, Ambassador Levitte who
tabled a resolution calling on the Security Council to
persuade the United States to delay the departure of
Ambassador Holbrooke. Unfortunately, Ambassador
Holbrooke exercised his veto and the resolution was
not carried. This is why I regret that France too has a
veto in this Council, for otherwise we would take the
lead in tabling a resolution calling on the Government
of France to delay the posting of Ambassador Levitte
from here.

Ambassador Levitte, as we all know, has become
a truly indispensable member of, as he said, our family,
and he has demonstrated tremendous leadership ability.
I, for one, will never forget what J ean-David did on our
trips on the Great Lakes mission. I thought there were
only twenty-four hours in a day, but under Jean-David,
we worked twenty-eight hours a day - morning, day
and night.

As Ambassador Levitte said, the most crucial
issues we face now are the Middle East and Iraq, and
on both we can say that Ambassador Levitte has shown
great leadership. I see that The New York Times Week
in Review section has finally recognized his
contribution by giving him a series of photographs that

I think may earn him a distinction as being the only
Ambassador who has been profiled in that way. It is a
well deserved profile. We wish him all the best in his
assignment. As he said in his own words just now, this
is "au revoir" and "a bientot".
