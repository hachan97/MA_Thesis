The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/779, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by China, France, the
Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of
America. Members of the Council also have before
them document 5/2008/744, which contains the report
of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
operation in Cyprus.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.

I should like to inform the Council that the

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
