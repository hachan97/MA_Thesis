Mr. Moraes Cabral (Portugal): Today's
resolution reaffirms the strong commitment of the
international community to pursue its assistance to
Liberia in its remarkable efforts towards peace and
democracy. The United Nations Mission in Liberia
(UNMIL) has played and will continue to play a
central role in the process of addressing remaining
challenges and capacity gaps, especially in the security
sector, which is vital for a successful transition.

We also believe that the upcoming elections will
constitute a great challenge and a crucial milestone for
Liberia, and that, as mentioned earlier this week by
Special Representative of the Secretary-General Ellen
Loj, it will also have a strong impact on the various
dimensions of the transition.

As in every scenario where the United Nations
has a presence, it is the Security Council's duty to
carefully monitor the evolution of the situation in order
to ensure that the objectives and means available
reflect both the reality on the ground and the evolving
priorities of national authorities. That is why we think
that today's resolution and our collective action in
Liberia would have benefited from an explicit
commitment on the part of the Council to hold new
consultations on UNMIL in May 2012, based on the
11-50062
outcome of the technical assessment mission scheduled
for early next year, and we hope that we will be able to
work within that time frame. Indeed, we believe that
we must preserve our capacity to act swiftly and to
adapt, if necessary, to new circumstances in Liberia.
