Mr. Cabral (Guinea-Bissau) (interpretation from French): We have great respect for the delegations
represented here and great consideration for the positions
they express here.

I do not think it would serve the purpose we are
trying to achieve here to allow our Afghan friends and
our colleague from Pakistan to engage in an exchange of
views that could only exacerbate the debate and could
divert us from the task we have set ourselves here:
working towards peace in Afghanistan through dialogue.
Let me therefore appeal to the Acting Minister for
Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan and to my colleague Mr.
Kamal to give up their debate, however, useful it may be,
so that we can find our way by using the points we have
already heard, which seem sufficiently clear for us to
fashion the elements to be contained in the draft statement
we intend to submit to the members of the Council for
approval.
