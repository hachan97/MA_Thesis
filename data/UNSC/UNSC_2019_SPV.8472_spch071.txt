Mr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): It was
not my intention to speak again, given the late hour. We
have heard various positions, including Mr. Arreaza's
account of events, which we dispute substantively.
But we do agree that all the Latin American countries
represented here, as well as many others, have come
out clearly against any use of force. I agree with him on
that. However, we have asked to speak because, among
the many issues he raised in his statement, he failed to
mention one factor that we believe to be essential.

One key element that has been referred to by many
speakers today is the exodus of Venezuelans that has
taken place over the past few years and which is the most
serious in the history of the region. I deeply regret that
he did not utter one single word of concern 4 not one
mea culpa 4 about the situation facing his compatriots
throughout the region. Some 3.4 million Venezuelan
citizens have fled the country; 700,00 of them are in
Peru. Lima is 4,300 kilometres from Caracas. Why
have 700,000 citizens come by land in very difficult
circumstances? They have done so because of the
economic disaster caused by the regime and because of
repression, but we believe that they also did so because
they had lost hope that one day things might change.
Unfortunately, the elections, which have been widely
discussed here, did nothing to give them such hope.

That was the reason for the establishment of the
Lima Group and its proposal for the use of political and
diplomatic means to put an end to the situation and to
re-establish democracy.
