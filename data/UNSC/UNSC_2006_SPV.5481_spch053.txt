Mr. Chidyavsiku (Zimbabwe): Madam
President, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to
address the Council on behalf of the African Group on
the topical subject of the situation in the Middle East,
including the Palestinian question. May I also
commend the delegations of Algeria, in its capacity as
Chair of the Group of Arab States, and of Qatar, for
their timely call for this debate to bring the urgent
attention and focus of the Council, and indeed the
larger international community, on the rapidly
deteriorating situation in the Middle East.

The Group of African States wishes to join others
in expressing its deep concern over the escalating
tensions in the Middle East, which have seen Israeli
military invasions of the Gaza Strip and the resulting
wanton destruction of Government buildings, roads,
bridges and power stations, the illegal arrest of elected
representatives and threats to the lives of defenceless
Palestinian civilians, including women and children.

The Group of African States sees this unfortunate
development as a result of the lack of progress in
addressing the major issues and in following up on
core positions regarding the question of Palestine. The
African Group condemns the ongoing excessive use of
military might by Israel, which is disproportionate to
the issues at hand, and demands that Israel immediately
cease all violations of international law, including
international humanitarian and human rights law.

The African Group wishes to call on the Security
Council to take urgent measures to bring the ongoing
Israeli military invasion to an immediate halt in order
to advance the peace process in the region.
