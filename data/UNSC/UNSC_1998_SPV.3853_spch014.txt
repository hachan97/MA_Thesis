Mr. Gomersall (United Kingdom) (interpretation from French): My delegation welcomes your presence
here, Mr. President, and the effective and amicable
presidency your delegation is sure to provide this month.

The United Kingdom would first like to commend
the great efforts of President Bongo of Gabon, as
Chairman of the International Mediation Committee, to
achieve lasting peace in the Central African Republic.

 

The United Kingdom pays tribute to the efforts of the
Inter-African Mission to Monitor the Implementation of the
Bangui Agreement (MISAB), which continues to play an
essential role in maintaining peace in the Central African
Republic. We also hail the efforts of the African troop-
contributing countries and the role played by France in its
logistical support of MISAB.

(spoke in English)

The United Kingdom notes the Secretary-General's
recommendation that a United Nations operation should
take over the role of MISAB subject to certain conditions
and his request that the Security Council should agree in
principle to this proposal. The United Kingdom will
certainly give this request its positive consideration.

We also support the Secretary-General's
recommendation that the deployment of a United Nations
operation should be made conditional on the Government
of the Central African Republic addressing the need for
fundamental adjustments in its social, economic, financial
and security policies. We welcome the Secretary-General's
intention to establish a United Nations political office in
Bangui to monitor the Republic's progress in the
implementation of these reforms.

For these reasons, my delegation will vote in favour
of the draft resolution before us.
