The President (spoke in Spanish): There are no
further speakers inscribed on my list. The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

I cannot conclude without thanking the
Secretariat, whose staff members tirelessly provided
water and other essential logistical support, as well as
the interpreters, without whom the Security Council
would be a Tower of Babel.

The meeting rose at 5.35 p.m.
