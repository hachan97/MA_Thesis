Mr. Bourgel (Israel) (spoke in French): I should
like to offer a brief response to the statement made by
the representative of Iran.

I recall yet again that the Islamic Republic of
Iran is one of the greatest sponsors of international
terrorism. Iran exports its missiles, promotes terrorism
and broadly disseminates its destructive ideology, in
Violation of resolutions 1559 (2004), 1701 (2006) and
2216 (2015). Be it in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen or
the Gulf, the Iranian regime acts under the same modus
operandi, in full impunity, with a View to destabilizing
the region and exporting its revolution. Moreover,
the Islamic Republic of Iran is seeking to turn Syria
into a platform for launching attacks on Israel. The
deployment of Iranian armed forces to Syrian territory
poses a grave threat to regional and international
security. The Security Council must firmly condemn
Iranian violations and take all useful measures to
end them.

On 1 September, barely a few days after the
renewal of the mandate of the United Nations Interim
Force in Lebanon, Hizbullah launched several anti-tank
missiles from southern Lebanon at targets in Israeli
territory. Israel has regularly warned the international
community against the efforts of Iran and Hizbullah to
strengthen the latter's arsenal, in flagrant violation of
the relevant Security Council resolutions, especially
resolutions 1559 (2004) and 1701 (2006). Hizbullah's
precision-guided missile programme is the most
alarming manifestation of that strategy.

The international community must take all
measures necessary against those who continue to fuel
violence and to promote terrorism with the sole aim of
undermining peace and security.

The meeting rose at 5.20 p.m.
