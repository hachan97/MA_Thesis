Ms. Power (United States of America): I do not
want to take much time here, but I am struck by the
number of factual claims that have been made by the
Ambassador from Syria that impugn the reputation
of the United Nations and the brave humanitarians
who are trying to get food to people who are being
starved - to death, in many cases. I think there is
some irony in a Government that pulls infant formula,
anaesthetics and surgical equipment off of convoys
and that does not even deign to respond to successive
United Nations requests, accusing the United Nations
of not showing up with convoys when there are people
starving. But, I am not the authority on this matter; the
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is.
As such, I would like to ask Under-Secretary-General
O'Brien to respond to some of the allegations made by
the Syrian ambassador.
