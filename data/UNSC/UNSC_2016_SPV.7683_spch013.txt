Mr. Yoshikawa (Japan): I should like to begin
by thank the three briefers - Assistant Secretary-
General Zerihoun, Ambassador Apakan and my former
colleague, Ambassador Martin Sajdik - for their
insightful and sobering briefings.

Japan is deeply concerned by the current situation
in Ukraine. The briefings we have just heard confirm
our concern. Ukraine may not make headlines these
days, but the situation is far from calm and stable. The
number of ceasefire violations in Donetsk and Luhansk
has been on an upward trend since January. During
the week of 11-17 April, nearly 1,000 rounds of mortar
fire were recorded - the highest number this year. In
March, 20 Ukrainian soldiers were killed. This was the
highest number of casualties since August 2015.

We must challenge this deadlock. The answer lies
in the Minsk agreements. That document has been
agreed to and signed by all the relevant parties. It was
also endorsed by resolution 2202 (2015). Japan once
again urges all parties to fully and promptly implement
the Minsk agreements.
It is a matter of concern that the freedom of
movement of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission
is increasingly restricted. The Special Monitoring
Mission has been playing a pivotal role in helping
to de-escalate the crisis. Without such restrictions,
the Mission could do much more. Japan stresses that
the Special Monitoring Mission must be given full
and unfettered access throughout the conflict zone,
including the entire border region.

Japan strongly believes that the conflict in Ukraine
can be solved only by diplomatic means and in full
respect for international law, especially the legal
obligation to respect Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial
integrity and independence.

In closing, I wish to confirm that Japan, as Chair of
the Group of Seven Ukraine Support Group and as one
of the largest donors to Ukraine, remains committed to
supporting Ukraine's efforts for reform.
