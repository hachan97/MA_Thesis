The President: In accordance with rule 37 of
the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite
the representative of the Syrian Arab Republic to
participate in this meeting.

In accordance with rule 39 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure, I invite the following
briefers to participate in this meeting: Mr. Mark
Lowcock, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian
Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, and
Ms. Virginia Gamba, Special Representative of the
Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict.

The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members to
document S/2018/724, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the implementation of Security
Council resolutions 2139 (2014), 2165 (2014), 2191
(2014), 2258 (2015), 2332 (2016), 2393 (2017) and 2401
(2018).

On 9 July, we met in this Chamber for an open
debate on children in armed conflict (see S/PV.8305).
The consensus among the representatives of Member
States who spoke that day was clear - children in war
must be protected. That sentiment was mirrored in the
unprecedented support of States Members for resolution
2427 (2018). The time has come for the Security Council
to move from words to action. That is Why we suggested
that today's meeting on the humanitarian situation in
Syria focus on the effects of the humanitarian crisis
on children.

I now give the floor to Mr. Lowcock.
