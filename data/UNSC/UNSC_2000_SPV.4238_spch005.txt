The President: I hope that members will allow
me to say that many of us very much welcome the
increased involvement of the international financial
institutions in post-conflict peace-building. I am not
sure ifI can say that beyond my national capacity, but
many of us, I think, do.

I understand that you are talking today here also
on behalf of the International Monetary Fund. If that is
so, I warmly welcome it, because one voice from 19th
Street, Washington, is a very good first step towards
more coherence in the international development
architecture that I think everybody would welcome
here - I may again go beyond my national capacity; I
am not sure how often I can do this.

I hope everybody will agree that it would be a
good idea if I now give the floor to the Vice-Prime
Minister of Guinea-Bissau, His Excellency
Mr. Faustino Imbali.
