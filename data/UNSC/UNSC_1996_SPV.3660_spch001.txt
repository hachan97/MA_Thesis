The President (interpretation from Spanish): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Ethiopia, Sudan and Uganda, in
which they request to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity With the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives to
participate in the discussion, Without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Etefi'a
(Ethiopia) and Mr. Yassin (Sudan) took seats at the
Council table; Mr. Mukasa-Ssali (Uganda) took the
seat reserved for him at the side of the Council

Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

a technical correction in the English text of the draft
resolution. In the second line of subparagraph 1 (a) of the
