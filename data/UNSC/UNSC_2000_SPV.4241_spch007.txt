Mr. Cappagli (Argentina)(spoke in Spanish): I
wish at the outset to congratulate you, Mr. President,
and to express my appreciation to Mr. van Walsum for
his excellent leadership in November. I also wish to
thank the delegation of the United Kingdom for
preparing and introducing the draft resolution under
consideration.

We support the text of the draft resolution
contained in document S/2000/1149, which represents
the lowest common denominator for achieving
consensus. The text includes a series of new elements,
including the allocation of 600 million euros for the oil
industry to be used as a cash component. We believe
this measure will bring enormous benefit. Similarly, we
support the prompt implementation of the cash
component in all sectors.

With regard to the payment of Iraqi contributions,
referred to in paragraph 8 of the draft resolution, we
would have preferred to have reached an agreement on
its implementation.

Similarly, with regard to updating the approved
simplified listings, the electricity and housing sectors
have been included. We hope that the transportation
and telecommunications sectors will soon be included,
pursuant to the Secretary-General's recommendations.

We support the use of surplus funds designated
for the Compensation Committee for humanitarian
purposes and, specifically, for the most vulnerable
groups. This measure will enable the initiation of
concrete projects to help the sectors identified in the
Secretary-General's report.

Finally, the updating of the list established
according to resolution 1051 (1996) has been
scheduled. Thanks to that, we will be able to rely on
this necessary action before concluding phase IX.

We are convinced that the progress contained in
this draft resolution will be reflected in concrete
improvements in the humanitarian situation. Similarly,
we hope that they will contribute to achieving greater
cooperation in the implementation of the relevant
resolutions.
