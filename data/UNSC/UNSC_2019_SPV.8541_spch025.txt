Mr. Tanin: Before I answer the question, let me
thank all those members of the Council who expressed
their support for the work of the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo and its staff at this
difficult time. I really appreciate it.

Secondly, I would like to express my appreciation
for the presence of Under-Secretary-General De Serpa
Soares and the decision to request his participation,
which is very important from my point ofview because it
sets out the framework from which our status emanates.
It can be very helpful, not in this context but in others,
for all the members of the Security Council to look at
such issues as immunity and others that he discussed.

In relation to the question posed by the representative
of the Russian Federation, let me reiterate that while the
fact-finding process is ongoing, we will not comment
on the details of an ongoing investigation. That is
something I have to respect. However, I would like
to assure the representative of the Russian Federation
and the other members of the Council that this fact-
finding review or internal investigation - whatever
one chooses to call it - will be comprehensive and all-
encompassing.
