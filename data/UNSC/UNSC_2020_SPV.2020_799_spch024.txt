We thank the Indonesian presidency of the Security Council for organizing this debate, as well as the Secretary-General, former Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, representing, The Elders, and Ms. Sarah Cliffe, Director of the Center for International Cooperation at New York University, for their briefings. It is particularly timely that the Council take up this topic, especially as a robust and coordinated multilateral responses are required across the United Nations system and relevant specialized agencies, delivering on time and where needed most during the current global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We therefore believe that, alongside urgent responses to tackle the pandemic, it is essential to work towards peacebuilding and sustaining peace in areas at risk, to appropriately tackle emerging threats and preserve the gains made through years of international efforts and United Nations presence on the ground, as well as to lay the foundation for solid and comprehensive post-pandemic recovery, including preventing associated risks to international peace and security. In this way, together with the people-centred preventative approach adopted within the United Nations, we have come to better grasp the multidimensional complexity that such emerging threats entail, since the possible ripple effects of the pandemic as a catalyst for violence and instability in areas of high volatility are of great concern to the Council's work. Chile joined the Secretary-General's global ceasefire call last March, especially in the light of reports of the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations, above all on women and girls - because of both the prevalence of sexual and gender-based violence in situations of conflict of tension, and the crucial role played by women on the front lines of the pandemic as essential health workers. We therefore underscore the role of women in peace and security processes in addressing such new threats, and, moreover, almost 20 years on from the adoption of the resolution 1325 (2000), we continue to recognize the key role women play in sustaining peace through their participation in building resilient and cohesive societies. Let me reiterate, on behalf of my country, that one of the main requirements in mounting an adequate response to these new threats necessarily involves international solidarity, and, although we understand that peaceful conditions would be the ideal context in which to tackle a pandemic, we recognize that conditions on the ground often pose adverse challenge to solidarity. It is therefore vital to count on the commitment of all relevant actors to guarantee safe and secure access for the delivery of international assistance, with due regard to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. In conclusion, we would like to acknowledge in particular how, through discussions such as this and the resolution adopted last month, the Security Council is contributing to the most urgent efforts and interests of the Organization and its Member States. We hope that discussion will continue on the various aspects identified during this debate, as well as on lessons learned previously, to address the challenges pandemics pose on the ground, including to peacebuilding, and with regard to mandates for the maintenance of international peace and security.
