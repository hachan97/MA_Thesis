The President (spoke in French): Pursuant to the
invitation extended to him at the 5980th meeting, I
invite the representative of Chad to take a seat at the
Council table.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Allam-mi
(Chad) took a seat at the Council table.

The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/6I6, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Belgium, Costa Rica,
Croatia, France, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and the
United States of America.

Members of the Council also have before them
document 8/2008/601 and Addendum 1, which
contains the report of the Secretary-General on the
United Nations Mission in the Central African
Republic and Chad.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the
voting.
