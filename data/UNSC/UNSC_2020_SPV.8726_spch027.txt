Mr. Kyslytsya (Ukraine): The Russian delegation has just presented its account of the nature of the escalation in Donbas today. It was said that is due a provocation led by the armed forces of Ukraine. I want to draw the attention of the Security Council to a statement made today by the Spokesperson of the President of the Russian Federation, Mr. Dmitry Peskov, in relation to what happened. (spoke in Russian) "We do not have the details of this confrontation. We do not know what provoked it. Our hope is that, in the near future, it will be possible to shed light on the details of what occurred, before drawing any conclusions".(spoke in English) I now address a question to the Russian delegation: Should we listen the Spokesperson of the Russian President, or should we listen to the talking points written at Sixty-seventh Street in New York?
