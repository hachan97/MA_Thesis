Mr. Matjila (South Africa): South Africa would like to join colleagues in commending the United States of America and the Taliban for reaching this agreement. We would especially like to thank the State of Qatar for making its resources and time available for that meeting. I would like to make three points. First, indeed, one should make friends with one's enemies and make peace with them. Secondly, there is no substitute for negotiations and peaceful discussion and resolution. Thirdly, it is through the process that Afghanistan is to embark on now - a process among the Afghan parties themselves - that a homegrown, long-lasting solution will ultimately be forged. The Security Council needs to accompany that process towards a home-grown, intra-Afghan negotiation. All parties - the United States, Europe, Russia, China and neighbouring countries - should support that process, because in it lies a lasting solution for Afghanistan.
