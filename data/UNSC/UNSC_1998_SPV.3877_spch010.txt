Mr. Shen Guofang (China) (interpretation from Chinese): Since its establishment, the International Tribunal
for Rwanda has done quite a lot of work and has played a
certain positive role for the stabilization of the situation in
the Great Lakes region as well as that of Rwanda. China
fully understands the request of the Rwandan Government
and other concerned African countries that a third Trial
Chamber be established so as to expedite the trial of the
indicted. China hopes that this will help further stabilize the
situation in the region and promote the national
reconciliation process.

In view of the above, China will vote in favour of this
draft resolution and hopes that the International Tribunal
will take effective measures to enhance its efficiency. At
the same time, I wish to reiterate that China's position with
regard to the creation of international tribunals remains
unchanged. I also want to point out that the reference to
Chapter VII of the Charter in the draft resolution is only a
technical reaffirmation of the content of resolution 955
(1994) and does not constitute any precedent.
