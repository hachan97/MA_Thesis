The President: I want to repeat, since I am
sitting here in the Chair, that my understanding of what
we agreed yesterday did not include the question of
whether there would be a speakers' list or not. I say
this just for the record, as this is an on-the-record
discussion. We will continue discussion of this subject
later.

We will now turn to the business at hand.
