Mr. Gatilov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation has consistently
favoured the achievement of a just settlement of the
problem of Cyprus. We believe that that problem must
be resolved through the establishment of a single
bicommunal, bizonal federal State that ensures full
political equality for both communities inhabiting the
island, as provided for by the relevant Security Council
resolutions, particularly resolution 1250 (1999).

We support the efforts of the Secretary-General
and his Special Adviser on Cyprus within the
framework of the good offices mission. The outcome of
that mission was the "Annan plan", whose basic
parameters are balanced in nature. As stated in
resolution 1475 (2003), just adopted by the Security
Council, we call upon the parties to continue the
negotiating process to reach a peaceful settlement,
using the Annan plan's basic parameters as a basis for
dialogue. Taking into account the well-known concerns
of both sides regarding individual elements of the plan,
we believe that it will be possible to adjust it, which
would help in reaching compromise solutions. On that
basis, the Russian Federation supported Security
Council resolution 1475 (2003), on Cyprus.
