Mr. Elaraby (spoke in Arabic): I do not intend to
enter into an argument. However, the Ambassador of
Syria raised an issue that I feel compelled to clarify.

When you contacted me, Mr. President, you
mentioned that some members wanted General Al-Dabi
to attend this meeting. I said then that the Prime
Minister of Qatar and the Secretary-General of the
League of Arab States would attend at the request of
the Ministerial Council of the League of Arab States in
order to inform the Council about what had happened.
General Al-Dabi was not requested to appear before the
Council; his job is on the field and his report is before
the Council (S/2012/71, annex, enclosure 4).
