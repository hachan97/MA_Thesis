Mr. Singer Weisinger (Dominican Republic) (spoke in Spanish): For the Dominican Republic, the
United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti
(MINUJUSTH) will conclude at the same time that
elections are expected to be held in the country, a time
that always implies possible instabilities. We believe that
the timing and conditions need to be taken into account
when making way for any other post-MINUJUSTH
work of the United Nations. The task of the Security
Council is to ensure international peace and security
and to achieve a transition from MINUJUSTH in
accordance with the best interests of the Haitian people.
