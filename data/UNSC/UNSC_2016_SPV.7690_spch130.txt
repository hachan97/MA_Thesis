The President (spoke in Arabic): I propose that the
Council invite the Permanent Observer of the Observer
State of Palestine to the United Nations to participate in

this meeting, in accordance with the provisional rules
of procedure and the previous practice in that regard.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I now give the floor to the Permanent Observer of
the Observer State of Palestine to the United Nations.
