The President (spoke in Russian): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Edmond Mulet,
Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping
Operations.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Mulet to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/98, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the deployment of the African
Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Edmond Mulet, Assistant Secretary-
General for Peacekeeping Operations. I now give him
the floor.
