Mr. Mounzer (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): The Government of the Syrian Arab Republic
was the first to call for the return of all refugees to their
home country, Syria. The Syrian Government was the
first to constantly call for the return of all refugees to
their homes. Those who impede their return are not the
Syrian Government. Everybody knows who it is that
is impeding their return. We support the return of all
refugees to the Syrian Arab Republic.
