The President (spoke in French): I would
like to see a positive element in these limited but
non-scripted exchanges.

There are no more names inscribed on the list of
speakers no request for the floor. I now invite Council
members to informal consultations to continue our
discussion on the subject.

The meeting rose at 12.10p.rn.
