The President (interpretation from Spanish): Before
concluding the meeting I would like to thank the
interpreters and support staff who have been with us at
this late hour in our effort not to have a meeting this
afternoon, which I think we will all appreciate. Again,
thank you to all the staff who gave their time to enable us
to complete our meeting at this late hour.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.

The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 2 pm.
