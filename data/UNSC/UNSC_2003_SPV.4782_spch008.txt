Mrs. D'Achon (France) (spoke in French): The
Italian Presidency of the European Union will speak
later in the meeting on behalf of all of the Union's
members and other partners.

I would like to echo the President in warmly
thanking Mr. Michael Steiner for his final briefing to
the Council, which he made this morning. I also wish
to thank him for all his work as the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General for Kosovo.
We are certain that, thanks to his drive and his
determined leadership of the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), the
international community has made considerable
progress towards the goal of establishing a secure and
genuinely multi-ethnic, democratic and tolerant society
in Kosovo, thus making possible the full
implementation of the objectives of resolution 1244
(1999). The approach taken, and the procedure
developed by, Mr. Steiner to define norms and
benchmarks to be met by all actors in Kosovo merit
particular praise.

Very real results have been achieved, in particular
in the areas of establishing local Provisional
Institutions of Self-Government, the gradual transfer of
competencies to those institutions, respect for the rule
of law, freedom of movement and economic
development. All those results must be safeguarded,
and determined efforts must continue to be made. We
believe that the Provisional Institutions of Self-
Government have a very specific responsibility to
establish a climate conducive to implementing the
objectives of the international community for the
benefit of all of Kosovo's inhabitants.

Guaranteeing the rights of minorities and the
establishment of a direct dialogue between Pristina and
Belgrade on practical issues of mutual interest deserve
particular attention. It will only be in that way that the
transfer of non-reserved competencies will have a
lasting and positive impact and that, in what we hope
will be a calm environment, the issue of status can
really begin to be addressed.
