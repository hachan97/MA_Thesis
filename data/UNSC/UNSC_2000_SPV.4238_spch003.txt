The President: Mr. Secretary-General, that was a
very important and profound statement. Because I think
you touched upon all the important aspects of the case
we discussed today, also reminding us of some of the
lessons learned in earlier post-conflict situations, some
of which, you reminded us, still have to be
implemented, and it was important to draw our
attention to that.

I now welcome and call on Mr. Callisto Madavo.
