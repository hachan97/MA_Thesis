Mr. Le Roy (spoke in French): In order not to
prolong this debate, which has already been very
lengthy, I should just like to say a few words of
gratitude for the richness of the numerous statements
that have been made. Those interventions clearly
illustrate the sustained interest that exists with regard
to peacekeeping operations. This meeting has been
particularly useful for us in the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field
Support at a time when we are putting the finishing
touches on our New Horizon non-paper on
peacekeeping.

I can assure all the Member States that have
spoken today that we are going to do our best to cover
in our non-paper all the comments that have been made
today, especially those on the need to make full use of
existing instruments and the reforms that have already
been announced. We have also taken due note of the
references to resolution 1353 (2001), which clearly
emphasizes consultations with troop-contributing
countries. All of that will be reflected in our non-paper.

The last point that I wish to stress relates to an
issue that has been referred to several times. Clearly,
the non-paper is not an end in itself; on the contrary, it
is the beginning of a process of dialogue. In the next
two weeks, we will be putting forth the non-paper to
launch a discussion in various bodies, including of
course with the Security Council and the Special
Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, which has the
primary responsibility for this issue. Following
consultations with the various stakeholders, we will
issue a formal report for the next session of the General
Assembly.

I believe that Ms. Malcorra would also like to say
a few concluding words.
