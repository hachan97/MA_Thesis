Mr. Parham (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom has just voted in favour of resolution 2033
(2012) because we are convinced of the important role
that regional organizations can play in the pursuit of
peace and security in Africa and elsewhere. The United
Kingdom recognizes in particular the contribution that
the African Union is making to preventing and
managing conflict in Africa, and commends the
cooperation between the United Nations and the
African Union in that regard.

However, we do not believe that that cooperation,
however welcome in principle, should come at the
expense either of the Security Council's primacy in
respect of the maintenance of international peace and
security or of its practical capacity to respond speedily
and effectively to any threat to international peace and
security.

We regret that the hurried manner in which the
text of the resolution was negotiated has left in place
some potential ambiguities on those issues. I would
like therefore to clarify the United Kingdom's position.
In particular, the text refers in paragraph 6 to
coordination between the Security Council and the
African Union Peace and Security Council. In those
instances where we consider coordination to be
appropriate, it can occur only in the context of the
primacy of the Security Council regarding the
maintenance of international peace and security.
Effective cooperation between the United Nations and
regional organizations calls for an emphasis on timely
10
communication and consultation and the avoidance of
prescribed procedures that are inflexible in the face of
varied and urgent challenges.

The United Kingdom supports efforts further to
enhance relations between the Council and regional
and subregional organizations in accordance with the
Charter of the United Nations.
