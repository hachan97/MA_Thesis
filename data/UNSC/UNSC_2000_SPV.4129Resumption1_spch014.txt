The President: I would like to thank the
representative of Belgium for his very detailed presentation.
I am also grateful that the senior representative of the
Diamond High Council could also be with us today.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Bulgaria. I invite him to take a seat at the
Council table and to make his statement.
