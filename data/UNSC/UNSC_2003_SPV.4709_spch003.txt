The President: I thank the representative of
South Africa for his kind words addressed to me.

I would like to remind members of the Council
and speakers to kindly adhere to the seven minutes
allotted. Every additional minute or two adds up to
another hour of debate in the Council. In order to give
speakers the full use of their seven minutes, I would
propose that we consider that the Ambassador of South
Africa spoke on everyone's behalf in addressing kind
words to me. I would therefore suggest that all other
speakers refrain from addressing kind words to me.
Other kind words are fully welcome.

I now give the floor to the representative of Iraq.
