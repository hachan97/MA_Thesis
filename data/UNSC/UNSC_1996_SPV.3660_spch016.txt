Mr. Thiebaud (France) (interpretation from French):
The French delegation voted in favour of the draft
resolution submitted by several members of the Caucus of
Non-Aligned States.

France supports efforts to combat international
terrorism and, in particular, to shed light on the attempted
assassination of President Mubarak on 26 June 1995.

On 31 January last, the Security Council, in
resolution 1044 (1996), made several demands of the
Sudan. In his report of 11 March, the Secretary-General
reported that the Sudan had not fully met those demands.

The resolution just adopted is aimed mainly at
requiring that State to fulfil its obligations under
resolution 1044 (1996), and in particular to work to
extradite to Ethiopia the individuals suspected of having
participated in the attack and who are within its territory.

The text of the resolution must be understood in the
light of available information that leads us to suppose that
the three suspects are in the Sudan. In order to comply
with the resolution, Sudan is required to work towards the
extradition of these individuals if they are indeed within
its territory. To ask more of it would not be in accordance
with international law on extradition, nor is the resolution
intended to do so. The Council cannot hold Sudan
responsible for what it is not.

The Council has chosen not to impose on the Sudan
sanctions that would have a noticeable economic impact
on the population, which is among the most destitute in
Africa.

In two months' time, the Council will have to
consider, on the basis of facts established by the
Secretary-General, whether the Sudan has met the
demands made of it and, if it has not, whether it should
envisage the adoption of further measures. In this way,
the Security Council's ability to judge the situation is
retained.
