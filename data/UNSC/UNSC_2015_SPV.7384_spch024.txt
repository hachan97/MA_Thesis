Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I am glad to hear that the United States is
not going to prevent the implementation of the Minsk
agreements. With regard to the implementation of the
Minsk agreements and the statement about Russia
repeating certain previous arguments, we are not
pretending anything. We proposed a certain course
of action. No one listened to us. We warned about the
consequences. Sadly, those consequences are what they
have been. This has all been happening on our borders.
We made our choice, as set out in the Minsk agreements.
I hope that those agreements will be duly delivered on.

I hope that peace can be restored in Ukraine and that
there can be social consensus in the country- which has
not existed for a very long time now, not even before the
past year when the President was toppled. That is What
we need to work on, which Kyiv, for some reason, has
not wanted to do. For instance, one can see the disgust
over the new national holiday, which was declared
on the same date that they established collaboration
with the pro-Nazi army. They have said nothing about
setting up a new Constitution - a genuine pity. That is
what Russia had already warned about. Let us look at
the situation clearly and objectively.
