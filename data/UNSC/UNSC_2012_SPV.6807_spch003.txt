The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Mr. Martin for his briefing. Allow me to say that I
believe that I reflect the sentiment of Council members
in demonstrating our appreciation for his invaluable
contribution to Libya's reconstruction process and his
outstanding dedication in carrying out a task under
extreme difficulty and not without risks. I am certain
that the Government and the Libyan people fully
appreciate his support in this historic transition phase
of the country.

I now give the floor to the Permanent Representative
of Libya.
