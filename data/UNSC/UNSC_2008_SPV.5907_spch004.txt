Mr. Mantovani (Italy): We welcome the adoption
by consensus of this important resolution on an issue of
the greatest concern, related to counter-narcotics in
Afghanistan, thanks to the initiative of the French
delegation. We are confident that this step will give
political impetus to the fight against the illicit
trafficking in precursors in Afghanistan, in particular
through stricter implementation of existing obligations
under the relevant United Nations conventions. We are
pleased with this further demonstration of the cohesion
of the Council in addressing the situation in
Afghanistan. That cohesion is based on common
strategic interests that go beyond the issue under
consideration today.

It is also important that Afghanistan and the other
countries of the region were extensively consulted in
the preparation of this resolution. Every relevant actor
should feel comfortable with the content of the
resolution. Furthermore, we welcome the strong link
established in the text between this initiative and the
crucial role played by existing bodies and agencies. I
refer in particular to the Commission on Narcotic
Drugs of the Economic and Social Council; to the 1988
Vienna Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and its treaty body,
the International Narcotics Control Board; to the Paris
Pact; and to the United Nations Office on Drugs and
Crime. To achieve success in this field we need an
integrated approach within the United Nations system.

Finally, we hope that the adoption of this
resolution will galvanize the discussions on this issue
at tomorrow's Paris conference on Afghanistan.
Obviously, there will be many more crucial topics to be
discussed in Paris. We will soon propose for the
consideration of the Council further possible actions to
reflect and acknowledge the outcome of the
conference.
