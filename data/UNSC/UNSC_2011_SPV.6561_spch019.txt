Mr. Muburi-Muita: Thank you, Mr. President,
for the opportunity to take the floor once again. I do
not have much to respond to, but I wish to seize this
occasion to thank you personally, Mr. President, and
Council members for the very warm words expressed
to me personally and especially to my new Office.

Again, we are taking a very broad approach to
our work. As I mentioned earlier, we worked on a
multi-pronged approach in which the two Councils
play a primary role, as do the United Nations-African
Union Joint Task Force on Peace and Security, the
Secretariat and the Commission - all the way down to
the desk-to-desk meetings. One such meeting has just
been convened in Nairobi to bring together technical
staff of the African Union (AU) and United Nations.

With regard to the issue of the regional economic
communities, they play an important role in resolving
conflict situations on the continent of Africa. United
Nations agencies and the partners' group have also
been effective in marshalling efforts to enhance the
capacity of the AU to better address matters of peace
and security. So we are taking a multifaceted and very
deep approach in the new Office. As we continue to
establish ourselves, we look forward to having a more
prominent presence there on behalf of the United
Nations.

In conclusion, I hope to have another opportunity
in the future to present a more comprehensive report as
our Office grows.
