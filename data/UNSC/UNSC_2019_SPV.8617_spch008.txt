Mr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish):
1, too, would like to begin by warmly welcoming
Ambassador Kelly Craft, Permanent Representative of
the United States.

Peru voted in favour of resolution 2488 (2019)
because it reflects the Security Council's firm
commitment to the efforts of the authorities of the
Central African Republic to restore State authority and
bring about peace and national reconciliation. At the
same time, with resolution 2488 (2019), the Central
African authorities can also continue benefiting from
the arms embargo exemptions and receiving support
from its partners to strengthen the capacity of its
national defence and security forces.

The situation in the Central African Republic
remains fragile. The Council must remain united in
order to work with the Central African authorities and
the international community to ensure peacebuilding
and lasting stability in the country. Peru, which
has a large troop contingent in the United Nations
Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in
the Central African Republic, will continue actively
supporting that objective.
