Mr. Smirnov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): First of all, I would like to say how pleased
we are to see you, Sir, presiding over the Security
Council for this month. We are ready to cooperate
closely with your delegation. We greatly appreciate the
work done by the representative of Pakistan during the
month of May, and express our gratitude to him.

We thank Chairman Bryant and the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Klein, for
their very comprehensive briefings on the situation in
Liberia. We support the main conclusions of the most
recent report of the Secretary-General (S/2004/430).
We note that some progress has been made in
stabilizing the situation in Liberia. At the same time, a
number of important tasks remain on the agenda for a
Liberian settlement.

Chairman Bryant dealt in detail with the tasks
that need to be undertaken to ensure the effective and
transparent management of the national resources of
his country. We support the efforts of the National
Transitional Government in that regard. At the same
time, we believe that questions pertaining to the
security situation in the context of the disarmament and
reintegration process, as well as problems relating to
the extension of the authority of the Transitional
Government throughout the territory of the country,
remain priority tasks on the political agenda, in the
framework of the efforts of the Transitional
Government, including preparations for the elections
which are planned for 2005.
In that context, we would like to ask a number of
specific questions. We would like in particular to know
how the establishment of a new national army is being
dealt with. What elements are going to be included?
What will its approximate size be?

The report of the Secretary-General refers to the
illegal transportation of heavy weapons through the
territory of Liberia. How serious is that problem? We
would be grateful for more detailed information in that
regard.
