Mr. Voto-Bernales (Peru) (spoke in Spanish):
Peru decided to support this resolution because of its
commitment to the fight against impunity and its firm
position on combating terrorism and because it is of the
view that this resolution is the only way to overcome
the legislative impasse regarding the establishment of
the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, given the need to
ensure that justice prevails, which is essential in
promoting peace and security.

Peru has taken into account that the majority of
the Lebanese parliament has given ample proof of its
strong determination to approve the agreement
establishing a special tribunal to try the persons who
have been identified by the International Independent
Investigation Commission as the presumed perpetrators
of the politically motivated crimes executed by means
of terrorist acts. Therefore, we hope that the Lebanese
parliament can be convened so that it can complete the
internal constitutional process for adoption and
ratification within the time schedule envisaged in the
resolution we have just adopted.

In supporting this resolution, given the
exceptional political circumstances that exist, Peru
reaffirms its respect for and commitment to
international law. Thus, recognizing the particular
circumstances of the case, we believe that the
agreement signed between Lebanon and the United
Nations by means of a resolution, in exercise of the
powers of the Security Council as provided for in
Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, must
not constitute a precedent beyond this particular case.
