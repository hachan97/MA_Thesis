Sir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): The draft
resolution before us illuminates what really matters: the
ordinary people who are suffering so greatly in and
around Kosovo, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and the
people who are trying to look after them. The United
Kingdom agrees with those who want to see an early end
to the Kosovo crisis. That must come about in a way
which enables the citizens of Kosovo who have been
displaced from their homes and who have been put
through unimaginable horrors to return in safety and long-
term security. The Group of Eight proposals show how
that can be done. These are the basis on which to move
on from crisis to fulfilling the terms of this draft
resolution, in favour of which the United Kingdom will
vote. It deserves the support of all members of the
Security Council.
