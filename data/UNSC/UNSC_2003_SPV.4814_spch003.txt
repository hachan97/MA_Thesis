The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank the
Secretary-General for his important statement.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution (8/2003/581)
before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the
draft resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Guinea, Mexico, Pakistan,
Russian Federation, Spain, Syrian Arab Republic,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, United States of America

The President (spoke in Arabic): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1502 (2003).

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
