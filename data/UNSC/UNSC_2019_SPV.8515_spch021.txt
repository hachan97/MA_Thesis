The President: I would like to respond in my
national capacity.

The Ambassador of Syria accused members of the
Security Council of hypocrisy and a lack of concern for
the people. I would like to just say that, for Germany's
part, we have taken in hundreds of thousands of Syrians
in Germany - one of them is sitting right here. We talk
to the people and know of their fate. We hear them talk
about the torture that they experienced in prisons in
Syria. We know about people being starved, bombed
and gassed by their own Government, as well as being
sexually violated in their homes. I just wanted to
mention that.

I would also like to say that Germany is working
on accountability. We support the Impartial and
Independent Mechanism to Assist in the Investigation
and Prosecution of Persons Responsible for the Most
Serious Crimes under International Law Committed
in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011, and
we are now prosecuting the first representatives of
the Syrian regime in Germany for the atrocities they
have committed.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

I now give the floor to Ms. Mueller to respond
to questions.
