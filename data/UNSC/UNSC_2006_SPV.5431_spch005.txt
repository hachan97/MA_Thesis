Mr. Kitaoka (Japan): Japan voted in favour of,
and welcomes the adoption of, the resolution on
Western Sahara, which extends the mandate of the
United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara for another six months. Given the importance of
the role that the Secretary-General and his Personal
Envoy are playing in the search for a peaceful solution
to this issue, Japan welcomes their efforts and will
continue to support them.
