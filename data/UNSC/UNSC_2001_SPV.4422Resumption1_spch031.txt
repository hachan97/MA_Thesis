Mr. Otunnu: Given the late hour, my remarks
will be very brief. I thank you, Madam President, and
all the members of the Council for this debate. I have
taken note of the critique, the comments and the
proposals by members, and I shall do everything within
my power to act on them.

Secondly, I want to say that the mandate that has
been entrusted to me concerns the fate of children in all
situations of armed conflict.

Let me say, thirdly, that all of us, especially
within the international community, cannot
discriminate among children affected by armed
conflict, regardless of their geographic location or the
political circumstance in which they may be, which is
the reason why I said this morning that all the children
are waiting for the same thing - redemption songs.

I have also taken note of the tremendous desire
on the part of Council members to see the gap between
words and deeds narrowed, and I hope that the next
time we return to this debate in the Council there may
be some concrete, even if modest, steps, made to try to
bridge this gap.

Finally, I want to say that I have taken note of the
wish of the Council to see a particular focus on
Afghanistan. I shall be working very closely with
UNICEF and other colleagues within the United
Nations system and the leadership of Ambassador
Brahimi to make this indeed an example of a more
comprehensive and proactive response to the needs and
the rights of children.

Once again I thank the Council. I thank the
Council very much for allowing Alhaji Babah Sawaneh
to address the Council on this occasion. It has been a
historic day.
