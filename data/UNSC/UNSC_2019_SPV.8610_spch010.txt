Before adjourning this meeting, which is the last
scheduled meeting in the Chamber for the month of
August, let me express, on behalf of the Polish Mission,
our sincere appreciation and thanks to all the members
of the Security Council for their continued support and
cooperation during this very busy month. I also thank
the States Members of the United Nations for their
active participation in our meetings: they are always
with us.

I would like to thank all members of Council members'
teams, including the permanent representatives, deputy
permanent representatives and political coordinators
as well as the experts on the various issues we have
discussed for their hard work and dedication.
We thank Director Hasmik Egian, James Sutterlin,
who is with us today, and the professional Security
Council Affairs Division team for their assistance, as
well as the conference officers, interpreters, verbatim
reporters and security staff.

I also thank the members of my team for their work,
organization and dedication throughout our presidency.

I am grateful for their tireless efforts to fulfil this
delicate task in the most efficient way possible.

I am now pleased to turn over the gavel to the
Russian Federation and wish its team great success in
September, which l am sure they will achieve. We offer
them our full support and cooperation.
