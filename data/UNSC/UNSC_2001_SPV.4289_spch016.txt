Mr. Neewoor (Mauritius): My delegation
welcomes the Foreign Minister of the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia to the Security Council
Chamber, and thanks him for the briefing he has given
us. My delegation condemns the acts of violence in
northern Macedonia by Albanian extremists. We
appreciate the fact that the Government of Macedonia
has exercised great restraint in addressing the situation
resulting from the action of the Albanian extremists.
We have no doubt that the Kosovo Force and the
United Nations Interim Administration Mission in
Kosovo will provide full support to the Government of
Macedonia in addressing the situation.

Macedonia is an example of a stable, multi-ethnic
democracy and deserves the full support of the Security
Council for the proposals that the Minister presented to
manage the crisis imposed on it by the Albanian
militants. We assure the Minister of our total support,
and we endorse the presidential statement that will be
issued at the end of our meeting.
