Mr. Skoog (Sweden): I thank you, Mr. President,
and Bolivia for your efforts to raise the profile of
this important issue by putting mine action on the
Security Council's agenda. That has led to the adoption
today of resolution 2365 (2017) - the first on mine
action - which we welcome.

As we stated during the open debate on 13 June
(see S/PV.7966), the terrible legacy of landmines and
explosive remnants of war in the communities where
they are found cannot be overstated. Sweden fully
shares the concerns expressed regarding the serious
post-conflict humanitarian problems caused by
landmines and explosive remnants of war. It is essential
that we step up our efforts to minimize the occurrence,
effects and risks from that threat. Sweden underlines
the obligation of all States to respect, and ensure respect
for, international humanitarian law.

Sweden is a State party to all the relevant conventions
banning or regulating the use ofnon-controllable mines,
anti-personnel landmines, cluster munitions and the
handling of the explosive remnants of war. We believe
that the full implementation of those conventions is the
most effective means for countering the risks associated
with the use of such weapons.

We remain firmly committed to the international
frameworks put in place to end the scourge of the
explosive remnants of war. We will continue to work
for their full universalization and urge others to join us
in that endeavour.
