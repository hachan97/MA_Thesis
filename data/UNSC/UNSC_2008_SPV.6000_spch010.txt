Sir John Sawers (United Kingdom): Our thanks
go to President Guelleh for his very clear and
informative briefing. It is good to have the Foreign
Minister of Djibouti with us here as well. I am grateful
to Ambassador Desta of Eritrea for his statement.

I would like to begin by expressing my
Government's deep sympathy with the concerns raised
by President Guelleh. We understand the concern on
the Djibouti side at the action of Eritrea and the burden
that that has imposed on Djibouti owing to the need to
divert scarce resources to help defend its position. The
United Kingdom commends Djibouti for its
constructive response in recent months and for
cooperating with the Secretary-General's good offices.
We look to Eritrea to take an equally cooperative
approach.

We reiterate the Council's message set out in the
presidential statement of 12 June (S/PRST/2008/20),
which urged Eritrea, in particular, to withdraw its
forces to the status quo ante. It is deeply regrettable
that Eritrea rejected the Secretary-General's good
offices mission as carried out by Under-Secretary-
General Pascoe. Should Eritrea continue to block
international efforts to facilitate dialogue, determine

future arrangements for decreasing the military
presence and develop confidence-building measures,
the Security Council will need to consider what steps it
might take to break the impasse. We welcome the
planned action by our French colleagues in this regard.

The visit by African Union Chairman Jean Ping
to Eritrea is a positive step, and we hope that that will
prove to be a useful channel for making progress.

We urge both Djibouti and Eritrea to enter a
dialogue to resolve their dispute on the border
peacefully. We encourage the Secretary-General to
continue to use his good offices in an effort to foster a
dialogue between the two countries. We also encourage
those in the region to use their good relations with
either party in support of a peaceful resolution of this
unnecessary dispute.
