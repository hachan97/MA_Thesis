Mr. Osorio (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): The
increasing deterioration of the situation in Cote
d'Ivoire is alarming, as is the contemptuous manner in
which Mr. Gbagbo has ignored the calls by the United
Nations and regional bodies in Africa. We are
concerned about the ongoing violations of the human
rights and fundamental freedoms of the civilian
population, including women and children. That merits
our unreserved condemnation - which is why we
reiterate the fundamental responsibility of Cote
d'Ivoire to protect all people on its territory. We hope
that the United Nations Operation in C6te d'Ivoire will
be able, in an atmosphere of impartiality, to contribute
to protecting the civilian population and its rights.

Colombia believes that by adopting this
resolution the Council is categorically reiterating its
determination to hold responsible those who hinder the
peace and reconciliation process and incite hatred and
violence. We therefore voted in its favour. The
sanctions against the individuals designated by the
Council should be carried out, with the international
community called upon to ensure their full and
effective implementation.

My delegation would like to underscore the
urgency of immediately putting an end to this violence.
We are convinced of the need to find a political
solution to the crisis in order to respect the will of the
people of Cote d'Ivoire and promote peace and
reconciliation among all Ivorians.

We reiterate that a solution to the crisis requires
acknowledging the results of the November 2010
elections. My delegation rejects Mr. Gbagbo's decision
to ignore the proposal for a political solution put
forward by the African Union High-Level Panel. We
urge him to give up power immediately.
