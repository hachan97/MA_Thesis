Mr. Elaraby (Egypt): I cannot accept a statement
made in the Security Council that says that bringing to
the Council a matter relating to the maintenance of
international peace and security in the Middle East - at
any time - would be a blatant misuse of the Security
Council.

We 15 members, regardless of how we voted today,
are acting on behalf of the membership of the United
Nations. We are members of the Security Council -
whether we are permanent members or non-permanent
members, whether we were elected or were accepted in
1945 as permanent members.
The Council is vested with the primary responsibility
for the maintenance of international peace and security.
The Council is entitled to look at any issue relating to
peace and security anywhere in the world. The Middle
East is not an exception.
