Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
voted in favour of resolution 2228 (2015), which was
just adopted.

China has followed the issue of Darfur with great
attention and appreciates the efforts made by the
Sudanese Government to stabilize the situation in
Darfur and promote the political process and economic
and social development in Darfur. The international
community should urge the parties concerned,
especially the rebel forces in Darfur, to adhere to a
path leading to a political solution, to participate in and
implement the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur and

to achieve an early and comprehensive solution to the
question, so as to lay a foundation for the development
and reconstruction of the region.

China appreciates the work done by the African
Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur
(UNAMID) in helping to stabilize the situation,
promote peace talks and protect civilians. China has
always maintained that a United Nations peacekeeping
operation should fully respect the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the country concerned, fully heed
the views of the country concerned and, in keeping with
changes in the local situation and actual needs, adjust
its mandate and scale.

The Security Council should attach importance to
the position of the Sudanese Government on the need
for an exit strategy to be formulated for UNAMID. We
welcome and support the setting up of a joint working
group on this issue between the United Nations
Secretariat, the Sudanese Government and the African
Union. We hope that the parties concerned will step up
their consultations so as to achieve a reasonable plan
that is acceptable to all for the phased withdrawal of
UNAMID.
