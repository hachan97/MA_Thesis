The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as the representative of the Republic of Korea.

My delegation thanks Ms. Bensouda for her
briefing. As always, her and her staff's valuable work
has become an indispensable part of the efforts to put
an end to impunity for those who committed heinous
crimes against humanity. In dealing with the Libyan
situation, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has
made meaningful achievements. In the process the
Libyan Government has been cooperative with the
ICC, although the situation on the ground has not
always been ideal for such cooperation. We appreciate
that cooperation on the part of the Libyan Government
and commend the follow-up consultation between the
ICC and the Libyan Government on the burden-sharing
memorandum of understanding. Such efforts should
continue.

Processing the remaining detainees as swiftly as
possible will be another step in the right direction.
Addressing the issue ofthe internally displaced persons
will also contribute to the progress of the national
reconciliation and the transition process.
With regard to the case against Saif Al-Islam
Al-Qadhafi and Abdullah Al-Senussi, we hope that
a workable solution that meets Libya's international
obligations and its domestic expectations can be found
through continued interactions between the Prosecutor
and the Libyan Government.

Today's briefing makes it clear once again that
cooperation between the Libyan Government and
the ICC is what separates the Libyan situation from
the other cases referred by the Council. We hope that
this cooperation will continue until the situation is
addressed to the satisfaction of the Libyan people and
the international community.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Libya.
