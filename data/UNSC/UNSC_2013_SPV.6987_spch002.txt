Mr. Ladsous (spoke in French): I promise to be
very brief.

As the Council knows, this week gives us the
chance to gather all of the military component Force
Commanders of the Missions. All of the Generals are
therefore present here today. In keeping with tradition,
we thought it would be useful for them to meet with
the Security Council for this interactive meeting. We
therefore decided to request three Generals to give short
briefings to the Security Council. Lieutenant General
Carlos Alberto dos Santos Cruz, Force Commander of
the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, will share his
thoughts on our efforts to use advanced technological
military capacity to implement the tasks included
in our mandates. Major General Leonard Ngondi,
Force Commander of the United Nations Mission in
Liberia, will speak about the evaluation within his
Mission ofpredeployment training. And Major General
Muhammad Iqbal Asi, Force Commander of the
United Nations Operation in Cote d'lvoire, will share
his thoughts on how inter-mission cooperation could
impact on crisis management by our Missions.
