Mr. Christian (Ghana): We welcome today's
unanimous vote on the renewal of the mandate of the
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).
We commend UNIFIL for its sacrifices and for its role
in the implementation of resolution 1701 (2006). We
also commend the peacekeeping partnership and the
cooperation between the Lebanese Armed Forces and
UNIFIL, and urge that measures taken to enhance the
level of cooperation between them be sustained. By
providing humanitarian assistance, UNIFIL is
contributing to the improvement of the quality of life
of ordinary Lebanese on a daily basis.

We are concerned by threats to the safety of
UNIFIL personnel and condemn the recent attacks on
such personnel resulting in the death of Spanish
peacekeepers and damage to a military police vehicle
belonging to the Tanzanian contingent. Ghana looks
forward to the outcome of the ongoing investigations
into those incidents with a View to bringing the
perpetrators to justice, and we call on all parties to
respect the principles of international law. Ghana
welcomes the measures taken so far by the Secretary-
General, including efforts to deploy additional risk
mitigation assets, to enhance the safety of UNIFIL
personnel.

In the light of the prevailing security and political
situation in Lebanon, Ghana, as a country contributing
troops to UNIFIL and in keeping with its dedication to
the pursuit of global peace and security, welcomes the
renewal of the existing mandate of UNIFIL, whose
continued presence will be desirable in consolidating
stability in Lebanon.
