The President: In accordance with rule 37 of
the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite
the representative of Colombia to participate in
this meeting.

In accordance with rule 39 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure, I invite Mr. Jean Arnault,
Special Representative of the Secretary-General and
Head of the United Nations Mission in Colombia, to
participate in this meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/20l6/1095, which contains the report of
the Secretary-General on the United Nations Mission
in Colombia.

In December, the members of the Security Council
welcomed the ratification by the Colombian Congress
of the new Final Peace Agreement between the
Government of Colombia and the Fuerzas Armadas
Revolucionarias de Colombia-Ejercito del Pueblo. It is
important to ensure that the international community
continues to fully support the Peace Agreement's
implementation so that it can rapidly deliver tangible
benefits that will enable the people of Colombia to live
in peace.

I now give the floor to Mr. Arnault.
