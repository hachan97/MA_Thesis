The President: I wish to remind all speakers, as
Ambassador Sawers indicated at this morning's
session, to limit their statements to no more than five
minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its
work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy
statements are kindly requested to circulate the text in
writing and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking in the Chamber.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Nigeria.
