Mr. Osvald (Sweden): We were deeply moved by the
news of the passing away of Deng Xiaoping, Paramount
Leader of China. He was the architect behind a process of
change in China of historic proportions. He will be
remembered by future generations, not least for stimulating
economic development and for raising the standard of living
and increasing the prosperity of the Chinese people, as well
as for his role in the opening up of China to the
international community.

On behalf of the Swedish Government, I wish to
convey to the Government and the people of China, and to
the family of Deng Xiaoping, our sincere condolences on
the great loss that they have suffered.
