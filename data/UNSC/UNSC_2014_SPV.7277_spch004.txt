Mr. Wilson (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom welcomes the fact that the Security Council
voted unanimously in favour of the renewal of the United
Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH).
We also welcome the spirit of compromise and
flexibility displayed on all sides during the negotiations
on the text of resolution 2180 (2014).

The unanimous adoption of the resolution sends
a strong message of united Council support for this
important Mission. The United Kingdom notes that
concerns have been expressed by some about the
provisions for the drawdown of the Mission. In that
respect, the United Kingdom welcomes the balance that
has been struck in the text.

Haiti has seen no military conflict in recent times,
and peacekeepers have been called out only twice in
the past 18 months to deal with security incidents.
As the Permanent Representative of Chile said, the
role of MINUSTAH should be to help Haiti take back
responsibility for its security, and not to perform that
task itself indefinitely.

The resolution provides for a responsible scaling
back of MINUSTAH's military component over time,
based on a thorough assessment ofthe security situation.
