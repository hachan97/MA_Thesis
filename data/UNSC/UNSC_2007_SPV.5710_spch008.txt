Mr. Al-Bader (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): I wish at
the outset to thank Mr. Demetrius Perricos, Acting
Executive Chairman of the United Nations Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC),
for his very illuminating briefing to the Council this
morning. We congratulate him on the manner in which
he has discharged his functions. Our thanks go also to
Mr. Gustavo Zlauvinen, representative of the Director
General of the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) to the United Nations, for his briefing.

The situation in Iraq has changed markedly since
the adoption of resolution 1284 (1999), on the
establishment of UNMOVIC. It is no longer necessary
for UNMOVIC to remain in that country in order to
verify the Iraqi Government's fulfilment of its
obligation to destroy weapons of mass destruction and
their delivery systems. We are pleased that that page of
this difficult file has been turned and that the reasons
for the opening of that file have now disappeared.

The Commission devoted much energy and
resources to its work in this area. It is now clear that
Iraq has no weapons of mass destruction; we hope that
the entire Middle East, including Israel, will be a
region free of nuclear weapons.

We are therefore in favour of the Security
Council adopting a draft resolution terminating the
mandate of UNMOVIC and requesting that remaining
unencumbered funds in the UNMOVIC account be
transferred to the Government of Iraq in order to meet
the aspirations of the Iraqi people.

We thank all those who have worked with
UNMOVIC and the IAEA and all other international
staff who successfully carried out the duties assigned
to them by the Security Council. We hope that we can
use the considerable experience acquired by
UNMOVIC over the years to strengthen international
peace and security.
