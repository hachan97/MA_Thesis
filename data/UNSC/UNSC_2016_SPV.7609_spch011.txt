Mr. Ibrahim (Malaysia): I should like to greet
Foreign Minister Holguin Cuellar of Colombia and
join earlier speakers in congratulating the delegation
of Colombia on this historic and momentous occasion,
which undoubtedly marks the beginning of the end
of the long-running conflict in that country. In this
regard, I wish to also express our position to the United
Kingdom delegation for its constructive and proactive
role in leading the negotiations on resolution 2261
(2016), just adopted by the Council.

The resolution just adopted authorizes the
establishment ofa special political mission ofthe United
Nations, comprising unarmed international observers
responsible for the monitoring and verification of
the laying down of arms and a part of the tripartite
mechanism that will monitor and verify the definitive
bilateral ceasefire and cessation of hostilities between
the parties, consistent with the joint communique of
19 January 2016 (see S/2016/53).

Pending the commencement of the mission,
which will be led by a Special Representative of the
Secretary-General and with personnel contributions
from the States members of the Community of Latin
American and Caribbean States, Malaysia urges both
the Government of Colombia and the Fuerzas Armadas
Revolucionarias de Colombia - Ejercito del Pueblo to
spare no effort towards the expeditious conclusion of
the final peace agreement. We further believe that the
establishment of the mission will contribute positively
to increasing the level of comfort and confidence
between the two parties, with a view to consolidating
the gains already achieved.

We firmly believe that taking this step towards a
peaceful resolution of the conflict in Colombia will
pave the way towards ensuring lasting peace, security
and prosperity for all sections of society in the country.
Malaysia looks forward to receiving proposals from
the Secretary-General on the establishment and
operationalization of the mission, and reaffirms its
readiness to work closely with all Council members,
concerned partners and stakeholders in that regard.
