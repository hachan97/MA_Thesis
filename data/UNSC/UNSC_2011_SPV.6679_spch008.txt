Mr. Osman (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): I would
just like to take two minutes to clarify that Jau is an
inseparable part of the territorial integrity of the Sudan.
What we heard today is not true. Yes, the 9th Division
of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement is in Jau,
but its presence is illegitimate and a form of
occupation of those lands. The land itself is 100 per
cent northern territory.

A second point I would like to comment concerns
the reference to paragraph 10 of resolution 1990
(2011), which established the United Nations Interim
Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA). With regard to the
civilian aspect of the mission, I affirm that we are fully
committed to the resolution in its entirety, but
especially paragraph 10, which relates to that civilian
aspect. We expect that all aspects of the UNISFA
mandate, including human rights monitoring, will be

implemented by UNISFA's civilian component. In
other words, civilian implementation is the letter and
the spirit of the resolution. We do not expect any new
foreign entity to be formed outside the scope of the
resolution. It should rather fall within the framework of
the civilian component of UNISFA, as is the practice
followed by all peacekeeping missions.

The delay in the formation of administrative
bodies is a very important issue that I would like to
emphasize. The Secretary-General's report
(S/2011/74l) states that the delay occurred because the
Government of South Sudan did not cooperate in the
8

nomination process. Once these bodies are established -
we are ready for them, and our nominees are ready -
they will take charge of all administrative issues, such
as the return of internally displaced persons, human
rights monitoring and impartial administration of the
region. It is the Government of South Sudan that is
really obstructing all of this.
