Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
I wish to thank Assistant Secretary-General Kalomoh
for his briefing on the situation in Guinea-Bissau. I
wish also to thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs of
Timor-Leste, Mr. Jose Ramos Horta, Special Envoy of
the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries. We
welcome his presence as well as his presentation.

China is concerned about recent developments in
Guinea-Bissau. However, we have noted recent
changes in the situation, including the appointment of
an interim President and an interim Prime Minister.
Representatives from various parties are engaged in
talks about matters relating to the transitional period.
We hope that the situation will be restored to normal
and that the economy will be rehabilitated and
developed.

China appreciates the constructive role played by
the Economic Community of West African States and
the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries in
finding a solution to the crisis in Guinea-Bissau. The
question of Guinea-Bissau demonstrates once again the
importance of the development of the economy and the
interdependence of political and economic issues. The
international community has the obligation to increase
its economic and financial assistance to Guinea-Bissau
in order to eradicate the difficulties faced by the people
so that the country can advance on its path to normalcy
and healthy development. China stands ready to work
with the United Nations and regional organizations for
an early solution to the question of Guinea-Bissau.
