The President (spoke in Russian): Under rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite
the representative of Burundi to participate in this
meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2011/782, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by France.

I wish to draw the attention of the members of the
Council to document 8/2011/751, which contains the
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
Office in Burundi.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China,
Colombia, France, Gabon, Germany, India,
Lebanon, Nigeria, Portugal, Russian Federation,
South Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland and United States of
America

The President (spoke in Russian): There were
15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 2027 (2011).

I now give the floor to the representative of
Burundi.
