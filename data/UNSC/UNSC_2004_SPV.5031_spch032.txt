Mr. Mufioz (spoke in Spanish): Allow me first to
express my thanks for the strong support for the work
of the Al Qaeda and Taliban sanctions Committee, for
the Monitoring Team of the Committee and for myself
and the coordinator of the Team. We consider that
encouragement important for us to pursue the
outstanding challenges.

There were no questions to me personally, or to
the Team coordinator, but there have been many
suggestions. We have taken good note of the
suggestions and shall be studying them in the
Committee. We shall strive to give effect as well to the
Team's recommendations, which we have begun to
analyse. Possibly, if the Committee so decides, we may
come back to the Council, as many delegations have
requested this morning, to propose improvements and
new measures to combat terrorism. That is not simply a
mandate from the Security Council, but ultimately it is
an ethical obligation for all of those who want to see a
more stable and secure international community.
