Mr. Dahlgren (Sweden): Let me start by expressing
our pleasure in seeing you preside over this important
meeting of the Council.

In our View, the draft resolution on which we are
about to vote contains four very important messages, each
addressed in a separate paragraph.

First, the draft resolution endorses the Memorandum
of Understanding signed by the Secretary-General and by
the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq. We all recall that the
Secretary-General undertook his important mission to

 

Baghdad with the full support of the Security Council. In
this draft resolution, it is made clear that the Council is also
backing the outcome of his mission.

Secondly, the Security Council is determined to see
the resolution implemented and will not tolerate a violation.
The Council's message is firm and clear: a violation would
have severest consequences for Iraq.

Thirdly, this draft resolution means that if Iraq
complies with all its obligations under relevant resolutions,
it will be possible for the Security Council to lift the
sanctions, as stipulated in its resolution 687 (1991).

Fourthly - and very important for us - the Security
Council' 5 responsibility for international peace and security,
as laid down in the Charter of the United Nations, must not
be circumvented. The last paragraph of the draft resolution
is an expression of the need to safeguard this responsibility.
The Council will remain actively seized of the matter, and
the Council will ensure implementation of this resolution.

In conclusion, in our View the United Nations means
working together. And working together will lead to results.

Sweden will vote in favour of the draft resolution
before us.
