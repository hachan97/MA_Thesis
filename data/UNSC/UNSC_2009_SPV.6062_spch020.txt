The President (spoke in French): I thank the
High Commissioner for the clarifications he has
provided. Unfortunately, in certain cases antibiotics are
less effective and not as quick as one would hope.

I would like to thank Mr. Guterres for his
presence and for the extremely useful information he
28

gave us. I think that the statements made by the
members of the Council attest to their full support for
the High Commissioner himself and the work of his
Office and its staff. I believe that these statements also
attest to our interest in having regular exchanges with
the High Commissioner on the numerous challenges
facing both his Office and the Security Council.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
