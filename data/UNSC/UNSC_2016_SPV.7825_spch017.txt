Mr. Okamura (Japan): Japan supported the
draft resolution (S/2016/1026) proposed by the
three co-penholders - Egypt, New Zealand and
Spain - because we believe that it could have served
as a tool to meet the pressing humanitarian needs in
Aleppo and elsewhere in Syria. As Japan has often
emphasized, our most important priority is to take
action that improves the situation on the ground,
regardless of the ongoing political impasse.

It is deeply regrettable that the Security Council
has once again failed to overcome its differences. The
Council is ultimately responsible for addressing the
devastating humanitarian situation in Syria. We have
worked hard, and we are close to reaching an agreement
on how to alleviate the protracted suffering of the
Syrian people. I sincerely urge all Council members
not to abandon our collective and individual efforts,
and to resume our discussions immediately after
today's meeting.
