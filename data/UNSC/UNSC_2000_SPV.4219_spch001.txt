The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
decides to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mrs. Sadako Ogata,
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

It was so decided.

The President: I welcome Mrs. Ogata and invite
her to take a seat at the Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees, Mrs. Sadako Ogata, who has contributed so
much to the worldwide protection of refugees and the
resolution of the refugee problem since taking office in
1991.

I give the floor to Mrs. Ogata.
