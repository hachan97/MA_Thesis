Mr. Tsymbaliuk (Ukraine): I would like to thank
the representative of the Russian Federation for his
recommendations, and I hope we will see each other
more frequently around this table next year.

I would first like to say that our statement fully
coincided with the concept paper distributed before the
meeting (S/2015/845, annex) and with the topic under
discussion. I also have a very short recommendation for
the Russian delegation. For us, a key goal is not just
assembling here in order to discuss problems; it is also
to solve those problems, and in order to do that, we first
have to comply with the Security Council's resolutions.
I would like to remind the Russian representative
of resolution 2202 (2015), and I really hope that his
delegation will be able to start complying with its
provisions and make every possible effort to fulfil
those of the Minsk agreements as well.
