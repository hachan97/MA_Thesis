The President (spoke in French): I now give the
floor to Mr. Richard Holbrooke, Permanent
Representative of the United States, who headed the
Security Council mission to the Democratic Republic
of the Congo and who undertook the laudable initiative
of holding the summit of 24 January in this very
Chamber.
