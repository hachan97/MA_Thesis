The President: At the outset of the meeting, I should
like, on behalf of the Security Council, to express deep
sympathy to the Government and people of Ukraine for the
great loss of life suffered as a result of the recent mining
catastrophe in the Barakov mine in the eastern part of
Ukraine. I would request the representative of Ukraine to
convey to his Government and to the bereaved families our
deep condolences.
