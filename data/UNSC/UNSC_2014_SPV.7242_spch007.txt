Mr. Lamek (France) (spoke in French): France
welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 2170
(2014), which demonstrates the Security Council's
determination to act against the Islamic State in Iraq
and the Levant. Following the Security Council's firm
condemnation in July of the abuses perpetrated by
that terrorist organization against ethnic and religious
minorities, the resolution enables us to go further in the
fight against terrorism.

The resolution is also a new milestone in the
necessary mobilization of the international community
to address the threat posed to all by the Islamic
State in Iraq and the Levant. The sanctioning of six
individuals connected to that organization and the
Nusra Front is a decisive step in the fight against those
groups. France, which has made the struggle against
the phenomenon of foreign fighters a national priority,
welcomes this decision to sanction those individuals
who are continuing to provide foreign fighters to those
networks.

The fight against terrorism is a key issue in Iraq, in
which France is playing its full role alongside the Iraqi
authorities. However, that does not mean that we can
forget the crucial need to find a political settlement.
France welcomes the designation of Mr. Al-Abadi as
Prime Minister as an important step towards forming
an inclusive Government that represents all Iraqis,
which will make it possible to find a lasting solution to
Iraq's challenges. It is crucial that the Prime Minister
form a Government as soon as possible, within the
timetable set out by the Constitution. France reiterates
its full support to Iraq at this crucial moment.
