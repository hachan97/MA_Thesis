The President (spoke in Arabic): As this is the
last scheduled meeting of the Council for the month
of February, I would like to express the sincere
appreciation of the delegation of Kuwait to the members
of the Security Council, especially my colleagues the
Permanent Representatives, their respective staff and
to the secretariat of the Council for all the support they
have given to us.

Indeed, February has been a busy month, and
one in which we rallied to consensus on several
important issues within our purview. We could not
have done it alone or without the hard work, support
and positive contributions of all the delegations and
the representatives of the Secretariat, as well as all
the relevant conference service officers, interpreters,
translators and security staff.

As we end our presidency, I know I speak on
behalf of the Council in wishing the delegation of the
Netherlands good luck in the month of March.

I now invite Council members to informal
consultations to continue our discussion on the subject.

The meeting rose at 12.45 pm.
