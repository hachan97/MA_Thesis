Mr. Barkin (United States of America): We are
pleased with the Council's strong statement of support
for the United Nations Mission for the Referendum
in Western Sahara (MINURSO) and its mandate. We
believe that the time has come for a just, lasting and
mutually acceptable political solution that will provide
for the self-determination of the people of Western
Sahara. While we are disappointed that some members
of the Council chose yet again to abstain in the voting,
we know that the Council is united in its conviction that
the political process must continue without delay.

We would like to express our appreciation to
former President Kohler and his team for their historic
achievement in bringing Morocco, the Frente Popular
para la Liberacion de Saguia el-Hamra y de Rio de Oro,
Algeria and Mauritania together. I would also like to
thank Special Representative of the Secretary-General
Colin Stewart and the entire MINURSO team for their
efforts. We urge the parties to work constructively
with MINURSO. Furthermore, we look forward to the
Secretary-General's appointment of a new Personal
Envoy as soon as possible. This will take the political
process forward and ensure that the momentum
generated by former President Kohler is not lost.

There is one thing I would like to make clear,
though. The renewal of MINURSO for 12 months in
these unique circumstances does not mean a return to
business as usual. The United States therefore calls
on the parties to conduct a dialogue in good faith
and without preconditions, remembering the central
importance of including women and young people. We
also urge countries with influence in Western Sahara to
think creatively about how to move the peace process
forward so that we can support a new personal envoy
once in place. A lasting breakthrough will require the
willingness of all involved to approach negotiations
with a genuine desire to make progress.
