Mr. Traore (Guinea) (spoke in French): I would
like to warmly welcome Deputy President Zuma and to
thank him for his important statement. I would also
like, on behalf of my country, to thank the South
African Government for the very commendable efforts
that they have been making to restore peace and
stability to the Great Lakes region, and to Burundi in
particular. I would also like to thank the other
facilitators for their valuable contributions to the
resolution of the conflict in the region.

My delegation welcomes the recent signing in
Arusha of a ceasefire agreement between the
Transitional Government of Burundi and the Forces for
the Defence of Democracy - the main opposition
party. We believe that that represents an important step
forward towards a comprehensive ceasefire among all
the Burundian parties. In that connection, we appeal to
those movements that have not yet done so to return to
the negotiating table, to work for peace and put an end
to the terrible suffering of the people of Burundi. We
also appeal to the signatories of the ceasefire
agreement to abide by their commitments and to
translate into reality the fervent aspirations of the
people of Burundi, who truly desire to live in peace
and to benefit from peace.

We also appeal to the donors to continue their
financial support for the peace process, so that there
can be a lasting and definitive peace in Burundi.

In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my
delegation's full support for the third parties in their
ongoing efforts to resolve the crisis in Burundi.
