Mr. Maleski (The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia): I should like to express our appreciation of
China's presidency of the Security Council this month.

Allow me, Mr. President, to extend the appreciation of
the Government of the Republic of Macedonia of the work
of the Security Council on the draft resolution concerning
the new mandate - of the United Nations Preventive
Deployment Force. The Government of the Republic of
Macedonia pays tribute to the personnel of the United
Nations Protection Force for the work that they have done
so far.

The Republic of Macedonia - a country which
achieved its independence through a policy of peaceful self-
determination - expresses its readiness to work together
with the Security Council in our common endeavour
towards peace in the Balkans.
