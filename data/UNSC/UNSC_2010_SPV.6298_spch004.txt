Mr. Mansour (Palestine): I warmly congratulate
you, Mr. President, and your friendly country Japan on
your presidency of the Security Council. We also
express appreciation to the friendly country of Gabon
for its skilled guidance of the Council's extensive
agenda in March. I also thank Under-Secretary-General
Lynn Pascoe for his comprehensive briefing today.

I would like to extend the condolences of my
delegation to the people and Government of China for
the victims of the earthquake that occurred today.

Since the Council's last open debate in January,
the situation on the ground in the occupied Palestinian
territory, including East Jerusalem, has regrettably
deteriorated owing to continuing Israeli acts of
aggression, colonization, provocation and incitement
against the Palestinian people and their land.
International and regional efforts to revive the peace
process and the continued extension of the Palestinian
leadership's hand in peace have only been responded to
by Israel with intransigence and defiance. To this
moment, Israel persists with its illegal policies,
undermining those peace efforts, stoking tensions on
the ground and inflaming religious sensitivities in the
region and beyond.

In just the short period since that previous debate,
we have conveyed 12 letters to the Council, drawing
attention to the series of illegal actions that continue to
be perpetrated by the occupying Power and the
consequent negative impact on the ground, including
the following: the continuing Israeli colonization of
occupied Palestinian territory, particularly in and
around East Jerusalem, including plans for the
construction of thousands of new settlement units;
continuing confiscation of Palestinian property,
demolition of homes and transfer of settlers, including
in the Shu'fat, Al Bustan, Al Abbasiya and Sheikh
Jarrah neighbourhoods of East Jerusalem, and
continuing settler acts of terror against Palestinian
civilians and their property; the targeting of
Palestinian, international peace activists and
non-violent demonstrators, including by use of
excessive, indiscriminate force; the provocative Israeli
declaration laying national claim to historic religious
sites in the occupied Palestinian territory in Al-Khalil
and Bethlehem; the storming of the Haram al-Sharif
compound by the Israeli occupying forces, the
targeting of Palestinian Muslim worshippers and the
restriction of access to holy sites in the Old City;
repeated inflammatory statements and incitement by
Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Netanyahu,
particularly regarding East Jerusalem; violent military
raids by the occupying forces and the killing of
civilians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the
consequent heightened tensions and widespread unrest;
the ongoing traumatic impact of the illegal Israeli
blockade of Gaza on the humanitarian situation, social
and economic conditions and the dignity of the
Palestinian people; the arrest and detention of
Palestinian officials and Christian community leaders
engaged in non-violent protest against restrictions on
worshippers during the Easter holiday and against
other oppressive Israeli practices; the closure of the
West Bank and continued obstruction of the freedom of
movement; the desecration of the Ma'man Allah
cemetery in Jerusalem; and the recent Israeli orders
threatening the deportation of thousands and, I must
add, tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians.

This is just a synopsis of the extremely distressful
situation faced by the Palestinian people and their
leadership at the present time - a situation marked by
the blatant intensification of illegal Israeli settlement
activities and human rights violations against the
Palestinian civilian population. All of this coincides -
and, it appears, not incidentally - with the
intensification of international efforts led by the United
States of America, with the active engagement of the

other Quartet members - the European Union,
Russian Federation and United Nations - and by the
League of Arab States, aimed at resolving the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict via the two-State solution for
peace. Those collective efforts are constantly being
undercut by the occupying Power's illegal actions,
wilfully perpetrated and totally contradictory to a
peaceful settlement on the basis of the two-State
solution.

The pattern is clear. It is one in which Israel
continues to act with flagrant impunity, sabotaging
peace initiatives and causing further suffering to the
Palestinian people under its occupation. In word and
deed, it is apparent that Israel is bent on breaching the
Fourth Geneva Convention and creating facts on the
ground that illegally and artificially alter in its favour
the demographic composition, character and status of
the occupied Palestinian territory, especially in and
around East Jerusalem - facts on the ground that
impair all aspects of Palestinian life, imposing constant
humiliation and hardship on the civilian population,
whether in the West Bank or the Gaza Strip.

All of the occupying Power's illegal policies call
into question its credibility as a peace partner, its
commitment to the two-State solution and its standing
as a member of this Organization, to which it owes its
very existence. Rather than reciprocate the efforts and
gestures made for peace - from the explicit
commitment to peace and the two-State solution based
on the pre-l967 borders made by the Palestinian
leadership, beginning with the Palestinian Declaration
of Independence over 20 years ago; to the Madrid,
Oslo, Taba, Sharm el-Sheikh and Annapolis
commitments; the Arab Peace Initiative over eight
years ago; the road map to Mideast peace and the
Quartet Statement; the diplomatic efforts of the United
States of America and all other concerned nations -
Israel continues to pay only lip-service to the pursuit of
peace, while its actions are actually destroying any
chance for the realization of peace.

In this regard, after a long freeze in the peace
process and despite severe reservations owing to
Israel's continued illegal policies, particularly its
settlement activities, the Executive Committee of the
Palestine Liberation Organization agreed to proximity
talks mediated by the United States. However, within
days of this announcement, the Israeli Government
announced its approval of the construction of yet
another 1,600 new settlement units in occupied East

Jerusalem, which was preceded by the approval of
another 112 settlement units in Bethlehem and
followed, despite broad condemnation, by the
revelation of plans for another 20 illegal settlement
units near the Shepherd Hotel in East Jerusalem. Such
flouting of the law and the international demands for a
settlement freeze can only lead to the conclusion that
the current Israeli Government has no interest in
defusing rising tensions and is in fact set on derailing
peace efforts.

In addition, Israel recently declared the villages
of Bil'in and Ni'lin in the West Bank, which have been
the sites of weekly non-violent demonstrations against
the Wall and the settlements and have been closed
military zones for six months. The occupying forces
have repeatedly responded with force to those protests
and have carried out arrests of Palestinian peace
activists, adding to the thousands of Palestinians
already being illegally held in Israeli prisons, as well
as arrests of international activists there, clearly aimed
at crushing any attempts at peaceful, non-violent
protest and at denying Palestinians their human and
political rights to freedom of expression and to protest
the occupation policies.

Moreover, recent Israeli raids in the West Bank
constitute another ill-willed attempt to undermine the
Palestinian Authority and its serious security efforts in
the cities, towns and villages under its control, efforts
that have been recognized by the international
community. And, most recently, new Israeli military
orders have been revealed by which the occupying
Power seeks to further advance its ethnic cleansing
campaign, threatening the deportation of tens of
thousands of Palestinians from the West Bank, and
particularly from East Jerusalem, in violation of the
Fourth Geneva Convention, human rights law and
relevant Security Council resolutions.

At the same time, Israel continues its illegal
blockade of the Gaza Strip. On 12 March, Palestinians
solemnly marked the thousandth day of the blockade,
under which more than 1.5 million Palestinian
civilians- some 70 per cent of whom are refugees
and over 50 per cent of whom are children - have
endured the merciless effects of a hermetically sealed
border and total isolation from the rest of the
Palestinian territory and the outside world. The
magnitude of the humanitarian and psychological
suffering and despair and the undoing of development
deliberately inflicted by this criminal Israeli collective

punishment of the Palestinian people in Gaza cannot be
overemphasized. Here, we wish to thank the Secretary-
General for his recent visit to Gaza and his firm calls,
along with the calls of many other world leaders, on
Israel to end the blockade, to allow for Gaza's
reconstruction and to allow the healing of the
population. Upholding the rule of law, including
respect for Security Council resolution 1860 (2009),
and our collective conscience demand immediate
redress of this unjust, inhumane situation.

On the other hand, and despite such flagrant
violations, the Palestinian leadership has continuously,
responsibly affirmed its commitment to peace in word
and deed. The Arab countries have also consistently
done so, based on the understanding of the need for a
comprehensive resolution of this conflict and for
regional and international peace and stability, as
reflected by the Arab ministerial follow-up
committee's agreement to give an opportunity to
proximity talks and the lack of objections at the Arab
Summit in Libya, despite great reluctance owing to
Israel's ongoing defiance. Yet Israel made it impossible
for the Palestinian side to enter such talks as it
continued to dig in its heels and declare its illegal
settlement intentions, especially in East Jerusalem. We
understand that the United States Administration has
requested clarification from the Israeli Government in
this regard, but as of now it appears that such
clarification has yet to be received.

Although we have repeatedly affirmed our
position, we reiterate today that we can not proceed
with negotiations, including proximity talks, as long as
Israel continues to violate international law, United
Nations resolutions and Quartet positions regarding the
settlements. Israeli settlement activities, including
so-called natural growth, and all other illegal attempts
to alter the character, status and demography of the
occupied Palestinian territory, including East
Jerusalem, must cease immediately to allow for the
resumption of a credible, meaningful peace process.

What we have witnessed in these last months is a
reaffirmation of Israel's impunity. Persisting with its
repeated ruses, empty pretexts and arrogant
declarations, Israel refuses to acknowledge that it
cannot reconcile its expansionist agenda and its
oppression of another people with the most basic tenets
of international law that govern our international
system. And it cannot reconcile its criminal behaviour
with a changing international climate that is now
demanding in very clear terms a cessation of the
human rights abuses and grave breaches that have
severely compounded this conflict, thwarted all efforts
to resolve it, and undermined regional and global peace
and security. It is time for the international community
to act decisively, guided by the rules and principles of
international law and justice, in order to finally bring
an end to the Israeli occupation and enable the
Palestinian people to exercise their inalienable right to
self-determination and freedom in their independent
State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living side by
side with Israel in peace and security on the basis of
the pre-1967 borders, and to achieve a just resolution
of the plight of the Palestine refugees in accordance
with international law and United Nations resolutions,
with the full knowledge that both elements are
requisite for the realization of a just, lasting and
comprehensive peace.

The Security Council, in particular, must assume
its role - a role seriously marginalized in this conflict -
and must take practical measures to compel Israel to
cease all of its illegal settlement activities in the
occupied Palestinian territory, including East
Jerusalem, and finally commit to the pursuit of peace.
Moreover, it is essential for the Council, at the
appropriate time, to adopt a resolution framing the
parameters of the solution to this conflict - a solution
that does not need to be reinvented but rather
originates from clear, established principles based on
international law, United Nations resolutions, the
Madrid terms of reference, including the principle of
Land for Peace, the Arab Peace Initiative, the road map
to Mideast peace, and most recently the conclusions of
the Council of the European Union on the Middle East
Peace Process of 8 December 2009 and the firm
position underscored by the Quartet in Moscow on
19 March 2010, including, inter alia, the goal of
achieving a peaceful settlement within 24 months.

The international consensus in this regard is clear
and must be pursued without delay. We cannot allow
Israel to continue to act above the law, defy the calls to
end its violations from all corners of the globe,
including by its closest allies, and make a mockery of
the urgency of achieving peace and security for our
region and the international community as a whole.
Israel has put us in this situation too many times before
and we have witnessed the disastrous consequences.
For this reason, the international community must no
longer judge Israel on what it says, but rather by the
actions it takes, and hold it fully responsible, should it
sabotage the opportunity before us to secure peace
once and for all.
