Mr. Inchauste Jordan (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): The Plurinational State
of Bolivia thanks the Minister for Foreign Affairs of
Austria, Mr. Sebastian Kurz, for his briefing in his
capacity as Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). We
also congratulate Austria on its assumption of the
chairmanship of the OSCE and on its commitment to
maintaining peace in Europe.

Bolivia believes that it is important to highlight the
work being done by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe in its various areas of operation
and in maintaining channels of dialogue with different
actors. We believe that all conflicts between States
should be addressed in strict compliance with the
Charter of the United Nations, international law and
international human rights law, always with the aim
of resolving them peacefully and, at the same time,
respecting the principles of the non-interference in the
internal affairs of States, the non-use or threat of force,
sovereignty and independence.

As we have previously mentioned in the Chamber,
Bolivia believes that regional and subregional
organizations can play a very important role in
maintaining regional stability and security and can
contribute decisively in the peaceful resolution of
conflicts. On the other hand, it is important to identify
the circumstances and action taken by NATO that
have contributed to causing conflict situations or
to interventionism.

We hope that communication and coordination
channels between the United Nations and the OSCE
will be maintained and strengthened for the benefit of
regional and international peace and security.
