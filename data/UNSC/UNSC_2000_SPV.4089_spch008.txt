The President: I thank the Ambassador of France
for his kind words of support for the "month of Africa",
and for his accurate appreciation of what will be
attempted this month.
I would now invite Mrs. Ogata to respond to the
four or five questions put directly to her at the beginning
of Ambassador Dejammet's remarks, concerning West
Africa, Sierra Leone, Guinea and the humanitarian impact
of the situation between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
