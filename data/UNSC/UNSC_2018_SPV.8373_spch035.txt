Mr. Al-Mouallimi (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): When truth appears, liars flee. I did not want
to take more of the Council's precious time to respond
to the nonsense of my colleague the representative of
the Syrian Arab Republic, first, because I personally
sympathize with him and secondly, because I
sympathize with our brother people of Syria, who are
suffering at the hands of their leaders and politicians.
However, the Syrian regime and those who represent
it are the last people who should speak of morality
and accusations the way Syria's representative did.
He brings up the disappearance of one journalist but
seems to ignore the thousands of journalists who have
vanished into Syrian prisons, or the people who have
been forcibly disappeared and killed, who number not
just in the thousands but in the tens of thousands.

He speaks ofthe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as being
responsible for the problems of the entire world. The
only thing he has not yet blamed it for is the tsunami
that recently hit Indonesia. We know quite well that
his regime is the one that opened the doors to enable
terrorism in Syria to threaten the entire region. That
regime has no moral right to speak as itjust has, because
its record is riddled with flaws, both hidden and visible,
as we have seen everywhere and in every forum.
