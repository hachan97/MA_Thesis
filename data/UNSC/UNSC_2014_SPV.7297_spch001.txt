The President: The Security Council will
now proceed to the election of five members of the
International Court of Justice, in accordance with
Article 13 of the Statute of the International Court of
Justice, to fill the five seats that will become vacant
upon the expiry of the terms of the following Judges
on 5 February 2015: Judge Bernardo Sepulveda-
Amor (Mexico), Judge Kenneth Keith (New Zealand),
Judge Mohamed Bennouna (Morocco), Judge Leonid
Skotnikov (Russian Federation) and Judge Joan E.
Donoghue (United States of America). The list of
candidates, indicating the national groups by which
each candidate was nominated, is contained in
document S/2014/521.

I should like to inform members of the Council
that I have received a letter addressed to me by the
Legal Counsel, dated 3 November 2014, informing
me, on behalf of the Secretary-General, that after
the established deadline for nominating candidates,
namely, 30 June 2014, several national groups
submitted nominations to the Secretariat. I should like
to draw the Council's attention to the fact that all such
additional nominations relate to candidates already
nominated by other national groups and whose names
therefore already appear in document S/2014/521. The
Legal Counsel recommended that, in accordance with
established practice, I inform Council members orally
on the day of the election about the decisions of the
aforementioned national groups. I am also informed
that the Legal Counsel made a similar recommendation
to the President of the General Assembly.

The nominations of the aforementioned national
groups are as follows: for Mr. Mohamed Bennouna,
Belgium; for Ms. Susana Ruiz Cerutti, Belgium,
Croatia and the Czech Republic; for Mr. James Richard
Crawford, Belgium, the Czech Republic and Romania;
for Ms. Joan E. Donoghue, Belgium, the Czech Republic
and Lithuania.

I should also like to inform Council members
that I have received a letter from the Legal Counsel,
dated 5 November 2014, informing me, on behalf of
the Secretary-General, that in a note verbale dated
5 November 2014, the Permanent Mission ofMauritania
to the United Nations communicated to the Legal
Counsel that the national group of Mauritania had
decided to withdraw the nomination of Mr. Jemal Agatt
for election to the International Court of Justice. Since
Mr. Agatt was nominated only by the national group
of Mauritania, his name is not included on the ballot
papers.

The Security Council has before it a memorandum
by the Secretary-General, contained in document
S/2014/520, describing the present composition of the
Court and setting out the procedure to be followed in
the conduct of the election. I should like to remind
the Council that, under Article 10, paragraph 1, of the
Statute of the International Court of Justice,

"Those candidates who obtain an absolute
majority of votes both in the General Assembly
and in the Security Council shall be considered as
elected".

The required majority in the Security Council is
eight votes.

If, in the first ballot, the number of candidates
obtaining an absolute majority is less than five, then
pursuant to rule 61 of the provisional rules of procedure
of the Security Council, the Council will proceed to
a second ballot on the remaining vacancies. Balloting
will continue in the same manner until five candidates
have obtained the required majority of votes.

If, on the other hand, more than five candidates
obtain the required majority, according to established
practice and as set forth in paragraph 13 of the
Secretary-General's memorandum, a new vote will be
held on all the candidates. That rule will also apply to
any subsequent ballots, if the number of candidates
obtaining the absolute majority is greater than the
number of vacancies remaining.

The voting will be held by secret ballot. When we
proceed to the vote, members ofthe Council will receive
a ballot containing the names of all the candidates. No
withdrawal will be accepted once the ballot papers
have been distributed. However, it will be possible to
withdraw between ballots.

Members of the Council will be requested to place
an "X" in the box next to the names of the candidates for
whom they wish to vote. Only those candidates whose
names appear on the ballot are eligible for election.

I should like to remind members of paragraph 10 of
the Secretary-General's memorandum, which specifies
that "[e]ach elector may vote for not more than five
candidates on the first ballot". Any ballot paper
containing votes for more than five names will be
considered invalid.

I should like to inform Council members that, in
accordance with established practice, the ballot papers
in the Security Council will not be counted until it
has been verified that the ballot papers in the General
Assembly have also been collected. The Council
will remain in session pending the receipt of that
information.

Only when five candidates have obtained the
required majority of votes in the Security Council, I
shall communicate the result to the President of the
General Assembly, and I shall request the Council
to remain in session, pending the receipt from the
President of the General Assembly of the result of the
voting in the Assembly.

The Council will now proceed to draw lots to select
two delegations to serve as tellers.

The delegations of Argentina, the Russian
Federation, the United States and my own delegation,
Australia, will not be considered to serve as a teller
because candidates of their nationalities have been
nominated.

The names of the delegations of Chad and Chile
have been drawn. I request each of them to appoint one
of their members to serve as teller.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Gombo
(Chad) and Mr. Cabezas (Chile) acted as tellers.

The President: May I take it that the Council is
now ready to proceed with the election of five members
of the International Court of Justice?

It is so decided.

I request the Conference Officer to distribute the
ballot papers.

Members of the Council should place an "X" in the
boxes next to the names ofthe five candidates for whom
they wish to vote.

The President: I take it that all the members of
the Council have now voted and I ask the Conference
Officer to collect the ballot papers.

The President: All the ballot papers have been

pending the receipt of that information.

papers have been collected in the General Assembly.

The counting of the ballots in the Security Council
will now begin. The tellers will now count the ballots.
As agreed in our consultations, there will be two
independent countings of the ballots, one by each
teller. I should like to remind Council members that
in accordance with established practice, I shall wait
for the General Assembly to complete its count before
I announce the results of the voting in the Security
Council. The Council will remain in session.

Accordingly, the following candidates received
the required majority of votes in the Security Council:
Mr. Mohamed Bennouna, Ms. Susana Ruiz Cerutti,
Mr. James Richard Crawford, Ms. Joan E. Donoghue
and Mr. Kirill Gevorgian. I have communicated the
result of the voting to the President of the General
Assembly in writing.

I wish to inform members ofthe Council that I have
received the following letter from the President of the
General Assembly:

"I have the honour to inform you that, at the
39th plenary meeting of the General Assembly,
held today for the purpose of electing five
members of the International Court of Justice, the
following candidates obtained an absolute majority
of votes in the General Assembly: Mr. Mohamed
Bennouna, Mr. James Richard Crawford, Ms. Joan
E. Donoghue, Mr. Kirill Gevorgian and Mr. Patrick
Lipton Robinson."

As both the Security Council and the General
Assembly have agreed on the following candidates, the
jurists Mr. Mohamed Bennouna, Mr. James Richard
Crawford, Ms. Joan E. Donoghue and Mr. Kirill
Gevorgian have been elected as members of the
International Court of Justice for a term of office of
nine years beginning on 6 February 2015. I should like
to congratulate them on all our behalf and to wish them
every success in the high office to which they have
been elected.

As a result of the voting that has taken place in
the Security Council and in the General Assembly,
four members of the Court have been duly elected. In
accordance with Article 11 of the Statute of the Court,
the Council will need to hold a second meeting to elect
a candidate for the seat remaining to be filled.

In that regard, I have been informed by the
President of the General Assembly of the withdrawal
of the candidatures of Ms. Euge'nie Liliane Arivony and
Mr. Sayeman Bula-Bula, as indicated to the Assembly
in the statements of the Permanent Representatives
of Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of the
Congo delivered to the General Assembly. Therefore,
Ms. Eugenie Liliane Arivony and Mr. Sayeman Bula-
Bula are no longer candidates in these elections and
their names will be deleted from the ballot papers.

Accordingly, I intend to convene the Security
Council tomorrow morning at 10 am. for the pending
element of the voting for the remaining seat on the
International Court of Justice.

The meeting rose at 6.20 pm.
