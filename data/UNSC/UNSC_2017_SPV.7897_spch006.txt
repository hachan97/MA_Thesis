Mr. Rosselli (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): This is
not the first time that I do not know whether to thank
Mr. O'Brien for his briefings, which generally strike at
the very core of our being. Of course, we thank him for
moving us so profoundly, for doing this in-depth work
and for sharing it with us so frequently.

I would have wished to speak before the Ambassador
of France, who basically, delivered my entire statement.
There is very little left of what I wanted to say that has
not already been said by him. Our intention was to speak
of the common denominator linking humanitarian
crises, which is that they take place within the context
of conflicts. It is therefore essential to find a solution to
those conflicts. To that end, it is necessary for all who
can exert their influence to do so. At the same time,
allowing access for humanitarian assistance to the
civilian population is fundamental.

Although the French Ambassador completely
shattered my statement, allow me to stress one
issue that has long been of particular concern to my
delegation - indiscriminate attacks against hospitals,
schools and civilian infrastructure. Scores of hospitals
have been attacked, with great loss of life. In Yemen,
for example, half of the existing hospitals are not
operational. Given that the essence of what I wanted
to say has already been covered, I will not take up any
more time.
