Mr. Delattre (France) (spoke in French): France
welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 2479
(2019), which provides for the technical renewal of the
mandate of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid
Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) for four months. I
would like to warmly thank the United Kingdom and
Germany for having put forward the resolution.

France has always supported a responsible and
prudent withdrawal of UNAMID, depending on the
situation on the ground. To decide on the closure of
the mission, we need a legitimate Government that is
fully recognized by the international community. The
current political uncertainty in the Sudan fully justifies
the temporary suspension of the mission's withdrawal.

I would like to recall that we strongly condemn
the violence that has occurred in Khartoum and other
cities in recent weeks and call for the perpetrators to be
brought tojustice. We call on all stakeholders to exercise
restraint. The challenge today is to resume political
dialogue in order to achieve a negotiated and agreed
transition, spearheaded by a civilian-led Government.

In that regard, France welcomes the efforts
undertaken by the African Union, supported in
particular by the Ethiopian mediation, and calls on the
United Nations to fully support those initiatives.

Finally, we are very concerned about the increase
in tensions and acts of violence in Darfur, and call on
the international community to do its utmost to prevent
the region, which remains very fragile, from flaring up
again. UNAMID therefore retains an important role.
It is essential that the mission's assets be temporarily
maintained in order to ensure the protection of civilians
and the reporting of human rights violations and to
facilitate the settlement of intercommunal conflicts, as
well as to provide humanitarian access and allow for
the protection of humanitarian personnel.
