Mr. Takasu (Japan): This is the twelfth 90-day
report to the Security Council in accordance with
paragraph 18 (h) of resolution 1737 (2006). The report
covers the period from 10 September 2009 to
10 December 2009, during which time the Committee
held no meetings but conducted its work using the
silence procedure.

On two occasions, the Committee received
reports of further violations of paragraph 5 of
resolution 1747 (2007), which imposed an export ban
on arms and related materiel on the Islamic Republic of
Iran. In line with its mandate to examine and take
appropriate action on information regarding alleged
sanctions violations, the Committee has studied these
reports carefully and notes with grave concern an
apparent pattern of sanctions violations involving
prohibited arms transfers from Iran.

In the first instance, the Committee received
letters from two Member States regarding the presence
of suspicious cargo originating from Iran and destined
for another State aboard the M/V Hansa India chartered
by the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines
(IRISL). The vessel was redirected to a port of one of
the reporting States, where the cargo was offloaded and
inspected. According to this State, the cargo contained
arms-related materiel. The State reported that, in line
with its international obligations, it retained, unloaded
and stored the cargo, and that the State will ensure that
2
the items are neither allowed to reach their intended
destination nor returned to their place of origin.

In the second instance, the Committee received a
letter from a Member State regarding the presence of
suspicious cargo originating from Iran and destined for
another State aboard the Francop, again shipped by
IRISL. With the consent of the relevant authorities, the
vessel was boarded by the navy of the reporting State,
which conducted an on-board State inspection.
According to this State, the cargo contained arms-
related materiel. The State reported that, in line with its
international obligations, it unloaded, retained and
stored the cargo, and that the State will ensure that the
items will neither be allowed to reach their intended
destination nor returned to their place of origin.

In response to each of these reports, the
Committee dispatched letters to the two States
involved in the transfer of the arms-related materiel,
inviting them to provide an explanation for the
transactions as well as additional relevant information
about the origin, final destination and ownership of the
goods. The Committee reminded both States of their
obligation to accept and carry out the decisions of the
Security Council under Article 25 of the Charter of the
United Nations, noted with great concern the fact that
the Committee had received multiple reports of
violations of paragraph 5 of resolution 1747 (2007)
involving these States, and recalled that the violation
by Member States of their obligations under the
Charter is a serious matter. The Committee also
requested that both States respond to the Committee
within 15 days. The Committee also wrote to all three
reporting Member States, expressing its appreciation
for their responsible actions and urging them to
continue to cooperate closely with the Committee and
with any other States that might be investigating the
cases.

Finally, the Committee wrote to the States with
the reported links to the Francop, inviting them to
provide any additional relevant information. In those
same letters, the Committee highlighted the need for
Member States to redouble their efforts to ensure the
full implementation of resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747
(2007) and 1803 (2008); drew attention to the
involvement of IRISL in multiple incidents involving
the transport of items in violation of resolution 1747
(2007); and, with reference to its Implementation
Assistance Notice of 24 July 2009, strongly urged
09-64217
Member States to exercise extra vigilance as regards
IRISL.

During the period under review, the Committee
received three notifications from a Member State,
pursuant to paragraph 15 of resolution 1737 (2006), in
connection with the unfreezing of funds to make
payments due under contracts entered into prior to the
listing of an entity.

Finally, with regard to reporting by States on the
implementation of all relevant measures set out in
resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007) and 1803 (2008),
the figures remained unchanged: 91 reports under
resolution 1737 (2006), 78 reports under resolution
1747 (2007) and 67 reports under resolution 1803
(2008).
