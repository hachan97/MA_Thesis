Mr. Strommen (Norway): Let me begin by
wishing Vice-President Zuma a very warm welcome to
New York. We are very grateful for his briefing this
afternoon. I should like to add that we are also very
thankful to Deputy President Zuma for the way in
which he has consistently maintained a relationship
with the Security Council on this issue. I recall his very
warm hospitality when we visited him in Pretoria in
April. I should also like to welcome Ambassador Jean-
Marc de la Sabliere to the Security Council.

The Government of Norway recognizes that the
peace process in Burundi is at heart a regional
initiative, but the Security Council is a partner and
plays a vital role, and we, as the Council, must do our
part. We, of course, welcome the ceasefire agreement
between the Government and the Forces for the
Defence of Democracy (FDD). That is a significant
step, but it is far from sufficient to achieve peace in
Burundi. We feel that, in many ways, it is important
that the agreement now be followed through in all its
aspects, including with regard to the FDD's
participation in the transitional arrangements, the army
reform and the reintegration of demobilized soldiers.

Nevertheless, it is necessary to express concern
over the potentially escalating tension, the situation on
the ground in Burundi and the fact that the National
Liberation Forces (FNL) remains outside the peace
process, with no ceasefire agreement in place. It is very
worrisome that progress may not be achieved with
regard to that point in the near future.

The international community must do its utmost
to contribute urgently to a solution with regard to the
remaining challenges in the peace process in Burundi.
In that spirit, we look forward to the Council
consultations scheduled for this Friday. We will bear in
mind what Vice-President Zuma has told us. Given the
nature of the situation, no feasible measure must be left
untried by the Council.
