Ms. Guadey (Ethiopia): Let me first of all thank
Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo for her briefing.

We have followed the situation around the Sea of
Azov and we are concerned by the rapid escalation of
the situation in the area. It is vital that all efforts be
made to reduce tension. We support today's call of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
on the parties to exercise maximum restraint and refrain
from taking actions that would further undermine the
security and stability of the area. We also agree that
there is a need for the parties to address their differences
through political and diplomatic means.

On the issue of Ukraine, we once again reiterate
our support for the implementation of the Minsk
agreements for the peaceful settlement of the crisis. We
believe that it is absolutely imperative that the parties
remain fully committed to the implementation of the
Minsk agreements and strictly adhere to resolution
2202 (2015), which endorsed the package of measures
for the implementation of the Minsk agreements.
