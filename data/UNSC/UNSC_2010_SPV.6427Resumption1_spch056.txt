Mr. Karanouh (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): One
of today's speakers claimed to care for Lebanese
civilians. What is worse, that party continues not only
to occupy Arab land but also to exercise aggression
against its neighbours. It continues to challenge the
resolutions of this Council and the provisions of
international law and international humanitarian law
and to violate the Geneva Conventions, especially by
indiscriminately attacking, killing, besieging and
displacing innocent civilians, not sparing civilian
facilities from its bombings and destruction.
