Mr. Simeon (Haiti) (spoke in French): As this
meeting of the Council draws to a close, I should like
very briefly to again thank the brotherly country of
Argentina for having organized this special debate, and
to convey to you, Mr. President, my friend Rafael
Bielsa, heartfelt congratulations for the skill with
which you have conducted the proceedings.

I should also like to thank all those who
responded to his appeal today. The level at which they
participated demonstrates the level of solidarity that
they feel with my country. I would like to thank them
for their acts of solidarity and for the understanding
that they have shown of our problems, which has been
apparent from all of their statements. I would also like
to thank them for having sincerely voiced their
concerns and offered their advice. I promise that that I
will report back to my Government and, through the
media, to my people and to the social and professional
organizations in my country. I would also like to say
that, with their support, we will move forward in the
future - I know that their support will always be
friendly and based on feelings of solidarity.
