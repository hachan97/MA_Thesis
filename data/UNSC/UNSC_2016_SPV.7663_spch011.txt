The President: Before inviting Council members
to informal consultations to continue our discussion on
the subject, as this is the last scheduled meeting of the
Council for the month of March, I would like to express
the sincere appreciation of the delegation of Angola to
the members of the Council, especially my colleagues
the Permanent Representatives, their respective staff
and to the Secretariat of the Council for all the support
they have given to us.

Indeed it has been a busy month, and one in
which we rallied to consensus on several important
issues within our purview. We could not have done
it alone and without the hard work, support and
positive contributions of every delegation and the
representatives of the Secretariat, as well as all relevant
conference service officers. As we end our presidency,
I know I speak on behalf of the Council in wishing the
delegation of China good luck in the month of April.

I now invite Council members to informal
consultations to continue our discussion on the subject.

The meeting rose at 11.35 am.
