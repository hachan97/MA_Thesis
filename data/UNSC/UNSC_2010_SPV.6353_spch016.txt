Ms. Colakovie (Bosnia and Herzegovina): At the
outset, allow me to congratulate you, Madam
President, on your assumption of the presidency of the
Council and assure you of the full cooperation and
support of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I would also like
to express our appreciation to Ambassador Heller and
his delegation for the great diplomatic skill with which
they conducted the work of the Security Council during
the month of June.

I would like to thank Mr. Lamberto Zannier,
Special Representative of the Secretary-General and
Head of the United Nations Interim Administration
Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), and General De
Kermabon for their briefings. I would also like to
welcome the participation in today's meeting of the
President of Serbia, Mr. Boris Tadic', as well as
Mr. Skender Hyseni.

Bosnia and Herzegovina condemns the tragic
event that occurred in the town of Mitrovica on 2 July
2010, in which one person was killed and 11 others
were wounded. We regret the loss of life, and we wish
to express our deepest condolences and sympathies to
the families and friends of the victims. Furthermore,
we would like to call for an investigation into the
incident and for those who are responsible to be
brought to justice. We wish to appeal to the parties to
act in a responsible manner and refrain from
provocation so that peace may prevail.

Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly encourages the
continuation of the process of reconciliation, dialogue
and confidence-building, facilitated and mandated by
United Nations Interim Administration Mission in
Kosovo.
