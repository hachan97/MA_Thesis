Mr. Otunnu: I thank you, Mr. President, for
inviting me to brief the Security Council, and I thank
you very much for your deep interest and for your
commitment to helping the children of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo. I have taken note of all the
important comments made by Council members and
other delegations. I will act on them and will continue
the dialogue with the Council. My Office is at the
Council's disposal to work with its members.

I very much hope that the Council will consider
incorporating into the draft resolution it is preparing
for subsequent adoption some of the practical
recommendations I have placed before it.

Again, I thank you, Sir; I thank the members of
the Council; and I thank all the other delegations that
participated in this discussion. The children of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo need us; we must
not let them down.
