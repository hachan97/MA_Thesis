The President (spoke in French): I thank the
Secretary-General for his statement.

In accordance with the agreement reached by the
Council in its prior consultations, I now give the floor
to Ambassador Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Chairman of
the Counter-Terrorism Committee, to make a statement
under rule 39 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.
