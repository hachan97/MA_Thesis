The President: I again remind everyone of the
existence of presidential note S/2017/507. We return to
the issue of Syria every month. That is plenty of time
for people to make their points.

There are no more names inscribed on the list
of speakers. I now invite colleagues to come to the
Consultations Room for informal consultations on
two subjects.

The meeting rose at 11.15 am.
