Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): As I have taken the
floor once today already, I will be brief. With regard
to Karl Marx, I think he must be turning in his grave
to see what the country that was founded on many
of his precepts is doing in the name of supporting
Syria by condoning the use of chemical weapons on
Syrian territory.

We voted against the Russian draft resolution
(S/2018/l75) for a number of reasons. The Russian text
is a distraction. It has lain dormant around the Security
Council for weeks. There was no attempt to meet other
Council members' concerns in its drafting, unlike the
United States text (S/2018/321), which had adapted its
original preferences precisely to try to meet those of
the Russian Federation and others. The Russian text
does nothing to bring a political process any closer.
Specifically, it moves the parameters on access
and imparts a quasi-judicial standard - "beyond a
reasonable doubt" - that is inappropriate for the type
of investigation that the Council wishes to establish.
If the Russians want a criminal investigation, they
could always suggest that we refer the matter to the
International Criminal Court. Furthermore, there is
selective quoting of the Chemical Weapons Convention
to undermine the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative
Mechanism, and it takes a selective approach to the
parameters of the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons.

But, above all, the text is unacceptable because
it seeks to assert that sovereign States are above
international law and international norms. That is
breathtaking both in its arrogance and its ignorance,
and for that reason alone, if not the others, we could
not support it.
