Mr. Matondo (Spoke in French): First of all, in my
capacity as Special Representative of the Chairperson
of the African Union Commission for the Central
African Republic and Central Africa, I would like to
highlight what an honour it is to be able to review the
situation in the Central African Republic four months
after the signing of the Political Agreement for Peace
and Reconciliation in the Central African Republic.

The political dialogue process led by the African
Union through the African Initiative for Peace and
Reconciliation in the Central African Republic was
completed at the end of 2018, paving the way for talks
in Khartoum between the Government of the Central
African Republic and the armed groups. The talks
began on 25 January and ended on 5 February this year
with an agreement between the Government and the
14 armed groups. An initial signing ceremony of the
agreement concluded between the parties took place on
5 February in Khartoum, followed by a formal signing
ceremony by the parties on 6 February in Bangui.
Against that backdrop, the topic it is my honour to
address in the Security Council today is the status of
the implementation of the agreement, in particular
with regard to the progress achieved, the difficulties
encountered, the actions taken by the guarantors and the
facilitators, the main challenges and recommendations.

With regard to the progress made as of20 June, much
more has been achieved by the Government. To date,
four months after the signing of the agreement, I would
note at the political level, for information purposes, the
appointment ofa Prime Minister, Mr. Firmin Ngrebada,
on 25 February, and the formation of an inclusive
Government, on 22 March, after the rejection of a first
Government deemed less inclusive by the parties to
the agreement.

In terms of monitoring the agreement, I would
note the adoption of all the regulatory texts setting
up the monitoring implementation mechanism as
well as the structures provided for by the agreement
and the operationalization of the structures for the
implementation and monitoring mechanism, including
the Executive Monitoring Committee, which has
already held three meetings, the Technical Secretariat to
support the Executive Monitoring Committee, and the
National Implementation Committee, the Prefectural
Implementation Committee and the Technical Security
Committee, which are currently being set up. As part of
the transitional security arrangements, the regulatory
texts for the Unites speciales mixtes de securite have
been adopted, and they are in the process of being
stood up. With regard to reconciliation and transitional
justice, an inclusive commission has begun its work,
and the national popular consultation in preparation for
the establishment of the truth, justice, reparation and
reconciliation commission was launched on 6 June,
with work is ongoing.

In terms of security, since the signing of the
agreement, there has been an overall decrease in
tension and in the number of clashes between armed
groups and the Central African Armed Forces,
supported by the United Nations Multidimensional
Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African
Republic (MINUSCA), despite a few regrettable cases
of assassination, rape and theft of livestock, especially
in the west, north and east of the country.

As for the difficulties encountered, while the
Government can be pleased with the efforts made
to honour commitments, the armed groups for
their part are not really enthusiastic. The update on
the implementation of the agreement made by the
Executive Monitoring Committee during its three
working meetings indicated that the results remain far
from what was hoped for or expected. Indeed, cases of
violations of non-compliance with the implementation
of the agreement continue to occur on the ground,
and mostly involve violations and abuses against
civilian populations and humanitarian workers, sexual
violence against women and girls, obstruction of the
free movement of persons and goods, the erection of
barriers and the collection of illegal taxes, a failure
to return public buildings and military camps and the
theft of livestock.

The most serious, and intolerable, violation of
the agreement took place on 21 and 22 May in the
communes of Koundjili, Bohong and Lemouna, in the
prefecture of Ouham-Pende', where more than 40 people
were massacred by members of the Mouvement pour
le retour, reclamation et rehabilitation, supposedly in
retaliation after several Peul herders were killed during
an incident of cattle raiding. It should be pointed out
that the massacre seriously undermined the peace
agreement, to the extent where it gave certain elements
of the media and parties to the agreement an opportunity
to further disparage it.

Despite the strong pressure on the Government
and the guarantors and facilitators to the agreement
to confront the perpetrators of the massacre directly,
thus far they have shown wisdom in using the crisis-
resolution mechanism provided for in the agreement.
Furthermore, the training and deployment of the Unite's
speciales mixtes de securite could serve to rein in
once and for all the causes of the recurring conflict
between herders and farmers in certain regions of the
country. It is also worth noting that, in the light of the
upcoming elections, some people could exploit this
most unfortunate event by politicizing it.

As for the steps taken by the guarantors and
facilitators to the agreement, we would like to highlight
the consultations convened by the Chairperson of the
African Union Commission from 18 to 20 March, with
a view to finding a solution to the crisis following the
formation of the first inclusive Government on 3 March.
The tripartite African Union-European Union-United
Nations deployed a mission from 14 to 18 April to
evaluate the agreement and advocate for inviting all
political forces across the nation to join and support
the agreement. A second meeting of the International
Support Group for the Central African Republic was
held on 17 April, with a view to harmonizing the
interventions of the various actors and mobilizing
resources in support of the agreement.

The actions of the guarantors and facilitators
following the tragedy on 21 and 22 May included
three joint missions made up by the Government,
the guarantors, including the African Union and the
Economic Community of Central African States,
and facilitators, including the United Nations
Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission
in the Central African Republic, to visit the areas in
question and gain insight into the events, support and
comfort the population and alleviate tensions.

They also met with the leader of the Mouvement
pour le retour, reclamation et rehabilitation, Mr. Sidiki
Abass, to hear his version ofthe facts and to communicate
the requirements of the Government and the guarantors
to the agreement. The main demands conveyed to him
following the massacre in Paoua were that he arrest
and indict the perpetrators of the massacre, as well as
those who absconded from the competent authorities,
so that they might be tried and punished in accordance
with the law; that he dismantle all barriers and military
bases associated with the group; that he enrol individual
combatants in the national disarmament, demobilization
and reintegration (DDR) programme; and that he
cooperate fully with the competent authorities and the
agreement guarantors to combat impunity.

The Mouvement pour le retour, reclamation et
rehabilitation has recently shown its willingness to
cooperate by identifying three perpetrators of the
tragedy in Paoua, but we are still awaiting news on the
whereabouts ofother suspects. The secondjoint meeting
of the Government, the guarantors and the facilitator
with Mr. Abass was held on 18 June in Bocaranga,
just two days ago, during which he affirmed his
adherence to the peace process; his commitment to the
implementation of the agreement, especially with regard
to the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration
of all of the group's elements as from 29 June; his active
participation in the formation of the Unites speciales
mixtes de securite' and his commitment to search for all
alleged perpetrators of the May 21 massacre and hand
them over to the competent authorities.

Similar efforts are being made by the guarantors
and facilitators with regard to the other leaders of
armed groups - including Ali Darassa of the Unite
pour la paix en Centrafrique on 12 June - to remind
them of the need to respect their commitments in the
framework of the implementation of the agreement. We
should nevertheless note the constructive attitude of
certain armed groups, such as the Front populaire pour
la renaissance de la Centrafrique, which is committed
to removing all its illegal barriers and releasing the
buildings it continues to occupy illegally in the areas
under its control.

One of the main challenges we face includes
combating unemployment and poverty through the
implementation of an intensive, large-scale programme
aimed at former members of armed groups, youth and
local communities for the construction and rehabilitation
of priority infrastructure throughout the national
territory of the Central African Republic. There are
also the challenges of mobilizing sufficient resources
required to operationalize the mechanism for the
implementation and monitoring of structures relating
to the peace agreement; creating conditions conducive
to the effective implementation of the agreement,
especially with regard to DDR and the setting up of the
Unites speciales mixtes de securite; fostering a climate
of peace and national solidarity among all Central
Africans; preventing the emergence of new armed and
political groups hostile to peace and stability within the
country; and, finally, establishing favourable conditions
for the holding of the upcoming elections, while taking
into consideration time constraints and others related to
limited material resources.

Against that backdrop, and taking into account the
progress made as well as the difficulties encountered
by the guarantors and facilitators, including the
main challenges to implementation, we would like to
make the following recommendations to the Security
Council: to appeal to the international community
regarding the need to mobilize the necessary
resources for the reconstruction of the Central African
Republic and the implementation of labour-intensive
development projects; to encourage the Government
of the Central African Republic to maintain the same
spirit of openness and dialogue with armed groups
and all stakeholders in Central African society; to
maintain the framework of dialogue with armed groups
by, among other things, exerting political pressure on
them to respect their commitments; and to ensure all
the necessary conditions for the swift initiation of the
national DDR programme and the formation of the
Unites speciales mixtes de securite.

We also recommend that the Council further
mobilize resources for the effective operationalization
of the agreement's implementation and monitoring
mechanism for preparations for the forthcoming
elections; intensify efforts to popularize the agreement
among the armed groups of all political forces active in
the Central African Republic so that they appropriate and
fully adhere to its letter and spirit; urge all such forces
to refrain from committing acts that are detrimental to
social cohesion and national reconciliation; reinforce
the mechanisms for transitional justice and the truth,
justice, reparations and reconciliation commission
in order to put up a firm fight against all forms of
impunity; and help the subregion become more involved
in the quest for a peaceful and lasting solution to the
crisis in the Central African Republic, in particular by
reactivating bilateral mixed commissions.

Our final recommendation is that the Council
lead the call for the strengthening of humanitarian
assistance in the fight against malnutrition and for the
reintegration of displaced persons and refugees.

We commend the countries of the subregion that
have kindly included the search for a peaceful and
lasting solution to the crisis in the Central African
Republic on their agendas. I would also like to reiterate
my thanks to the United Nations for its contribution and
cooperation with the African Union in the peace and
stabilization process in the Central African Republic.
Finally, I take this opportunity to commend all partners
of the Central African Republic for their readiness and
assistance in the implementation of the agreement and
development projects in the country.
