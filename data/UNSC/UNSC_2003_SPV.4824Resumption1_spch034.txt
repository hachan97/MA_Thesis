The President: On the present schedule, could I
say to my colleagues around the table that I am
working on an assumption that there will be a certain
amount of time available and that informal
consultations will start at 5.30 pm. That is my working
assumption for the moment.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Indonesia, whom I now invite to take
a seat at the Council table to make his statement.
