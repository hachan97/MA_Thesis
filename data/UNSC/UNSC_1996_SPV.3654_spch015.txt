Mr. Plumbly (United Kingdom): It is a source of
satisfaction to my delegation that the Council has now
unanimously adopted a clear, strong and balanced
resolution, which we believe will underpin the efforts being
made to resolve the present crisis.

The British Government remains deeply concerned
about the situation as it affects both Lebanon and Israel. As
we noted in our statement here on 15 April, the British
Government has condemned the continuing rocket and other
attacks by Hezbollah on northern Israel, which started the
present crisis.

The British Government deeply deplores the loss of
innocent civilian lives in Lebanon, in particular the
terrible tragedy at the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) base earlier today. I would like to
extend the British Government's condolences to the
wounded and to the families of all those killed during the
recent hostilities.

What we must do now is to focus on the future and
to do all that can be done to prevent further such
tragedies. What is needed - a point on which the
resolution is very clear - is an immediate cessation of
hostilities. To prevent the recurrence of hostilities and to
create a more stable situation, we must build on the 1993
arrangements. The United Kingdom fully supports the
efforts of the United States and France in this regard. My
Prime Minister had discussions to this end with Prime
Minister Hariri in London on 17 April and has been in
touch with President Chirac, President Clinton and Prime
Minister Peres.

The British Government is convinced that the
long-term solution to the problem will be the result of the
successful conclusion of the Middle East peace process.
We reaffirm our support for the implementation of
Security Council resolution 425 (1978). We call on all
parties to the peace process to redouble their efforts to
reach a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the
Middle East.
