Mr. Acufia (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): We would
like to thank you, Mr. President, for having convened
this open meeting of the Security Council - the first
on this subject since 23 April. Chile once again
expresses its support for what we believe could prove
to be one of the most important peace-building
enterprises in the history of the United Nations: the
United Nations Interim Administration Mission in
Kosovo (UNMIK), a mission in which our country
feels honoured to participate. We commend the work
carried out by Mr. Michael Steiner, the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General in Kosovo,
and all the staff of UNMIK over the past four years.

We would like to thank Mr. He'di Annabi,
Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping
Operations, for his enlightening description of the
situation in Kosovo and in Serbia and Montenegro.

We would like at the outset to express our great
consternation at the reprehensible murder of a Serbian
family in Obilic on 4 June. We reject, in addition to
that crime, all acts of violence, harassment and
discrimination on ethnic grounds * actions that run
counter to the achievement of a multi-ethnic, modern
and democratic Kosovo.
With regard to the recent decisions taken by
UNMIK, we reaffirm that, in terms ofthe economy and
of investment, resolution 1244 (1999) constitutes the
cornerstone of the process. Resolution 1244 (1999) is
the guiding principle and must determine decisions on
Kosovo. The decisions adopted in accordance with the
mandate set down by that resolution must be heeded
and respected by the parties.
