Mr. Heusgen (Germany): Kuwait, Belgium and
Germany, the co-penholders of the humanitarian
dossier, are in favour of a balanced approach to the
choice of briefers. We expect every briefer to respect
today's humanitarian, non-political agenda, and we
trust that the Head of the Russian Reconciliation Centre
will support that agenda in his briefing as well. Since
the de-confliction mechanism is on our agenda today,
and we would like to understand why it has failed utterly
and led to the death of innocent civilians, the Centre
may be able to shed some light on that question. We
note the presence today in the Chamber of the Executive
Director of the Syrian American Medical Society,
which should complement the rest of the picture.
