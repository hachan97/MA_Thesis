Sir John Weston (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland): The United Kingdom is in favour
of extending the mandate of the United Nations Support

 

Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH), as proposed in the draft
resolution before us. We are firmly of the view that the
continuation of UNSMIH's work in Haiti is essential to
maintain the peace and stability of that country. We are
grateful to all the contributors to UNSMIH, in particular
Canada and the United States, for their crucial role in
ensuring the success of the Mission so far.

We are pleased to note the Secretary-General's
assessment that the security situation in Haiti continues to
improve. However, the danger of destabilization by armed
opposition groups remains. Violent crime is on the increase
and is a cause for concern. The Haitian National Police is
still at the fledgling stage of its development and is not yet
capable of taking full responsibility for public security. That
is why the continuing support of the international
community is so important.

The United Kingdom commends the Government of
Haiti for its efforts in support of UNSMIH. We must all
work with the Government to ensure that governmental and
judicial institutions are strengthened to give Haiti the
necessary foundations for a stable democracy. We hope that
the necessary reforms of the judiciary will be implemented
soon, relieving the pressure on the court system.

Haiti has been a success story for the United Nations.
We recognize that the United Nations has remained in Haiti
longer than originally envisaged. But we must not now
endanger our previous investment in peace in Haiti through
precipitate actions that could threaten the stability of that
country.
