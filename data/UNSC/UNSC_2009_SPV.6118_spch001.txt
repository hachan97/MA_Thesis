The President (spoke in Russian): As this is the
first meeting of the Security Council for the month of
May 2009, I should like to take this opportunity to pay
tribute, on behalf of the Council, to His Excellency
Mr. Claude Heller, Permanent Representative of
Mexico to the United Nations, for his service as
President of the Security Council for the month of
April 2009. I am sure I speak for all members of the
Security Council in expressing deep appreciation to
Ambassador Heller for the great diplomatic skill with
which he conducted the Council's business last month.

Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

him the floor.
