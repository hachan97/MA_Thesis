The President: I thank the Minister for that very
interesting contribution. I look forward to the debate
taking forward some of the questions that she has
raised and the lessons that she has tried to teach us
from the Sierra Leone experience.

I am now very happy to welcome the Senior
Vice-President of the World Bank, Mr. Marwan
Muasher, who is going to share his views with us.
