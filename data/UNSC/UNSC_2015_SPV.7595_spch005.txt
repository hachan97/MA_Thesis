Mr. Wang Min (China): China welcomes the
unanimous adoption of resolution 2258 (2015). The
conflict among the various parties in Syria goes on.
The humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate
amidst the devastation wrought by the Islamic State
in Iraq and the Sham and other terrorist organizations,
bringing untold suffering to the Syrian people. China is
deeply saddened by the situation and sympathizes with
the plight of the Syrian people.

China supports the efforts of the United Nations
humanitarian agencies in undertaking relief activities
and coordinating international assistance in Syria,
on the basis of respect for Syrian sovereignty. We
call on the parties in Syria to honour their respective
obligations and to effectively implement resolution
2258 (2015) and all previous resolutions of the Security
Council so as to ensure that cross-border relief can
make a real difference in easing the suffering of the
Syrian people.

At present, fighting terrorism is the highest priority
of the international community. We hope that the
international community will give full consideration to
the need to combat terrorism in delivering cross-border
relief, and that it will form synergies in the fight against
terrorism. A political settlement is the only way to
resolve the crisis and an essential option for mitigating
the humanitarian situation in Syria and relieving its
people's suffering.

On 18 December, the Security Council unanimously
adopted 2254 (2015) on the political process in Syria.
The resolution embodies the broad consensus within
the international community and demonstrates the
important role that the Council can play. It also reflects
the earnest hopes of the Syrian people and has given
impetus to a political solution. China hopes that the
parties will work together, swiftly implement resolution
2258 (2015) and give peace a chance so that the Syrian
people can regain tranquility.
