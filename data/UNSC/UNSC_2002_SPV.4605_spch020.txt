Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
First of all I wish to welcome you, the Foreign Minister
of Bulgaria, here today to preside over this meeting. I
also wish to thank Assistant Secretary-General Annabi
for his comprehensive briefing.

Since the last meeting of the Security Council
devoted to the question of Kosovo, the situation there
has undergone many changes, some of which are
encouraging while others are, regrettably, disturbing.
The arrest of former Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)
members who are crime suspects helps the
establishment of justice in Kosovo. We support efforts
made by the United Nations Interim Administration
Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and KFOR in this regard.
At the same time we hope that UNMIK will intensify
its investigative efforts and bring all perpetrators of
crimes to justice in order to lay a solid foundation for a
society based on the rule of law in Kosovo.

The Chinese delegation condemns all attacks
against United Nation personnel and appeals to parties
concerned to take necessary measures to ensure their
safety. Our delegation has always been very concerned
about the return of refugees and displaced persons. We
have noted that recent developments have hampered
the return of some ethnic minorities. We hope that
UNMIK will consider this matter important and take
effective measures to create an environment conducive
to the return of refugees and create a favourable
atmosphere for the October municipal election.
