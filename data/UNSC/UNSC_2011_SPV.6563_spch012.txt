Mr. Barbalie (Bosnia and Herzegovina): We
would like to thank Ambassador Osorio for his briefing
on the work of the Security Council Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1737 (2006) during
the past 90 days. We note that the 1737 Committee has
done very effective work in that period, which we
highly appreciate.

The role of the Panel of Experts is essential for
the full implementation of resolution 1929 (2010). We
therefore welcome the adoption of resolution 1984
(2011), which extends the Panel's mandate for another
year. We also welcome a number of practical
recommendations contained in the final report of the
Panel of Experts aimed at improving the
implementation of sanctions provisions and at assisting
Member States in meeting their obligations under those
provisions.

According to the latest report of the Director
General of the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA), the international community has still not
received a clear and unequivocal answer from Iran
regarding the purpose and nature of its nuclear
programme. Therefore, we reiterate our call upon Iran
to comply with all resolutions of the Security Council
and implement the additional protocol, as well as all
measures requested by the IAEA. It is imperative to
restore mutual confidence and be certain that Iran's
nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes.

In conclusion, Bosnia and Herzegovina still
believes that the diplomatic and negotiation-driven
approach with Iran, based on both good political will
and responsible judgment, can redress the current
situation. With this in mind, we call for additional
serious efforts by the parties directly involved and

sincerely hope that they will demonstrate the political
will to move the process forward.
