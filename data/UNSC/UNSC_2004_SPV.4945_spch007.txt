Mr. Zinsou (Benin) (spoke in French): The
critical situation prevailing in the Middle East and, in
particular, on the Palestinian front has continued to
deteriorate over the last few months.

During this crisis, my country has continually
exhorted all parties to demonstrate the greatest possible
restraint and to give a chance to the peaceful settlement
plan, contained in the road map approved by the
Security Council.

My delegation therefore does not understand the
continuation of the practice of extrajudicial executions,
carried out in flagrant violation of international law
and international humanitarian law. The execution of
Mr. Al-Rantisi took place less than two months after
that of Sheik Yassin, which was condemned by the
overwhelming majority of the international community.
This execution is a new challenge to international
legality. We believe that the continuation of the policy
of extrajudicial executions targeting Palestinian leaders
does serious damage to the efforts of the international
community to restore peace, a peace for the living and
not the peace of cemeteries. Such is the objective in the
Middle East, and we need to remember that.

We renew here our urgent appeal to all the parties
to return to dialogue to achieve our shared vision of
two States living in peace, side by side, within stable
and internationally recognized borders. We urgently
demand that the Quartet make use of all of its influence
with the parties to put an end to the cycle of violence in
the Middle East and return to the commitments
undertaken under the road map.

In this regard, we doubt the logic of the proposed
course of action, a partial disengagement of the
occupied territories. In our view, this disengagement
would not be a positive step in the right direction,
unless it is conducted in a way designed to strengthen
the peace process. We want to see an end to
provocations and we hope for the reign of international
law.
