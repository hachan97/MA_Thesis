The President (spoke in French): There are no
further speakers on my list.

Let me draw some personal conclusions from
today's debate. First of all, I want to thank all of the 45
colleagues who participated in the discussion, as well as
the Secretary-General, who took part in the debate. A
debate like today's offers both an opportunity and a
challenge. It gives all of us - in particular non-members
of the Council - an opportunity to state our views on the
functioning of the Security Council. Our colleague from
the United States used the term "consumer survey"
(S/PV5968, p. 10), which I think nicely sums up one of
the purposes of the debate.

It also poses a challenge. The question of the
working methods of the Security Council continues to
be a sensitive matter, as shown by the fact that 14 years
have passed since the first open debate on the issue,
held in 1994. For that reason, I greatly appreciated the
tone of the statements we heard, which was sometimes
frank but generally very constructive.

In my national statement, I indicated that, if
concrete and achievable ideas emerged from this
debate, I would it take it to be a success. I have in fact
taken note of a good number of such ideas. I also noted
that most delegations highlighted the key role of the
Council's Informal Working Group on Documentation
and Other Procedural Questions and urged it to benefit
from today's debate in order to come back to the
Council as soon as possible with a specific outcome.
Such an outcome would, in my view, likewise provide
both an opportunity and a challenge for all of us. I
hope that today's lengthy meeting will be the first step
in that direction.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 5.30pm.
