Mr. Cardi (Italy): I also wish to express my
personal sorrow and that of my authorities for the loss
of Ambassador Vitaly Churkin. He was an outstanding
diplomat. Above all, he was a loyal colleague, someone
who was always transparent and able to serve the
best interests of his country. He was also a friend. I
admired him - we admired him - and we will miss
his professional abilities and his warm, personal human
touch. Our condolences go to his wife and children
and the rest of his family, his friends, Mr. Iliichev and
his other colleagues at the Russian Mission, and the
Russian authorities.
