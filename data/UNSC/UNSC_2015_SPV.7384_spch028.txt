Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): If Ukraine needs to find a way for dialogue it
should do so at last. But they are unable to do so. That
is why we keep saying, let us establish dialogue with
the people in the east. But Ukraine says that we are
interfering. They are asking us: What do the people in
the east want? We say that the people in the east want
federalization. They should therefore go and find that
dialogue.
