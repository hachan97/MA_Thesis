Mr. Capelle (Marshall Islands): It is an honour
for me to address this open meeting of the Security
Council. I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for
convening this meeting, thereby giving smaller
delegations such as my own an opportunity to
participate in a debate on this crucial matter.

The Republic of the Marshall Islands, having
listened to the various statements made by the
Government of the United States to the Security
Council in recent weeks, affirms its unity with the
United States of America and with its determination to
ensure that Iraq provides full cooperation and
compliance with its obligations under resolution 1441
(2002).

The Republic of the Marshall Islands takes
immense pride in its close relationship with the United
States, and continues to benefit greatly from the
generosity of that nation. The people of the Marshall
Islands have had personal experience with, and thus
have first-hand knowledge of, the extreme power and
devastating effects of weapons of mass destruction.
The devastation of war is evident to all of us. Our sons
and daughters now serving in the United States armed
forces are at the forefront of our thoughts, as they are
among those being placed in peril.

The Marshall Islands joins with others in
expressing the strong belief that the best hope for peace
and security lies in Iraq's full cooperation with the
inspection teams of the United Nations Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission and the
International Atomic Energy Agency and in full
compliance with Security Council resolution 1441
(2002).
