Mr. Gimolieca (Angola): Angola voted in
favour of resolution 2307 (2016), which approves the
Secretary-General's recommendations on the size,
operational aspects and mandate of a United Nations
mission in Colombia. We warmly welcome the signing,
on 24 August, of the Final Agreement between the
Government of Colombia and the Fuerzas Armadas
Revolucionarias de Colombia - Ejercito del Pueblo
(FARC-EP), putting an end to more than 50 years of
conflict.

We also welcome the recent report (S/2016/729)
of the Secretary-General and its recommendation
for deploying 450 unarmed observers and a civilian
component. We commend the efforts of the mediators
in the peace negotiations in Havana - Cuba, Norway,
Venezuela and Chile - for their manifold contributions
to peace and security in the region. We urge the two
sides to strive to implement the peace agreement and
wish the monitoring and verification mechanism every
success in its work with the Government and FARC-
EP in implementing the ceasefire and cessation of
hostilities.

Lastly, we call on the international community to
support the implementation of the peace agreement by
providing the financial and logistical assistance that the
Government of Colombia needs to ensure the success of
the peace process.
