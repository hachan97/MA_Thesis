The President (spoke in Chinese): I thank
Under-Secretary-General Ladsous for his additional
clarifications and the information he has provided.

Today's meeting has been a fruitful one. We had a
useful discussion with the Force Commanders and the
chief military observers on the state and experience
and improvement of peacekeeping operations. This is
of positive significance for improving the effectiveness
and efficiency of peacekeeping operations.

Peacekeeping operations are among the most
important means at the disposal of the United Nations
for carrying out its responsibilities for the maintenance
of international peace and security. Blue Helmets have
become the symbol ofthe United Nations. Moreover, for
people in conflict areas, Blue Helmets signify security
and hope. Peacekeepers work in harsh, complicated and
dangerous conditions. They have overcome enormous
difficulties to carry out the mandates of the Security
Council and to provide peace and a future for peoples
in conflict zones. Their achievements are extraordinary
and they are the embodiment of the spirit of the Charter
of the United Nations.

Before I conclude, allow me once again, on behalf
of the Security Council, to express our heartfelt
gratitude to all the Force Commanders, the senior
military observers present and all peacekeepers around
the world. I pay the highest tribute to them for their
courage, perseverance and dedication. I wish them all
the best.

There are no more names inscribed on the list of
speakers. The Security Council has thus concluded
the present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 1 pm.
