Mr. Barros Melet (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): We
express our satisfaction at the adoption of resolution
2231 (2015), by which the Security Council endorses
the agreement reached between Iran and the E3/EU+3
on the Iranian nuclear programme. We voted in favour
of the resolution because we value the agreement, as it
contributes to resolving differences on the programme's
scope and prospects and reaffirms the right of all States
party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons to benefit from the peaceful uses of nuclear
energy.

We hope that the significant verification elements
in the agreement will make it possible to build
confidence among the parties, preserve the integrity of
the multilateral non-proliferation regime and strengthen
the role of the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA), thereby promoting greater cooperation to
safeguard peace and stability in the Middle East.

The agreement has served to reaffirm the
irreplaceable value of negotiation and diplomacy in
conducting international relations. The responsibility,
flexibility and creativity that all the parties
demonstrated show the will and commitment to peace
and cooperation, which are the guiding principles of
our Organization.

At this historic juncture, from our seat in the
Council and on the Board of Governors of the IAEA,
we will provide our full support to the effective and
smooth implementation of this agreement. We therefore
hope to contribute to building confidence and creating
better conditions for the maintenance of regional and
global security.
