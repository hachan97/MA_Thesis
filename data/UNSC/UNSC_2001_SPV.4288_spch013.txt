The President: I should like to note in particular
the important remarks made by the representative of
Algeria. Of course, it is the primary responsibility of
the Security Council to act promptly and in a timely
manner to address crises in Africa.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Egypt. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
