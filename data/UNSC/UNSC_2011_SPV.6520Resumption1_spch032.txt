Mr. Seruhere (United Republic of Tanzania):
Mr. President, thank you for convening this meeting.
The United Republic of Tanzania is pleased to see
Colombia preside over the Security Council and host
deliberations on the situation in the Middle East, in
particular the question of Palestine. We commend the
commitment and efficiency with which you are leading
the deliberations.

The Security Council decided in 1948 to create
two States, Palestine and Israel, co-existing in peace in
some part of the Middle East. However, politics, group
interests and individual acrimony eventually led to the
disintegration of the United Nations arrangement. The
Cold War served only to exacerbate the situation.

Since 1948, a lot of statements have been made in
the Council urging it to rectify the situation, to no
avail. Must we continue talking endlessly as if no one
is listening? The situation in the Middle East situation
and question of Palestine were created by human
beings, using the Security Council. The issues can also
be solved by human beings using the same Council or
any other means of their choice at their disposal.

We cannot afford to say that the Security Council
has failed to solve the Palestinian question. We are all
aware that discontent causes conflict and that conflict
has by-products that we cannot always predict and
which we do not always like. In any conflict, the
parties involved lose property and lives. Let us
therefore think not only of war and conquest; let us
also think of making durable peace and go for it.

The Quartet elaborated a Road Map that would
lead to a two-State solution of Palestine and Israel
living with each other in peace. I believe that the
Council has not failed to pursue this option. Let the
Security Council pledge to us and vow that, at its next
meeting, it will tell us about results, and not about
work in progress.
