Mr. Laro (Nigeria): I thank the Chair of the
Committee established pursuant to resolution 1737
(2006), Ambassador Gary Quinlan, for his presentation
of the 90-day report of the Committee.

We note that the Committee has continued its
consideration of the reported case of the interdiction
in the Red Sea of a vessel carrying conventional arms
allegedly loaded in Iran. We would like to encourage
Iran to respond to the Committee's request for comments
on the issue in order to facilitate its work.

We are pleased to note that member States continue
to seek guidance from the Committee on notification
requirements and proposals for possible cooperation
with Iranian companies, including the provision of
technical assistance to Iran. That shows a willingness
on the part of member States to comply with the
sanctions regime.

Finally, we commend Ambassador Quinlan for
his astute leadership of the Committee and the Panel
of Experts for their hard work in the pursuit of their
mandate.
