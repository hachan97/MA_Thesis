Mr. Bolton (United States of America): This has
been a historic day. Not only have we unanimously
adopted resolution 1695 (2006) but North Korea has
set a world record in rejecting it within 45 minutes of
its adoption.

I could also say in the light of some of the
comments made by the representative of North Korea
before he left the Chamber, that I could exercise the
right of reply on behalf of the United States; but on the
other hand, why bother?
