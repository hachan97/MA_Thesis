Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Japan, Myanmar and Singapore, in
which they request to be invited to participate in the
consideration of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the consideration of the item, without
the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Swe
(Myanmar) took a seat at the Council table;
Mr. Takasu (Japan) and Mr. Menon (Singapore)
took the seats reservedfor them at the side of the
Council Chamber

The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Ibrahim Gambari,
Special Envoy of the Secretary-General.

It is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

I now give the floor to Mr. Ibrahim Gambari,
Special Envoy of the Secretary-General.
