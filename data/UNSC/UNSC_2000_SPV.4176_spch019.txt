Mr. Hamer (Netherlands): The delegation of
France, which currently holds the presidency of the
European Union, is inscribed to speak on behalf of the
European Union in today's important debate. My
delegation will not, therefore, speak in its national
capacity on this occasion. We wholeheartedly endorse
the important points to be raised in the intervention by
the representative of France.
