Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
should like to begin by congratulating you, Sir, on your
assumption of the presidency of the Council this
month. I am confident that, under your excellent
leadership, the Security Council will successfully
complete its work. I wish also to thank Ambassador
Pleuger and the German delegation for the outstanding
work they did during the German presidency last
month. Let me also thank the Assistant Secretary-
General, Mr. Tiirk, for his informative briefing on the
latest developments in the Bougainville peace process.
We appreciate the work done by the United Nations
Observer Mission in Bougainville (UNOMB).

Since the signing of the Bougainville Peace
Agreement, major progress has been achieved in the
Bougainville peace process, which is now at a crucial
juncture. The parties to the Peace Agreement have
accomplished a great deal in terms of collecting and
destroying weapons, and the process will soon be
completed.

The Bougainville Constitution has already
reached the phase of final consultations and drafting
and will soon be submitted to the Government of Papua
New Guinea for approval. These positive developments
are very encouraging.

China appreciates the political goodwill
demonstrated by the Government of Papua New
Guinea and by other parties to the Bougainville peace
process. We hope that all parties will continue their
efforts fully to implement the Peace Agreement and to
achieve, as soon as possible, lasting peace and stability
in Bougainville.

We support UNOMB's continued monitoring and
implementation of the Peace Agreement with a View to
ensuring the success of the Bougainville peace process.
We also appeal to the United Nations agencies
concerned and to donor countries to provide assistance
in the framework of the post-conflict reconstruction of
Bougainville and to help the local authorities in the
area of capacity-building and accelerate the
reintegration of ex-combatants.
