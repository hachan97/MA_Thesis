The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Mr. Koenigs for his briefing.

Before opening the floor to speakers, I wish to
request all participants to limit their statements, as far
as possible, to no more than five minutes in order to
enable the Council to work efficiently within its
timetable. I thank you for your understanding and
cooperation in this regard.
