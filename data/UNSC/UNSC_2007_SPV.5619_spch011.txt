Nana Effah-Apenteng (Ghana): As an elected
member of the Security Council, Ghana is highly
sensitive to the need to respect the jurisdiction and
competence of each organ of the United Nations. We
recognize that only an orderly and disciplined United
Nations can carry out effectively and impartially the
mandate entrusted to it by the Charter.

Ghana was mindful of all that when, after careful
consideration, we decided to vote in favour of the
inscription of the situation in Myanmar on the agenda
of the Security Council. Indeed, we are of the view that
the maintenance of international peace and security in
today's radically changed world necessarily involves
addressing complex challenges that are cross-cutting
and interrelated. We believe that there is no other route
to a peaceful and secure world built on freedom, justice
and prosperity for all.

In that regard, we are also convinced that the
interests of humankind can best be served by the
United Nations when the various organs and subsidiary
bodies are more devoted to complementing each
others' efforts. We should not overlook the fact that, in
recent times, this Council has dealt with many intra-
State conflicts. Above all, in their endeavours, the
various United Nations organs must never lose sight of
the underlying principles and objectives enshrined in
the United Nations Charter and the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.

It is for those reasons that Ghana voted in favour
of the draft resolution urging the military authorities in
Myanmar to cooperate with the Secretary-General's
good offices and open up the political space for
an inclusive national dialogue among all stakeholders.
That is the only way to bring an end to the situation in
Myanmar. We hope that the authorities in Myanmar
will respond positively to the minimal requirements of
peace, as outlined in the rejected draft resolution.
