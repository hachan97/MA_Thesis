Mr. Burleigh (United States of America): On this
sorrowful occasion, the United States is honoured to join
with the Governments of Kenya and the United Republic
of Tanzania in introducing this resolution on the tragic
and indiscriminate terrorist bombings at the American
embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. President
Clinton and Secretary Albright have conveyed the

 

condolences of the people of the United States to the
families and loved ones of the hundreds who lost their lives
and the thousands who were injured in both Kenya and
Tanzania in these cowardly terrorist acts. To the
Governments of Kenya and the United Republic of
Tanzania, we have offered the support of the United States
in dealing with this tragedy, meeting their needs and
working jointly and cooperatively with them to find the
perpetrators.
The incidents of 7 August underscore that terrorists
know no boundaries and that the suppression of
international terrorism and the arrest, conviction and
punishment of its perpetrators are essential to the
maintenance of international peace and security.

The United States will not be intimidated by
terrorism and will never forget its victims. We will spare
no effort and use all the means at our disposal to track
down and punish the perpetrators of these outrageous
acts. We call upon all Member States to support the
ongoing investigations and to apprehend the perpetrators
if found on their territory, as called for in the Convention
on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against
Internationally Protected Persons.
