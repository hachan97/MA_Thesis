The President (spoke in Spanish): 1 thank Mr. De
Mistura for his comprehensive and detailed briefing.

I would request members of the Security Council
and those joining us in the Chamber to remember to
turn off their cell phones and please focus on those
taking the floor.

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council wishing to make statements.
