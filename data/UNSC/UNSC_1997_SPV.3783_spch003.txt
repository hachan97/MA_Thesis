The President: I thank the representative of the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia for the kind words
he addressed to me.

It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
(S/ 1997/405) before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall
put the draft resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Chile, China, Costa Rica, Egypt, France, Guinea-
Bissau, Japan, Kenya, Poland, Portugal, Republic of
Korea, Russian Federation, Sweden, United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of
America

The President: There were 15 votes in favour. The
draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as resolution
1 l 10 (1997).

I shall now call on those members of the Council who
wish to make statements following the voting.
