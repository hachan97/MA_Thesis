The President (interpretation from Spanish): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Angola and Portugal, in which they
request to be invited to participate in the discussion of the
item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the discussion,
without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Van Dunem
"Mbinda" (Angola) took a seat at the Council table;
Mr. Monteiro (Portugal) took the seat reserved for
him at the side of the Council Chamber.

The President (interpretation from Spanish): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them document
S/ 1999/27, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by Brazil, Canada, Gabon, Malaysia, Namibia,
Portugal and the Russian Federation.

It is my understanding that the Security Council is
ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before
it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council who
wish to make statements before the voting.
