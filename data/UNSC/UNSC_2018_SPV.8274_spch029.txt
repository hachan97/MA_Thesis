Mr. Danon (Israel): With regard to the statement
by the representative of Bolivia, he speaks very
passionately, but he should check the facts of the names
he mentions in the Security Council. We fact-checked
the names he mentioned and found that they were the
names of members of Hamas. Every time he mentions
a name in the Council, we will check to see if it is the
name of a member of Hamas. But I would like to ask
him today ifhe is willing to condemn Hamas for its acts
of terror. He speaks very passionately about everything,
but we want to hear that condemnation directed at
Hamas. Is he able to do that? Is the Kuwaiti Ambassador
even able to pronounce the word "Hamas"? We expect
him to be brave enough to condemn Hamas here today.
