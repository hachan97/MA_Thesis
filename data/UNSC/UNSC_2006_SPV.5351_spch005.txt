The President: I thank the President of the
Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the kind
words he spoke about my country, and in particular
about the late President Nyerere, the founder of the
Tanzanian nation, and about my compatriot
Ambassador Salim Ahmed Salim, who was President
of the Security Council exactly 30 years ago, in
January 1976, a month after he received East Timor's
Foreign Minister in December 1975.
