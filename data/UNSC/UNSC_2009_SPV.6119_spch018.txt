The President (spoke in Russian): I shall now
make a statement in my national capacity.

We are grateful to the Representative of the
Secretary-General, Ms. Karin Landgren, for submitting
the report on the United Nations Mission in Nepal
(UNMIN) (S/2009/221) and for briefing us on recent
developments in that country. We support the efforts of
Ms. Landgren. We are pleased that the report welcomes
the progress achieved in key areas of the Nepalese
peace process. A serious discussion of developing a
draft constitution and determining the future of the two
armies has begun. The Special Committee on the
integration and rehabilitation of Maoist army personnel
has started regular consultations. A Constitutional
Council and a National Security Council have been
formed and have begun to establish local peace
committees.

At the same time, we regret that, against that
positive backdrop, in recent days negative trends have
emerged in Nepal that are threatening the peace
process. In the current situation, it is essential that all
political forces in the country do their utmost to
promptly resolve by consensus existing disputes on the
basis of a political dialogue. We are confident that
UNMIN, within its mandate, will provide the necessary
support to the Nepalese for them to promptly overcome
their problems. We will follow developments in that
country.

I now resume my functions as president of the
Council.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Nepal.
