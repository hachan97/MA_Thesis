Mr. Rugunda (Uganda): I would just like to say
that we salute everybody for supporting the British-
sponsored resolution on Somalia, as well as to say that
the African Union would like to see the Council take
even stronger measures against those elements who are
sponsoring rebellion and terrorist activities in Somalia.
Also, the African Union pledges to continue to provide
unequivocal support to the Council so that the problem
of Somalia can at long last come to a speedy end.

My last comment is that the situation in
Mogadishu has been very bad. But I am happy to say
that the Government is now pushing the rebels from
sectors of Mogadishu. We expect that the current trend
of pushing the rebels away from Mogadishu and
towards eventual defeat will continue.
