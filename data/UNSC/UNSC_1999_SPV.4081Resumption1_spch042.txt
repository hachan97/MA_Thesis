The President: I thank the representative of Norway
for the kind words he addressed to me.

Let me thank my colleagues in the European Union
who will be addressing the Council, who have agreed to
limit their contributions to two minutes, which is very good
of them. It does not imply any lesser contribution to
Africa's interests.

The next speaker is the representative of Indonesia. I
invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make
his statement.
