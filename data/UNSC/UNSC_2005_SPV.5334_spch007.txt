Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
At the outset, the Chinese delegation would like to
thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General, Mr. Mwakawago, for his briefing. Today's
briefing could be Mr. Mwakawago's last to the
Council. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to him
and his team for their important role in helping Sierra
Leone achieve peace and stability.

The United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone
(UNAMSIL) is about to leave the land of diamonds.
Over the past six years, the Blue Helmets have worked
with the Sierra Leone Government and the
international community, so that Sierra Leone could
emerge from its war and embark on the road of post-
conflict reconstruction.

Today, in Sierra Leone, basic stability has been
achieved, the national authority has been extended
throughout the country, and economic recovery has
made significant headway. Those encouraging
achievements can be attributed to the efforts of
UNAMSIL. The Mission also implemented numerous
innovative approaches, including an exit strategy based
on benchmarks, the concept of an integrated mission
and a coordination mechanism for subregional
peacekeeping forces. Those approaches will, no doubt,
provide useful lessons for other peacekeeping
operations.

As the Secretary-General points out in his latest
report, many challenges lie ahead in the reconstruction
of Sierra Leone. We urge the international community
to continue to provide Sierra Leone with the assistance
it needs to promote lasting peace and development.
The United Nations Integrated Office in Sierra Leone
is soon to be established, and we hope that it will begin
to function efficiently and according to schedule.

We are confident that through joint efforts by the
Sierra Leone Government and the international
community, Sierra Leone will have a bright future
ahead of it.
