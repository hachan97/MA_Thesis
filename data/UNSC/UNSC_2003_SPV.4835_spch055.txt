The President: There are no further speakers
inscribed on my list.

I thank all those who contributed to the
ministerial discussion and all those who have
contributed today. I am conscious of the breadth of the
challenge, the amount of work which has been
identified and, indeed, of the number of different
organs and agencies of the United Nations that are
involved in this subject in one way or the other. The
Secretary-General's report, which he will issue in due
course, will be a response on behalf of the United
Nations family to these issues. We very much envisage
that this will be substantive and practical. It will
address some of these issues, so that, in principle,
taking a country coming out of conflict towards the
restoration of the rule of law will be facilitated by the
work that we have started.

But we have only started it in the Security
Council in the past week. We have been reminded of all
the other work that is going on and part of the
challenge will be to bring that together so that there is
a more coherent approach. Anyone wishing to submit
comments in writing is very welcome to do so. The
presidency will now reflect on what it can do to help
further the work and may well issue a note under its
own responsibility, trying to pull some of this together.

It would be remiss of me at the end of a month if
I did not thank colleagues for their cooperation and the
Secretariat for its assistance, especially the services of
the interpreters and the security personnel, which have
been an indispensable help to the presidency.

The meeting rose at 1.40 pm.
