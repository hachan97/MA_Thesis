Mr. Grauls (Belgium) (spoke in French): First of
all, I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for
organizing this debate. I should also like to thank
Minister Stubb for the briefing he has given us, as the
Chairman-in-Office, on the work of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). I
08-52321
would also like to assure him of Belgium's full support
for his efforts to promote the agenda of the OSCE.

As a regional organization under Chapter VIII of
the Charter of the United Nations, the OSCE continues
to be an important regional stakeholder. With its unique
concept of security ~ which includes the political,
military, economic, environmental and human
dimensions - and its presence in the field, the OSCE
is continuing to play a concrete stabilizing role in the
region.

It is of course impossible not to refer to the
situation in Georgia. Belgium would like to thank the
Chairman-in-Office and the entire OSCE for their
efforts to pacify the situation. In that connection, I
would like to refer in particular to the 19 August
agreement to deploy 100 additional observers to areas
adjacent to South Ossetia, in addition to the eight
observers in South Ossetia, 20 of whom were
immediately sent to Georgia.

In that regard, Belgium very much regrets that it
was not possible to achieve an agreement among
participating States on the modalities for the
deployment of the additional OSCE observers. That
has prevented the dispatching of the 80 remaining
additional observers at this stage, as initially planned.

Furthermore, Belgium believes that the OSCE,
together with other stakeholders, such as the European
Union and the United Nations, will have an important
role to play in the upcoming discussions to be held in
Geneva.

Belgium would like to thank the Chairman-in-
Office for his briefing. We wish him every success for
the ministerial meeting to be held in Helsinki. I assure
him of Belgium's full support.
