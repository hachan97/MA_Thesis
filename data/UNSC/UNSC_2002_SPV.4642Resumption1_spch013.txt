The President (spoke in Chinese): I thank the
representative of Cameroon for the kind words he
addressed to me and to my country. I should also like
to thank him for pledging to the Chinese delegation his
full support and cooperation. My ability to succeed as
President of the Council during November rests on the
excellent groundwork laid in October.
