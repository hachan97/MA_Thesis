Mr. Lacroix: I will try to answer the question posed
by the representative of the United Kingdom regarding
the situation of camps in relation to the Rapid Support
Forces (RSF). I can say that the African Union-United
Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) has
not been in a position to verify that the RSF have
vacated the camps that have already been handed over
by UNAMID. That is essentially because its interaction
with the Transitional Military Council has been quite
limited over the past month. What we have, as I said,
is a commitment by the Transitional Military Council,
and I have just heard the Ambassador of the Sudan
reiterating that commitment, that all camps that have
been handed over will be used for civilian purposes. We
certainly look forward to the Government of the Sudan
delivering on that commitment.

With regard to the camps that need to be, but have
not yet been, handed over by UNAMID, we also look
forward to productive discussions with the Government.
As I said, UNAMID is currently working on a road
map regarding site-by-site arrangements in that spirit.
I believe that the tripartite mechanism that is to be held
in New York to which I alluded will also be very helpful
for us to advance on this very important issue.
