Mr. Dejammet (France) (interpretation from French): Naturally I would like to express my complete
confidence in what we are sure will be the successful
results of your presidency, Sir, and our great appreciation
of the way in which the Council's work last month was
conducted under the presidency of the Permanent
Representative of China.

The United Nations Preventive Deployment Force
(UNPREDEP) is a success. Its work has helped keep the
crises in the Balkan region from spilling over into the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The success of
this mission demonstrates the importance of a United
Nations operation in preventing the outbreak of some
conflicts. The example of UNPREDEP can thus prove
useful in avoiding the spread of crises in other parts of
the world, especially in Africa, where the need for
preventive deployment by the United Nations is in many
cases every bit as justified as in the case of the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

France shares the opinion expressed by the
Secretary-General in his last report on the need to
maintain UNPREDEP'S presence. Admittedly, the
situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
and in the region is more encouraging in some areas
today. However, there are still causes for concern,
particularly in the light of risks linked to the Kosovo
situation.

When the time comes, the modalities of the
international presence in the former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia will probably have to be adapted to take
account of developments within both the country and the
region. However, this should not be rushed into. The
time-frame in the draft resolution seems, under the
circumstances, appropriate.

For all these reasons, France will vote in favour of
the draft resolution.
