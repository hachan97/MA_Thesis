The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have just received letters
from the representatives of Pakistan, South Africa and
Viet Nam, in which they request to be invited to
participate in the consideration of the item on the
Council's agenda. In accordance with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
consideration without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The representatives of Pakistan, South Africa and
Viet Nam took the seats reserved for them at the
side ofthe Council Chamber.
