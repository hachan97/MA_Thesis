The President: I thank Ambassador Lyall Grant
for his briefing.

On behalf of the Council, I should like to express
appreciation to all the members of the Security Council
and the Secretariat who participated in the mission for
the manner in which they discharged their important
responsibilities on behalf of the Council.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 10.45 a.m.
