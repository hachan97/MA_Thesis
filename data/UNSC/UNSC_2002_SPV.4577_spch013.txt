The President: I thank Mr. Guehenno for his
very kind comments about the role that the United
Kingdom played. I thank him for the honesty and
frankness of the assessment that he made and his very
constructive comments in terms of solutions.

Mr. Guehenno, I was struck by the importance
you gave to the clarity of the mandate and to
coordination and the implications of that for the
management of the operation overall. In that context, I
would like to ask you about the relationship between
the United Nations political, military and humanitarian
wings, because it has been different in Sierra Leone,
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and
Afghanistan. It is now a live issue in Angola. Should
we be looking for a single model, or should we be
developing and learning from each of the countries and
adapting to each context?

My other question relates to the point you made
very early on, which was about the urgency which was
introduced into the process after the recognition that
the credibility of the United Nations was at stake.
Collectively, as the Security Council, what can we do
to get that sense of urgency into the situation at an
earlier stage in the process, without getting to the point
where we think the credibility of the United Nations is
at stake?
