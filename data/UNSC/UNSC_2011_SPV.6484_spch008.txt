Mr. Li Baodong (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China voted in favor of the draft resolution drawn up
by Arab States on the Israeli settlements. We deeply
regret that the draft resolution was not adopted.

China has always firmly supported the just cause
of the Palestinian people to gain legitimate national
rights. At present, Israel continues to build settlements,
which has become a major obstacle to mutual trust and
the resumption of peace talks between Palestine and
Israel.

China resolutely opposes Israel's construction of
settlements and the separation wall in the occupied
Palestinian territory, including the West Bank and East
Jerusalem. We firmly support the legitimate demands
of the Palestinian people. China has always maintained
that, on the basis of the relevant United Nations
resolutions, the principle of land for peace, the Arab
Peace Initiative and the Road Map to Middle East
peace, Palestine and Israel should conduct dialogue
and negotiations to settle differences so as to ultimately
establish an independent State of Palestine, with the
two countries living side by side in peace.

China supports the Security Council playing its
due role in the Middle East peace process. We also
hope that the Quartet meeting to be held on the
question of the Middle East will achieve a positive
outcome and will help break the stalemate in the
Middle East process.
