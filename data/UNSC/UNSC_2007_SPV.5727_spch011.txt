Mr. Spatafora (Italy): Italy, as a sponsor of the
present resolution, is particularly pleased with the
strong message that has been sent through the
unanimous adoption of this very important resolution.
We express our strong appreciation to the Secretary-
General for the crucial role that he has played over
these months in bringing us to this point. He has shown
strong determination and a very clear political vision.

This resolution represents not the conclusion, but
rather the beginning, of the international community's
new commitment. The true challenge is now the
implementation of the resolution. We therefore trust in
the cooperation of all interested parties, in particular
the Sudan Government.

Let us not underestimate the challenges lying
ahead of us. This will be the largest current
peacekeeping operation in Africa, and it will also be
the most expensive for the United Nations. We must all
be willing to do our part.

The peacekeeping force represents an essential
component of the international action aimed at
restoring peace in Darfur. However, a sustainable
solution to the conflict, as has been stated, can only be
political. To that end, we wish to reaffirm our utmost
support for the efforts to re-energize the political
process being conducted by the envoys of the United
Nations and the African Union, Jan Eliasson and Salim
Ahmed Salim. In that context, our hope is that the
upcoming meeting in Arusha will see the participation
of all major rebel movements, leading to a shared
platform for the subsequent negotiations with the
Khartoum Government.

Let us always be well aware of the crucial
relevance of the other two tracks of our comprehensive
approach: the humanitarian and development tracks,
which are central in helping to create the conditions for
sustainable peace in the region.
