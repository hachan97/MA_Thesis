The President: I again wish to remind all
speakers to limit their statements to no more than four
minutes, in order to enable the Council to carry out its
work expeditiously. I would also like to remind
delegations with longer statements that they may
circulate them in writing.

I now give the floor to the representative of Costa
Rica.
