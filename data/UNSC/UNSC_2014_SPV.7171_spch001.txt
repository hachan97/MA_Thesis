The President: In accordance with rule 39 of
the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite
Mr. Abou Moussa, Special Representative of the
Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations
Regional Office for Central Africa, to participate in
this meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2014/3l9, which contains the report of
the Secretary-General on the activities of the United
Nations Regional Office for Central Africa and on the
Lord's Resistance Army-affected areas.

I now give the floor to Mr. Moussa.
