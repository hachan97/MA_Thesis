Mr. De La Sabliere (France) (spoke in French):
France voted in favour of the draft resolution submitted
by Algeria, Pakistan and Tunisia. The text called for
the immediate cessation of Israeli military operations
in the north of the Gaza Strip. It also included a
condemnation of acts of terror and reaffirmed the need
for the speedy implementation of the road map. Those
two factors were essential, in our View, and ensured
that the text was balanced. We consider it crucial that
the Council react rapidly to the continuing
deterioration in the situation in the north of the Gaza
Strip and appeal to reason.

France acknowledges the right of Israel to defend
itself against the heinous terrorist acts perpetrated
against its people, but it must do so in strict
compliance with international law. The toll in human
lives, which is increasing daily, and the material
damage resulting from the ongoing operation in Gaza,
are unjustifiable. France regrets that, once again, the
Council has been paralysed on this issue that is pivotal
to international peace and security.
