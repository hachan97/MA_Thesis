Ms. Kamara (Liberia): I did not come prepared
to make a statement, but I think the least that I can do
is, through the Council, to express our appreciation for
the support that has been provided to Liberia over time
by the peacekeeping Mission and by the continued
extension of its mandate and presence.

I also want to express our appreciation to troop-
contributing countries that have deployed their forces
in Liberia and constitute the mainstay of peace and
security, as the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General has stated. I also want to thank her for the
exceptional guidance that she is providing to the
peacekeeping Mission.

Liberia appreciates all the support that it is
receiving. The Government is making tremendous
efforts to move forward with the rehabilitation and
reconstruction programmes. I would like to confirm
what the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General has said to the effect that, while we are
grateful for what has been provided, continuous
support is indeed needed. We are hopeful that placing
Liberia on the agenda of the Peacebuilding
Commission will give further impetus to the efforts
that are taking place on the ground.

I would again like to thank the President for the
opportunity to participate in this meeting.
