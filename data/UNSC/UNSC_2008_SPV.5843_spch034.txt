Mr. Guehenno: At this late hour, I just wish first
to place on record the gratitude of the United Nations
for the strong commitment of the international
community to Timor-Leste, which has been so much in
evidence during this meeting. We greatly appreciate
the support of the Security Council. We greatly
appreciate the support of the neighbours and of all
those nations that have spoken this morning and that
are so critical to the provision of security as well as
development aid to Timor-Leste.

I noted during this meeting how many speakers
stressed the importance of political dialogue and
consensus in Timor-Leste. Indeed, that dialogue was
spearheaded by President Ramos-Horta himself during
those meetings of 17 January and 7 February that I
mentioned in my briefing. Such political dialogue
really is the foundation for the solution both of the
short-term issues that we have discussed this morning,
such as the internally displaced persons, the petitioners
and the fugitives, and of the longer-term challenges,
such as security sector reform, the strengthening of the
judiciary, and also, of course, as many speakers have
stressed, the socio-economic challenges facing Timor-
Leste. It is therefore very encouraging to see such a
strong consensus here on what is needed in Timor-
Leste to continue our partnership with that country.
