Mr. Burian (Slovakia): Slovakia, as one of the
sponsors of the resolution, voted in favour of it and
welcomes its adoption by the Council.

Slovakia remains convinced that the situation on
the ground in Darfur requires quick and robust action
by the international community to stop an upsurge in
violence against civilians and to facilitate the
implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement. In that
respect, the Security Council has the moral duty and
responsibility to act without delay to prevent an
escalation of the crisis, which would have dire
consequences not only for Darfur, but for the entire
region.

We believe that the resolution provides an
important basis for addressing the urgent problems of a
deteriorating situation in Darfur, including through an
immediate strengthening of the African Union Mission
in the Sudan and, subsequently, through a transition to
a United Nations-led operation. In our view, such an
operation is the best available option to cope with the
complex challenges facing Darfur and to facilitate the
peace process, leading to a lasting and sustainable
solution to the crisis in Darfur.

Slovakia believes that, with the adoption of this
resolution, the international community will continue
to be very closely engaged with the Government of the
Sudan in a constructive dialogue on ensuring the full
implementation of resolution 1706 (2006) and
resolving the crisis in Darfur in general, while fully
respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
the country. We expect the Government of the Sudan to
comply with the provisions of today's resolution and
thus to help to end the Darfur crisis in the best interests
of all Sudanese people.
