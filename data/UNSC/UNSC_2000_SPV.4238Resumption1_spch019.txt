The President: I thank the representative of
Guinea for his short, focused statement, again
reminding us of the importance of implementing the
Brahimi report.

The next speaker is the Executive Secretary of the
Community of Portuguese-Speaking countries,
Mrs. Dulce Maria Pereira, to whom the Council has
extended an invitation under rule 39 of its provisional
rules of procedure. I invite her to take a seat at the
Council table and to make her statement.
