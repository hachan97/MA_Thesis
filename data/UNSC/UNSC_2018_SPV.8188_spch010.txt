Mr. Van Oosterom (Netherlands): On Wednesday,
during the high-level debate on the Charter of the
United Nations, I quoted one of the founding fathers
of the United Nations, Ambassador Stettinius (see S/PV.8185). He said that the members of the Security
Council had the obligation to agree so that the Council
may be able to act and act effectively. Today we finally
managed to agree to end the atrocious violence in
eastern Ghouta; to end attacks against hospitals; and to
end the killing of innocent civilians, including women
and children.

The Kingdom of the Netherlands welcomes the
unanimous adoption of this crucial resolution - resolution
2401 (2018). Let me thank the co-penholders in
particular - Kuwait and Sweden - for their tireless
efforts and skilled diplomatic work. We pay tribute
to them.

Today we have a resolution, now we need to see
action on the ground. All United Nations States Members
have an obligation to make sure that the words of the
resolution are implemented without delay. The Syrian
authorities in particular have a specific responsibility
towards their own people. The resolution means that
all parties must cease hostilities without delay. All
parties must engage immediately for a sustainable and
durable humanitarian pause of at least 30 consecutive
days throughout Syria to enable the safe, unimpeded
and sustained delivery of humanitarian aid and services
and to enable medical evacuations of the critically
sick and wounded, in accordance with applicable
international law.

The implementation of the resolution means the
cessation ofhostilities, the delivery ofhumanitarian aid
and urgent medical evacuations. It is a first step in the
right direction, but much more is needed - a political
solution, accountability and the return of refugees. The
Council should remain seized of the matter and closely
monitor the implementation of the resolution, starting
today. The Council should reconvene without delay if
the situation demands it.
