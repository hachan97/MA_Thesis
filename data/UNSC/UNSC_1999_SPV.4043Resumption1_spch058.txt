Mr. Pal (India): As a neighbour of Indonesia, and a
country which has very close ties with it, we thank you
Mr. President, for this opportunity to speak to the Council
today on the situation in East Timor, which is both tragic
and complex. I will not presume to preach to the
Government of Indonesia about civilized or responsible
behaviour. Indonesia is an ancient civilization; no one
would be more troubled or more shamed by what is
happening in East Timor than the Indonesians themselves
or wish more urgently to put an end to it.

We are deeply concerned that, following the popular
consultations in East Timor - which, we must not forget,
were made possible by Indonesia's cooperation - there
has been such appalling Violence there over the last few
days. We deplore the killings and the intimidation that
have taken place. Clearly, the immediate need is to
restore law and order.

In circumstances which are, equally clearly, very
difficult, the Indonesian authorities have said that they
will do everything possible to discharge their
responsibility to maintain security in East Timor. They
have imposed martial law, and they are trying to move
with a sense of urgency to do what needs to be done to
prevent further violence. This must be recognized. In
these trying times they need the encouragement and
support of the international community. We hope and
trust that the Indonesian authorities will quickly be able
to bring the situation under control and create conditions
under which the security and the well-being of all
sections of the population in East Timor will be assured.

 

In our view, action by the United Nations must
continue to be in the framework of the understandings
worked out between the Government of Indonesia and the
United Nations, and any peacekeeping force must be
accepted by the Indonesian authorities and approved by the
Security Council.
