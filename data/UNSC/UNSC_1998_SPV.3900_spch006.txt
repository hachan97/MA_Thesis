Mr. Lavrov (Russian Federation)(interpretation from Russian): Moscow received with alarm the news of the
decision of the Government of Israel to expand the
municipal borders of Jerusalem, which would link
Jerusalem to a number of major Israeli settlements on the
West Bank of the River Jordan. We share the international
community's negative reaction to this ill-advised and ill-
timed Israeli measure and to other settlement activities
undertaken by the Israeli authorities.

 

In the light of the gravity of the situation, Russia
supported the request of the Group of Arab States for an
urgent discussion of this question at a formal meeting of
the Security Council. Israel's decision further complicates
the Middle East peace process negotiations, particularly
in the context of the ongoing highly complex phase of
drawing up a mutually acceptable formula for the next
round of redeployment of the Israeli army in the West
Bank.

Unilateral acts against and violations of the status
quo in East Jerusalem run counter to norms of
international law, contradict the concluded Palestinian-
Israeli agreements and are unacceptable in the context of
the foundations of the Middle East peace process insofar
as they are not in keeping with the which maintains that
Jerusalem's fate will be the subject of final status talks
between the Palestinians and the Israelis. Such acts are
aimed at changing the demographic composition of the
city and at altering its geographic and historical borders.

Russia, as one of the sponsors of the peace process,
once again calls upon the Government of Israel to
demonstrate a constructive approach to a settlement with
its Arab neighbours and to refrain from resorting to
unilateral administrative measures in the occupied
territories, including East Jerusalem, which can cast a pall
on the prospects for negotiations.

We are convinced that the Security Council will take
a stand in favour of a speedy resolution of the problems
relating to East Jerusalem, which will ensure progress in
the peace process and respond to the aspirations of the
peoples of the Middle East.
