Mrs. Alhright (United States of America): This
resolution appropriately focuses on the future - on the
Council's expectations of the Government of Croatia and
the local Serb authorities. It acknowledges that the
Government of Croatia has taken important steps in the
signing of a status-of-forces agreement and in withdrawing
a notable portion of its troops from the zones of separation.
We understand that completion of this withdrawal is at
hand. The Serb forces for their part must withdraw and
must not occupy positions from which Croatian
Government forces have withdrawn.
We look forward to these and other actions by the
parties that will enable the United Nations Confidence
Restoration Operation in Croatia (UNCRO) to carry out its
mandate in full and that will create the conditions for a
resumption of progress towards the political resolution of
this conflict that was inexcusably interrupted by recent
actions of both parties.

We continue to believe that the only viable solution to
the conflict in the Republic of Croatia is a negotiated
settlement that will lead to the peaceful reintegration of the
other three sectors into Croatia. That process will be
immeasurably helped by Croatian Government actions that
will show the Croatian Serbs that they have nothing to fear
from reintegration.

We hope that, in the months ahead, the Croat and Serb
communities in Western Slavonia will re-establish the
bonds of friendship and mutual respect that existed before
the conflict began.
