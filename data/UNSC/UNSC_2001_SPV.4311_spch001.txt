The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Angola, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Mangueira
(Angola), took a seat at the Council table.

The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The Security Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2001/363, which contains a note dated 16
April 2001 by the President of the Security Council,
circulating the letter dated 16 April 2001 from the
Chairman of the Security Council Committee
established pursuant to resolution 864 (1993)
concerning the situation in Angola, enclosing the
addendum to the final report of the Monitoring
Mechanism on sanctions against UNITA, which has
been submitted pursuant to paragraph 6 of resolution
1336 (2001).

I call on the Ambassador of Ireland, Chairman of
the Security Council Committee established pursuant to
resolution 864 (1993) concerning the situation in
Angola, to update the Council on any remaining
adjustments to the draft resolution before us.
