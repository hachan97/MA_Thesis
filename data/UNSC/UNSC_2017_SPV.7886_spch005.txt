Mr. Alemu (Ethiopia): Let me say from the bottom
of my heart that the passing of Ambassador Vitaly
Churkin is a great tragedy, not just for his family
and Russia but for the Organization and multilateral
diplomacy, at a time when the United Nations is needed
more than ever. One need not delve into this at length.
These are not normal times. This is a period when we
need a person like Vitaly - a patriot for his country,
no doubt, but also a diplomat whom we could trust at
a time when that quality is not found in abundance. He
would never mislead you and was a person who allowed
space for mutual accommodation. One thing is very
clear - he left us a time when people like him are
needed the most. On behalf of my Government, 1 want
to express condolences to his family, his colleagues,
the United Nations family and the Government of the
Russian Federation.
