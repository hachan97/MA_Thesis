Mr. Pankin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation voted in favour of
resolution 2003 (2011). We believe that the African
Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur
(UNAMID) plays an important stabilizing role in that
region of the Sudan. The Russian Federation views
UNAMID as an integral component of a Darfur
settlement.

Significantly, the Mission's mandate includes a
broad set of political support tasks pertaining to the
11-43737
peace process and to the mediation efforts of the
African Union and the United Nations. These include
support for and monitoring of the implementation of
the Darfur peace agreements, and assistance in the
preparation and conduct of inter-Darfurian dialogue
and consultations.

On 14 July, the Government of the Sudan and the
Justice and Equality Movement signed the Doha
document for peace in Darfur, which we see as a very
important step towards a Darfur settlement. In chapter
7 of that document, the parties agreed to engage in
inter-Darfurian dialogue and stipulated that it should be
undertaken with the assistance of UNAMID, the
African Union and the Government of Qatar. The
political process is designed to build a broad platform
of civil society in Darfur for the implementation of the
agreements.

The need to launch the Darfur political process is
recognized in a resolution adopted by the African
Union Peace and Security Council on 19 July. Russia
fully supports that position. We believe that inter-
Darfurian dialogue is a core element of the new road
map for a peaceful settlement in Darfur, as called for in
resolution 2003 (2011).

We highly value UNAMID's activities and the
efforts of its head, Joint Special Representative
Gambari, to promote a settlement in Darfur. We believe
that, in the difficult conditions prevailing in Darfur, the
peacekeepers are doing their utmost to undertake the
tasks assigned to them by the Security Council. We call
on all parties in Darfur to support UNAMID's
activities.
