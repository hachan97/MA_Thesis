Mr. Pleuger (Germany): We, too, recognize the
presence of members of the families of the victims and
would like to express our sympathy with them. We
welcome the fact that compensation will be made
available to them after such a long delay.

We are relieved that Libya has fulfilled the
demands of the Security Council and thereby enabled
the definitive lifting of sanctions by the Security
Council. Libya has undertaken an important step to free
itself from the burdens of the past. A further important
step, however, remains to be taken. The victims and
surviving dependents of the attack of the La Belle
discotheque in Berlin have been waiting for
compensation for the past 17 years. As a reminder,
three people - two Americans and one Turkish
woman- were killed and 231 seriously wounded,
among them 56 American citizens. This was the
horrendous result of that bomb attack.

We welcome the initial indications of a
fundamental willingness on the part of Libya to
compensate victims of that attack as well. We call upon
Libya to reach an appropriate settlement with the
representatives of the victims and surviving dependents
without delay.
