Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
Syrian conflict has been going on for seven years,
which has led to large numbers of casualties among
innocent civilians. China would like to empathize with
the profound suffering of the Syrian people. The present
situation must not last any longer. Swift action must be
taken. We must resort to dialogue and consultations in

order to assure an appropriate solution. We must help
the Syrian people lift themselves out of suffering at
an early date, help Syria rebuild itself and ensure that
Syrians can lead peaceful and stable lives.

China has always advocated for dialogue and
consultations as the best means to resolve international
conflicts. All parties need to make efforts to prevent the
situation in Syria from further deteriorating. A political
solution is the only way out of the situation. A military
solution will not work. It would only exacerbate the
suffering of the Syrian people, further complicating the
situation in the region and making it more turbulent,
which is not in the common interests of Syria, countries
of the region or the international community.

China calls upon all relevant parties to firmly persist
in diplomatic efforts, insist on a political solution to the
situation in Syria through dialogue and consultations
and support the role of the United Nations, including
the efforts of Special Envoy De Mistura, as the main
channel of mediation and achieving progress in the
Geneva talks. We should therefore safeguard all efforts
to maintain the hard-won momentum for a political
solution to the Syrian question.

Recent days have brought about complications in
certain areas of Syria. The international community
must remain highly alert regarding such relevant
developments. We must stick to uniform criteria in
fighting against all terrorist organizations listed by the
Security Council.
