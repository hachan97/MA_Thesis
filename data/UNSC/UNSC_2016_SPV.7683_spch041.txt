Mr. Prystaiko (Ukraine): I will be brief. I will
not add to the attempts to impose more truths, half-
truths and lies that members of the Council have been
subjected to for quite a long time. If we are going into
such details, I would like to bring to the Council's
attention, including that of the Russian representative,
that when we speak of the so-called Minsk package of
measures, we seem to have forgotten about the initial
Minsk agreement, which was signed almost half a
year ago. Why have we forgotten about it? Because the
Russian Federation all the time refers only to the Minsk
agreement of 12 February. I must remind the Council
that the original Minsk agreement mentions the special
security area along the Ukrainian corridor monitored
by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe. If the Russian Federation is so fearful that the
Ukrainian forces will regain control over the territory
of Ukraine, I must remind the representative of the
Russian Federation that the idea, which was supported
by everyone, was that Ukrainian territory should be
returned to Ukraine. But before that, the area around
the Ukrainian-Russian border should be placed under
the monitoring and verification of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, thereby preventing
more weapons and more mercenaries from entering our
territory, a practice that we have repeatedly brought to
the attention of the Council.
