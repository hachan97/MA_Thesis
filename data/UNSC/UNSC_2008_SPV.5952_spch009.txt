Mr. La Yifan (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
listened carefully to the statements made by
Ambassador Alasania of Georgia and Ambassador
Churkin of the Russian Federation. The current
situation in South Ossetia, Georgia, is very worrisome.
China is gravely concerned about the military conflict
in the region. It is urgent that the parties achieve an
immediate ceasefire and refrain from any actions that
might escalate tensions. The parties to the conflict
should immediately resume dialogue and should
peacefully settle their dispute.
