The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina and
Luxembourg, in which they request to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

On behalf of the Council I extend a warm
welcome to His Excellency Mr. Barisa Colak, Minister
of Security of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Colak
(Bosnia and Herzegovina) took a seat at the
Council table; Mr. Hoscheit (Luxembourg) took
the seat reserved for him at the side of the
Council Chamber.

The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Lord Paddy
Ashdown, High Representative for the Implementation
of the Peace Agreement on Bosnia and Herzegovina.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Lord Ashdown to take a seat at the
Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2005/156, which contains a letter dated
10 March 2005 from the Secretary-General,
transmitting the twenty-seventh report of the High
Representative for the Implementation of the Peace
Agreement on Bosnia and Herzegovina.

I now give the floor to Lord Paddy Ashdown,
High Representative for the Implementation of the
Peace Agreement on Bosnia and Herzegovina.
