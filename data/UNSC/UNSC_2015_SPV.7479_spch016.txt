The President: There are no more names inscribed
on the list of speakers.

Before adjourning the meeting, I would like, as
this is the last scheduled meeting of the Council for the
month of June 2015, to express the sincere appreciation
of the delegation of Malaysia to the members of the
Council, especially my colleagues, the Permanent
Representatives, their respective staff and to the
secretariat of the Council for all the support they have
given us.

I believe this has been a useful wrap-up session.
Some of the suggestions on working methods and others
will help us not only to address issues in a much more
candid and constructive manner during the informal
consultations but also to invest more time in the best
way forward. There have been many useful reflections
that would improve the work of the Council. I hope
that we can agree on a new set of best practices. If we
continue to embrace old styles and habits in the way we
conduct ourselves, we are run the risk of having to face
yet another groundhog day.

Indeed, it has been a busy month and one in which
we have rallied to a consensus on several important
issues within our purview. We could not have done it
alone or without the hard work, support and positive
contributions of every delegation and the representatives
of the Secretariat as well as the relevant conference
service staff.

As we end our presidency, I know that I speak on
behalf of the Council in wishing the delegation of New
Zealand good luck and a very successful presidency in
the month of July. I wish to ensure New Zealand the full
support of the Malaysian delegation.

The meeting rose at 4.55 pm.
