The President: We have come to the end of our
debate.

I now give the floor to the Special Representative
of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed
Conflict, Mr. Olara Otunnu, to make brief comments.
He will be followed by the Executive Director of the
United Nations Children's Fund, Ms. Bellamy.
