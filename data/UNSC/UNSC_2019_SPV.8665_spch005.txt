Mr. Alahmad (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At the
outset, we welcome the adoption of resolution 2498
(2019), which renews the sanctions on Somalia for one
year. We thank the United Kingdom, the penholder, for
its transparent approach and constructive cooperation
throughout the negotiations. Renewal reflects the
importance of continuing to support Somalia at this
crucial phase in its history. We hope that the coming
period will see progress in terms of monitoring
implementation of the sanctions.

At the same time, we also applaud the efforts of
the Federal Government of Somalia to pave the way
towards general elections in 2020 and 2021. We call on
all Somali parties to join efforts in order to overcome
barriers that hamper social, political and economic
integration and improvements in the security situation
and to prioritize national interests above all else. In
that context, we hope to continue our shared Vision of
assisting the Somali people in building a united federal
State that protects the fundamental freedoms and
human rights of all citizens.

In conclusion, we reiterate our call for respect for
the independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty
of Somalia. We call on the international community
to continue its political and financial support to the
Federal Government of Somalia to enable it to rebuild
the State and restore stability.
