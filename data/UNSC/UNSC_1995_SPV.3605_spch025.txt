Mr. Ladsous (France) (interpretation from French):
I apologize for speakng again, but I cannot help but react
to the assertion made by the Permanent Representative of
Rwanda when he said that:

"Operation Turquoise only exacerbated an already
complex situation. In spite of its mandate to provide
security and to protect displaced persons
Operation Turquoise provided a safe haven for the
perpetrators of genocide" (supra, p. 42).

I should simply like to recall two facts. First,
Operation Turquoise was a humanitarian operation, an
operation intended strictly to save human lives at a
time - and we must remember this - when the
international community had been unable to mobilize to
reinstall the United Nations Assistance Mission for
Rwanda (UNAMIR) at the level required to act
effectively against genocide and to resolve all the
tragedies that were taking place at that time. I would
merely point out in passing that that humanitarian
mandate was carried out by a multinational force in which
many African countries participated.

 

Secondly, and this fact is also unchallengeable,
Operation Turquoise was undertaken on the basis of a
mandate given by the Security Council in resolution 929
(1994) of 22 June 1994. My country was an active
participant in that force. We did not do so, obviously, to be
thanked later; we did so simply because there was a human
tragedy to be resolved and because hundreds of thousands
of people were being threatened with massacre, and I
believe that any satisfaction we may feel is at having
prevented those persons from being massacred in their turn.
