Mr. Kaiser (Czech Republic): I have the honour
to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU). First
of all, I would like to thank Mr. Rashid Khalikov of the
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for
his comprehensive briefing.

Allow me to inform the Council that on
16 March, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the
European Union met in Brussels and adopted
conclusions in which they called upon the Government
of the Sudan to urgently reconsider its decision to
expel 13 international humanitarian non-governmental
organizations (NGOs)and revoke the licences of three
local NGOs. The Ministers also called on the
Government of the Sudan to ensure that humanitarian
assistance to the most vulnerable people in the Sudan
be continuously guaranteed, guided by the principles of
human rights and international humanitarian law.
Moreover, the Ministers recalled the declaration by the
Presidency on behalf of the European Union. In this
declaration, the EU expresses its belief that the
continued delivery of humanitarian assistance to the
Sudan is of the highest importance to saving lives and
is crucial to creating an environment conducive to the
implementation of all peace processes in the Sudan,
which the European Union will continue to support
strongly.

The decision by the Government of the Sudan to
expel 13 international NGOs from the Sudan and to
revoke the licences of three local NGOs is a direct and
immediate threat to the continuity of international
humanitarian assistance in Darfur and damages eight
operations in the rest of the northern Sudan. These
NGOs provide a vital service to millions of vulnerable
Sudanese civilians, guided by the principles of human
rights and international humanitarian law.
