Mr. Heusgen (Germany): First, I would like to
thank my colleagues around the table for accepting a
revision in this way. I very much appreciate that. As I
said in my previous statement, what we are doing here
today is supporting a people that has been under strain
and embroiled in conflict and has been the victim of
terrorist attacks. Last night, we saw two more terrorist
attacks in Kabul.

I think that the adoption of resolution 2489 (2019)
at this juncture sends a very important signal to the
Afghan people. It is a signal that the United Nations and
the Security Council stand by the people ofAfghanistan.
We are sending the Afghan people the message that the
United Nations stands by them. We do notjust roll over
the mandate but we add substantive points.

With regard to the peace process, I think it is very
important that we now have a clear statement that it
is Afghan-led and Afghan-owned. For us, it is very
important to focus now on the elections ahead, which
is what the United Nations Assistance Mission in
Afghanistan is tasked with.

The text also considers the situation of women in
the country, which is very high on the Council's agenda.
The Deputy Secretary-General travelled to Afghanistan
and reported to the Security Council about the situation
of women. It is very important for that to be reflected in
the text of the resolution. It is also critical that the text
also addresses sexual violence and accountability. We
note that the resolution also recognizes and highlights
that both women and children are victims of the conflict
and stresses respect for human rights.

I would like to thank our Chinese friends, who came
to the negotiations with a different position and were
able, after a long discussion, to strike a compromise that
took all views into account. I also thank our Indonesian
colleagues. Our teams worked for hours and did not
sleep last night. I thank the entire Council for sending
this strong message to the Afghan people today.
