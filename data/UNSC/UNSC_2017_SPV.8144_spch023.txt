Mr. Vitrenko (Ukraine): Just a few days ago, I
made a statement in which I quoted not a Ukrainian
official, but the former Secretary-General of the United
Nations. Allow me to briefly repeat it, followed by an
additional quotation.

"I am particularly concerned about the situation
on and around the border between Ukraine and the
Russian Federation. This remains a key obstacle to
the de-escalation of the situation on the ground, as
arms and heavy weaponry reportedly continue to
flow unabated into Ukraine from Russia. There is
an urgent need to ensure a secure border between
the two countries, with international verification,
as discussed in the Minsk talks."

That quotation is from the Secretary-General's
press conference on 29 August 2014, and if that is not
sufficient evidence for the Russian Federation of its
aggression against Ukraine, I wonder what is.

To give another quotation:

"In the case of the Ukraine, security assurances
were an essential condition for its accession to
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. However,
the credibility of the assurances given to Ukraine
in the Budapest Memorandum of 1994 has been
seriously undermined by recent events, such
as the occupation of Crimea and parts of the
Donbas. The implications are profound, both for
regional security and the integrity of the nuclear
non-proliferation regime."

That is a quotation from a statement made by the
Secretary-General at the opening meeting ofthe Nuclear
Security Summit on 24 March 2014 at The Hague.
