Mr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Russia attaches great importance to the draft
resolution that we are about to adopt today. It is likely
to become an important element in international efforts
to settle the conflict in Sierra Leone. This document
puts barriers in the way of the criminal diamond trade
of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), which is
fuelling a continuation of the conflict. The resolution
sends a clear and unambiguous signal to the
participants in this business from other countries on the
unacceptability of the situation that has arisen for the
international community.

We believe it is extremely important that the
measures provided for in the draft resolution in this
area should not be detrimental to the interests of
legitimate participants in the international diamond
market. The resolution also provides for tightening
control over the observation of the embargo on military
supplies to Sierra Leone imposed earlier. We hope that
the tightening of this control will play an important
role in stabilizing the situation in that country.

It is of fundamental importance that the duration
of the sanctions regime, in relation to the illegitimate
export of diamonds from Sierra Leone, is limited to 18
months from the time of adoption of the draft
resolution. After that time, the Council will once again
review the situation in Sierra Leone and, if necessary,
will take decisions as to whether the sanctions should
be extended, whether they should be adjusted or
whether supplementary measures should be taken. In
this way, with the adoption of this resolution, a further
step will be taken towards making the mechanism of
the imposition of sanctions more effective and
equitable, including a further confirmation in practice
of the principle of time limitations on the imposition of
sanctions.

On this basis, Russia will vote for this draft
resolution.
