Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I am not planning to engage in a detailed
discussion with my British colleague. I have already
said everything I wanted to say in my statement.

Ijust want to emphasize one thing, which is that
we have not received a formal request, in line with the
Chemical Weapons Convention, to which we were and
remain ready to respond. We were given a 24-hour
ultimatum. Once again, let me stress that we have no
intention of responding in a tone or form like those of
the unsubstantiated accusations made against us before
we had the opportunity to respond. But we are ready to
cooperate with the British Government in investigating
this sad incident. In my opinion, nothing that I said
earlier contradicts that.

The meeting rose at 4.30 pm.
