The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now make
a statement in my national capacity.

We would like to thank Mrs. Nakamitsu for her
briefing. We are grateful to the representative of the
United Kingdom for the information that she provided
to us.

Peru has noted with deep concern the incident
caused by the use of a nerve agent in public spaces in
the United Kingdom, which has seriously endangered
the lives of at least three people. We would like to
reaffirm our solidarity with the victims, to whom
we wish a full recovery, and with the people in the
United Kingdom who have been potentially exposed
to the chemical agent in question. Peru condemns
all use of chemical weapons. We believe that such a
practice constitutes a threat to international peace and
security, a heinous crime and a flagrant violation of
the related non-proliferation regime. In the light of the
investigations and the report issued by the Organization
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on the blood
samples of the direct victims of the attack, we must
emphasize that the Chemical Weapons Convention
prohibits the use of any substance as a chemical weapon.

Lastly, we urge the parties concerned to fully
cooperate with the investigations with a view to
determining responsibilities and penalties as a result of
the incident, in line with the principle of the peaceful
resolution of disputes.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

The representative of the United Kingdom has
asked to make a further statement.
