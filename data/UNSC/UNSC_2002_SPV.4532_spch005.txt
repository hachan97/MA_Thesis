The President: I noticed earlier that there was
some puzzlement among observers when I called on a
non-member of the Council to speak first. I should
have explained that in our prior consultations we
agreed that, in proceedings this morning, Ambassador
Levitte would first present his report, after which we
would invite non-members of the Council to speak and
then throw open the floor to Council members to
respond or make additional comments.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table
and to make his statement.
