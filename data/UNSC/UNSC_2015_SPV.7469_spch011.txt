Mr. Taula (New Zealand): We thank the Permanent
Representative of Spain, as Chair of the Security
Council Committee established pursuant to resolution
1737 (2006), for his briefing. New Zealand commends
the Chairman's work and that of the Committee and
its Panel of Experts in maintaining oversight of this
complex sanctions regime.

Today's briefing is somewhat overshadowed by an
air of expectation around the P5+l negotiations with
Iran in pursuit of a comprehensive agreement on Iran's
nuclear programme. New Zealand acknowledges the
efforts of the parties to the negotiations. We reiterate
our support for the process and hope that negotiations
will be concluded in keeping with the original intent.

We appreciate that the negotiations are sensitive for
the key parties involved, but trust that these sensitivities
will not stand in the way of a comprehensive outcome.
Be that as it may, today sanctions remain in place. They
place obligations on States Members of the United
Nations and, as such, the work of this Committee
remains extant.

While we welcome the prospect of an agreement,
until such time as one is reached the Committee must
continue to monitor and improve the enforcement of
existing sanctions, just as the Panel of Experts must
continue to investigate violations and clarify obligations
to Member States.

Finally, we encourage all parties involved in
the negotiations to sustain the commitment and the
political will required for a positive, peaceful and
lasting solution.
