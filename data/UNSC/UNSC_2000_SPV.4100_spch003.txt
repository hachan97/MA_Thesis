The President (spoke in Spanish): I warmly thank
the Deputy Secretary-General for her statement, and I
would also like to thank her for her kind words regarding
the Government of Argentina's support for the United
Nations peacekeeping operations.

The next speaker is Ms. Catherine Bertini, Executive
Director of the World Food Programme. I invite her to take
a seat at the Council table and to make her statement.
