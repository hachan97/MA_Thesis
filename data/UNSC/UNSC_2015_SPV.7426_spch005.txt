Mr. Oyarzun Marchesi (Spain) (spoke in Spanish):
Spain would like to express its full support for
resolution 2216 (2015), on the situation in Yemen,
submitted by the delegation of Jordan. We trust that the
message of the Security Council will be clear to all the
parties to the conflict, and help to halt the escalation of
violence. In particular, I would like to underscore the
call to dialogue and the appeal for a political solution
based on consensus. Inclusive dialogue is the only way
to achieve the goals of unity and prosperity for Yemen
that we all desire.

We also have faith in the full involvement of the
Secretary-General and his team, with a view to helping
to resolve this crisis as early as possible and facilitating
the path to a return to a democratic transition led by the
Yemenis themselves.

We share the concern of the other members of the
Council over the longstanding humanitarian crisis that
has affected the Yemeni population, which can only
worsen with further the armed clashes. We therefore
emphasize the importance of complying with the
requirements set out in this and other resolutions on
Yemen.

Lastly, I would like to point out the importance
of transparency in negotiations in order to ensure the
constructive contribution of the 15 members of the
Security Council. Such will allow us to achieve the
highest level of consensus possible in this as well as in
other matters.
