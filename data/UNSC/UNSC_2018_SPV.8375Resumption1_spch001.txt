The President (Spoke in Spanish): In accordance
with rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure, I invite the representative of Costa Rica to
participate in this meeting.

I wish to remind all speakers to limit their
statements to no more than four minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to circulate the texts in writing and to deliver
a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.

I now give the floor to the representative of the
Syrian Arab Republic.
