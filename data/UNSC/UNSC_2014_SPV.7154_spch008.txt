Mr. Araud (France) (spoke in French): Since
yesterday, we have seen the abrupt and simultaneous
outbreak of violence in eastern Ukraine: nothing about
it was spontaneous. France condemns the violence. We
call on all parties to exercise restraint and dialogue so
that a peaceful solution to the crisis quickly emerges.
Everyone must work towards de-escalation.

The scenario we are seeing reminds one of the
events that took place in Crimea one month ago:
simultaneous action by a small but trained group of
aggressive activists determined to occupy territory,
followed by the presence of disciplined, masked men
wearing uniforms and armed with weapons of war
that are not found in military surplus. Those facts,
which come to us through the waves of images on the
Internet, are the same as the ones that Russia labelled
a month ago as spontaneous demonstrations by local
self-defence groups. No one believed it then, and we
do not believe it today. One gets the impression that, in
denying the facts, Russia is unaware ofthe existence of
the Internet and that it serves to contradict its denials.
Let us not forget that such protests were a prelude to the
annexation of Crimea.

Moreover, the build-up of Russian troops for
several weeks now - under the guise of military
exercises - casts an ominous shadow over eastern
Ukraine. Further still, the economic pressure is
becoming more biting. Without dialogue with the
Ukrainian side, which it has taken by the throat, Russia
has brutally raised the price of gas. It blocks the entry
of goods at the border between Russia and Ukraine,
no doubt in an effort to stifle a country it calls its
brother. Finally, Russia is systematically bombarding
Ukraine with a message of defiance vis-a-vis Kyiv via
the airwaves and television channels, which, for many
people who do not have access to various sources of
information, is the only message they hear.

It is against that backdrop that France commends
the level-headedness of Ukrainian officials who,
against that destabilizing torrent of events, seek to
resolve the crisis through dialogue. That is the spirit
in which Prime Minister Yatsenyuk visited eastern
Ukraine with specific proposals in response to the real
questions of people overwhelmed by propaganda who
are disoriented and being exploited by radical groups.
France has always been clear on the issue of the status
oflanguages and regions. We encourage the authorities
in Kyiv to continue their efforts for cooler heads to
prevail, enter into a constructive dialogue and reassure
people about their place in Ukraine.

The future of Ukraine should not, and cannot, be
up to anyone else but the Ukrainians themselves. We
should support the Ukrainian authorities in organizing
elections, under the best of conditions, that ensure that
everyone is represented. Our message has always been
clear that the presidential election scheduled for 25 May
must be free and transparent and guaranteed by the
presence of international observers.

We reiterate our commitment to the territorial
integrity of Ukraine. We call on Russia commit to
de-escalation and to condemn, along with the rest of
the Council, the attempts at destabilization carried out
by armed groups in eastern Ukraine. We also call on
Russia to fully assume its role as a permanent member
of the Security Council. Russia is a guarantor of peace
and security in the world, both in the larger world
and in its immediate neighbourhood. There cannot be
two different standards. Russia must today put its full
weight behind helping Ukraine regain stability. It must
show itself up to the task ofplaying the role it wishes to

play as a pillar of Euro-Asian stability. We hope that the
proposed meeting on 17 April among Russia, Ukraine,
the United States and the European Union will be held
and that it makes it possible for solutions to emerge.
This is a crucial stage and we call on all parties to
exercise calm and restraint.

In conclusion, I would like to raise a final warning
call. The danger that now faces us is the failure of all
our concerted efforts to build an international order
that is not based on force, for today it is force alone that
is seeking to impose the law.
