Ms. Rodriguez de Ortiz (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): Thank you,
Mr. President, for having granted me the floor - I do
apologize. However, I feel obliged to speak again,
despite the length of the meeting.

My delegation simply cannot understand why the
United States is failing to comply with an extradition
treaty. This is all the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
is asking for: that the United States should honour the
commitments it has undertaken in the agreement
between our two countries. We have fulfilled all the
requirements to enable the terrorist, Luis Posada
Carriles, to be arrested and extradited to our country,
where we will try him for his terrorist acts.

The Government of the United States has at its
disposal all the necessary documentary evidence of the
terrorist nature of the acts of Luis Posada Carriles and
yet, despite this, has chosen to protect him. All he has
been charged with by the United States Government is
minor immigration offences which allow him his
freedom in this country.

We are faced with a case where a terrorist is
being protected. The attitude of the Government of the
United States in this case is a travesty of justice and an
insult to the memory of the victims of the terrorist acts,
and it adds to the pain and suffering of the families of
those victims.

Moreover, there is today a new element. It would
be absurd to suppose that Venezuela would practise
torture when we faithfully observe the maxim "pacta
sunt servanda" and fulfil our obligations. We are a
party to the Convention against Torture, and we respect
its provisions. The Security Council must review this
case and the Counter-Terrorism Committee must assess
it, with a view to prevailing on the Government of the
United States to comply with its commitment to fight
terrorism and to fulfil its obligations under
international law.
