Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria) (spoke in French):
Allow me first of all, Sir, to express the Algerian
delegation's pleasure at seeing you preside over the
Security Council for the month of April. Let me also
express our satisfaction, which I am certain is shared
by all Member States, at the praiseworthy manner in
which you have always conducted the presidency in all
respects.

I also wish to thank you for the promptness with
which you responded to the requests of the Arab Group
and of the Non-Aligned Movement to convene an
emergency meeting on the critical situation in
Palestine. I wish further to thank Ambassador Kolby of
Norway for the outstanding skill with which he
presided over the Council's work during the month of
March, which was a particularly busy month.

Last week's failed assassination attempt on
President Yasser Arafat revealed the true intentions of
the political heirs of the assassins of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin: they are attempting to kill the peace
process and its outcome, the creation of a Palestinian
State.

Algeria vehemently condemns the Israeli military
escalation against the Palestinian people and the
Palestinian Authority. It hails the heroic resistance of
the Palestinian people and of its legitimate leadership,
headed by President Arafat, whose steadfastness and
endurance in the face of the criminal conduct of the
Israeli occupation forces deserve the support and
admiration of all.

International public opinion can no longer remain
indifferent to the tragedy of the Palestinian people,
who have been left defenceless before the bloodthirsty
onslaught of an adversary of superior military power
acting with total impunity and in manifest contempt for
international law.

The Security Council, in particular, is called upon
today to take a stance on its own decisions and on the
lawless actions of Israel. How much longer must we
wait before the Council decides to renounce the
practice of double standards, which prevents it from
taking the urgent and immediate action that is its duty
on issues of international peace and security? The very
credibility of the Council is at stake, as is the moral
authority of the co-sponsors of the peace process.

On several occasions in recent months, Algeria,
speaking here in the Council, has described the
situation in Palestine as one of war, demanding the
implementation of the relevant provisions of
international humanitarian law, in particular the Fourth
Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of
Civilians in Time of War. Given that the head of the
Israeli Government recently declared publicly that his
country was at war, it is necessary for urgent measures
to be taken to end the ongoing genocide of the
Palestinian people and to set out, on a legal basis -
which has now been clearly established - the facts
surrounding the war crimes carried out by the Israeli
occupation forces.

As for the future of Palestine and of the region, it
is now clear that Ariel Sharon wishes to erect a barrier
of blood and hatred between Israeli and Palestinian
society. Furthermore, through his unsavoury
manoeuvres, carried out with international support, he
is also trying to put up a barrier of misunderstanding
between the Arab peoples and the people of the United
States of America. The Council must question the aims
and objectives of that plan.

Algeria calls upon the international community to
acknowledge the exceptional seriousness of the
situation in Palestine and to reject the linkage that the
Israelis are trying to establish between the liberation
struggle of the Palestinian people and international
terrorism. The fundamental difference between those
two situations lies in the fact that young Palestinians
who have chosen to confront Israeli State terrorism by
giving up their lives for their country have died on
their own occupied soil.

In conclusion, the international community has,
on many occasions, proclaimed that weapons of mass
destruction should not fall into irresponsible hands.
Today, Algeria would like to express its profound,
legitimate and well-founded concern regarding the
possession of a formidable nuclear arsenal by Israel,
which surely does not deserve to be described as a
responsible State. In the light of the events that the
world has witnessed in recent days, the risk of that
arsenal being used against the Arab nation is no longer
merely a matter of academic speculation.
