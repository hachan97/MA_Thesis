Mr. Laro (Nigeria): Itoo thank Assistant Secretary-
General ad interim Toyberg-Frandzen for his briefing.

Nigeria remains convinced that a negotiated
settlement represents the most viable path to lasting
peace between Israel and Palestine. That is why we are
concerned by the lack of progress in the peace process.
There is a need for both parties to show flexibility and
the political will to negotiate in good faith. Nigeria
believes that the relevant Security Council resolutions,
the Madrid principles of land for peace, the road map for
peace in the Middle East and the Arab Peace Initiative
all form a valid basis for the attainment of lasting peace
between Israel and Palestine.

What is required now, in our view, is for the
leadership on both sides to take the courageous
decisions that would allow the peace process to move
forward. Peace cannot be imposed from the outside. It
has to come from within. We urge both sides to avoid
the unilateral action and hostile rhetoric that deepen
mistrust between them and push back the prospects for
resumption of peace talks. There is no alternative to a
negotiated solution. We wish to make it abundantly clear
that Nigeria would like to see the Israeli-Palestinian
issue resolved within the framework of a two-State
solution that would allow both Israel and Palestine to
live side by side in peace and security.
