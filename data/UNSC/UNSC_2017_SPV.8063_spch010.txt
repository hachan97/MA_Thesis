Mr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): Ukraine reiterates its
full support of Colombia's efforts in the implementation
of the final peace agreement, in accordance with the
relevant Security Council resolutions. We welcome
the completion of the mandate of the United Nations
Mission in Colombia on 25 September, as was stated
in the presidential statement S/PRST/20l7/18, just
adopted. We welcome the official beginning of the
United Nations Verification Mission in Colombia, the
second United Nations special political mission to
support the Colombian peace process.

We are also proud to note that, through its Mission
in Colombia, the United Nations has contributed to the
successful implementation of the crucial agreements on
the ceasefire and the laying down of arms. I wish we
had more people like that at the United Nations. That is
why we believe that the United Nations should carefully
study the lessons learned in Colombia and apply such
best practices in other parts of the world.

We welcome the temporary national bilateral
ceasefire announced between the Government of
Colombia and the Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional, and
welcome resolution 2381 (2017), which supports that
positive development. I would also like to express our
appreciation to the British delegation for its leadership
and hard work in preparing the draft resolution and
presidential statement, which led to their successful
adoption.

Finally, the Security Council should continue to
provide the support required to advance peace, human
rights and development for all citizens in Colombia.
