Mr. Ri Tong 11 (Democratic People's Republic of Korea): I will finish injust a few sentences.

As long as the United States maintains more than
1,000 nuclear weapons and continues to increase its
nuclear threats and blackmail against the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea's already diversified nuclear strike
means will be targeted at the United States.

On 28 April, a spokesperson of the National
Defence Commission of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea again made a statement in the face
of the rumours wildly spread by the United States
Government that it would not recognize or accept the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea as a nuclear-
weapon State, and that therefore the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea should abandon nuclear
weapons. Again, the spokesperson made it very clear
that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea did not
make nuclear weapons to be recognized by the United
States nor, did it make nuclear weapons to be approved
by the United States.

I will finish soon.
