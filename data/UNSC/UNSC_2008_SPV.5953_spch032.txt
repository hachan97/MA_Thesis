Mr. Alasania (Georgia): I would like to make a
brief comment. As I heard Ambassador Churkin
talking, the question asked and the answer that was
received, for me, confirm that what the Russian
Federation is seeking through this military aggression
and invasion is to change the democratically elected
Georgian Government. But I really want to seek more
clarification, as was just requested by our colleague
from the United States, from the representative of the
Russian Federation.
