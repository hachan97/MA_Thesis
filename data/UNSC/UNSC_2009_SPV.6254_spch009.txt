Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): As
Chair of the Somalia sanctions Committee established
pursuant to resolution 751 (1992), Mexico is convinced
that the sanctions regime should contribute to the
creation of better security conditions in Somalia and to
the strengthening of the Djibouti peace process.

The resolution we adopted today expands the
mandate both of the sanctions Committee and of its
Monitoring Group to a practically regional focus,
which involves an unprecedented challenge both for
the Security Council and for the countries of the
region. Mexico will continue to guide the work of the
Committee in a transparent manner with a focus on
taking clear, consistent decisions in order to use
sanctions as a means of providing control and
incentives to get the various regional actors to join a
process directed towards the stability of the region.
