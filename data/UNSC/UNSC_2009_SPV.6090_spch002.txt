Mr. Takasu (Japan): This is the ninth 90-day
report to the Security Council in accordance with
paragraph 18 (h) of resolution 1737 (2006) and the first
in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee. The
report covers the period from 11 December 2008 to
10 March 2009, during which time the Committee held
no meetings but conducted its work using the silence
procedure.

Under the chairmanship of my predecessor,
Ambassador Jan Grauls of Belgium, the Committee
responded to a written query received from a Member
State seeking clarifications on aspects of the sanctions
regime relevant to interactions with an entity
designated in the annex to resolution 1737 (2006). The
Committee also approved its annual report for 2008,
contained in document S/2008/839.

In the new year, after I had taken over, the
Committee received from the secretariat of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) a copy of
a report by the IAEA Director General, entitled
"Technical Cooperation: The Agency's Proposed
Programme for 2009-2011", as well as an addendum to
that report, entitled "Evaluation of Technical
Cooperation to be provided to Iran during the
Technical Cooperation Cycle 2009-2011". The Board
of Governors of the IAEA had approved the report and
concurred with the evaluation of technical cooperation
to be provided to Iran in the light of resolutions 1737
(2006), 1747 (2007) and 1803 (2008).

As has been the case in the past, the Committee
received two notifications - one at the end of last year
and the other at the beginning of this year - from the
Russian Federation with reference to paragraph 5 of
resolution 1737 (2006), concerning the delivery of
items for use in the nuclear power plant at Bushehr,
Iran.

On 3 February 2009, the Committee received a
letter from a Member State seeking guidance with
respect to its inspections of cargo on a vessel carrying
its flag that had been found to be carrying arms-related
materiel. The Committee responded to that letter on
6 February, stating that the transfer of the materiel in
question constituted a violation of paragraph 5 of
resolution 1747 (2007), which states that

"Iran shall not supply, sell or transfer directly or
indirectly from its territory or by its nationals or
using its flag vessels or aircraft any arms or
related materiel, and that all States shall prohibit
the procurement of such items from Iran by their
nationals, or using their flag vessels or aircraft".

The Member State provided additional
information to the Committee on 12 February, and the
Committee subsequently responded on 24 February. On
9 March 2009 - yesterday - the Committee sent
letters to the concerned Member States, inviting them
to provide within 10 working days any additional
relevant information regarding that transaction that
may help the Committee carry out its mandate to
examine and take appropriate action on information
regarding alleged violations of the measures imposed
in resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007) and 1803
(2008).

Finally, with regard to reporting by States on their
implementation of all the relevant measures set out in
resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007) and 1803 (2008),
the updated figures are as follows: 91 reports under
resolution 1737 (2006), 78 reports under resolution
1747 (2007) and 65 reports under resolution 1803
(2008).
