Mr. Jagne (Gambia): Allow me to express my
delegation's gratitude to the troika for putting together in
such a timely manner the draft resolution on Angola
which is before us.

The conflict in Angola has been painfully long and
devastating. The perpetuation of the conflict is not in the
interests of the Angolan people. Thus, there is an urgent
need, once again, to give the people of Angola a new
lease on life. They need it badly. The legal framework is
already in place, and strict adherence to the provisions of
the Lusaka Protocol would have brought about a desirable
end to the conflict. Unfortunately, however, delaying
tactics by UNITA constitute the major stumbling block to
the smooth and rapid implementation of that Protocol.

We pay tribute to the Government of Unity and
National Reconciliation of Angola for showing restraint

 

all along by not succumbing to domestic pressures to resort
to the use of force to break the logjam.

The international community has been urging UNITA
to comply with the provisions of the Lusaka peace accord,
but to no avail. My delegation has been echoing the need
to send unambiguous signals to UNITA indicating the
international community's non-acceptance of any moves
that would stagnate or reverse the peace process. We are
glad that with the adoption of the present draft resolution
the Security Council will do just that.

It will be recalled that during his most recent briefing
to the Council some days ago Maitre Alioune Blondin
Beye, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General,
put forward some practical proposals to end the stalemate
and to bring the Angolan crisis to an end once and for all.
We hope that with this draft resolution UNITA will get the
message that enough is enough, and we expect them to
receive it in good faith and to comply accordingly in the
supreme interest of the beleaguered people of Angola.

In this regard, my delegation fully supports the draft
resolution before us and will vote in favour of it.
