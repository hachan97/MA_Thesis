Mr. Pleuger (Germany): Germany supports the
position of the European Union as expressed in the
statement made by the Greek presidency earlier this
morning. We agree, in particular, with the remarks
pertaining to article 16 of the Rome Statute. We also
share the views of the Secretary-General and the
concerns expressed by all the delegations in the open
debate. We therefore could not vote in favour of the
draft resolution.

Germany was and remains a major driving force
in the creation of the International Criminal Court
(ICC). As a State party, Germany is deeply committed
to the mission of the ICC: to fight impunity by
prosecuting those responsible for the most serious
crimes that are of concern to the international
community in situations where national jurisdictions do
not prosecute those crimes. The International Criminal
Court project has been consistently and actively
supported by the present and earlier Governments of
the Federal Republic of Germany. The German
Parliament has repeatedly expressed its support for the
ICC across party lines.

We feel that a treaty already ratified by 90 States
and signed or ratified by 12 of the 15 Security Council
members should not be amended by a Security Council
resolution.

Justice is, and must remain, indivisible. At the
beginning of the new millennium, the International
Criminal Court will serve as an efficient and
indispensable instrument to further international
security, peace and justice.

We do not share the view that the ICC is an
impediment to peacekeeping. On the contrary, the ICC
is a safeguard. As an institution designed to prevent
impunity, the ICC can play an important role in
protecting peacekeepers in the execution of their
missions.

Meanwhile, the Judges and the Prosecutor of the
ICC have been elected. Germany is confident that
experience will show that the Court is going to work
impartially, justly and without politically motivated
misuse.
