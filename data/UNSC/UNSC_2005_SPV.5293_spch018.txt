The President: In order to optimize the use of
our time, I will not invite speakers individually to take
their seats at the table and invite them to resume their
seats at the side. When a speaker takes the floor, the
Conference Officer will seat the next speaker on the
list at the table.

I also wish to repeat my earlier call for oral
interventions to be kept within the five-minute limit.

I thank you in advance for your understanding
and cooperation.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Samoa, to whom I give the floor.
