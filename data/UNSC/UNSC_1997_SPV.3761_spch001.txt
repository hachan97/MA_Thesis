The President: As this is the first meeting of the
Security Council for the month of April, I should like to
take this opportunity to pay tribute, on behalf of the
Council, to His Excellency Mr. Zbigniew Maria Wlosowicz,
Permanent Representative of Poland to the United Nations,
for his service as President of the Security Council for the
month of March 1997. I am sure I speak for all members
of the Security Council in expressing deep appreciation to
Ambassador Wlosowicz for the great diplomatic skill with
which he conducted the Council's business last month.

Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.

Letters dated 20 and 23 December 1991, from France,
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland and the United States of America (S/23306, S/23307, S/23308, S/23309 and S/23317)

The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.

Following consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"On 29 March 1997, a Libyan-registered
aircraft flew from Tripoli, Libya, to Jeddah, Saudi
Arabia. The Security Council considers this clear
violation of Council resolution 748 (1992) of 31
March 1992 as totally unacceptable and calls on
Libya to refrain from any further such violations. It
recalls that arrangements have been made consistent
with resolution 748 (1992) in order to fly Libyan
pilgrims to perform the Hajj. The Council will
review the matter should further violations occur.

"The Council has requested the Committee
established pursuant to resolution 748 (1992) to
draw to the attention of Member States their
obligations under resolution 748 (1992) in the event
that Libyan-registered aircraft land in their territory."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/l997/18.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda. The
Security Council will remain seized of the matter.

The meeting rose at 1.15 pm.
