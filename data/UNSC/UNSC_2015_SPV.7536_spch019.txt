Mrs. ngu (Nigeria): I want to thank you,
Mr. President, for convening this emergency meeting.
I also want to thank Assistant Secretary-General
Zerihoun for his very sombre briefing.

All peoples and nations of goodwill acknowledge
that the current surge in violence and killings in
Jerusalem has become a potent threat to international
peace and security. What began as clashes around the
holy sites has spilled into residential neighbourhoods
and the West Bank, with a rising death toll. That
carnage is complicating an already difficult situation.
We condemn the killings in unequivocal terms, and
call for calm on both sides. The parties must exercise
restraint, refrain from provocative actions and rhetoric,
and preserve the status quo at the holy sites.

The indication at this time is that the root causes
of the violence must be addressed urgently and
comprehensively within the framework of a negotiated
political solution. Genuine efforts must be made to
restart the peace process. Both sides must work to
create the conditions that would facilitate that process.
In that context, we want to urge the Israeli authorities to
put an immediate cessation to settlement construction
in the occupied Palestinian territory. That is not only
illegal under international law, it constitutes a major
impediment to the search for a lasting peace. We call
on regional leaders and other States with influence over
the parties to encourage them to resume negotiations on
the basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions,
the Quartet road map, the Madrid principles, the Arab
Peace Initiative and relative agreements between them.

In this conflict the two-State solution is inescapable
and, indeed, inevitable. We take this opportunity to
reaffirm our support for a two-State solution, with
Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and
security.
