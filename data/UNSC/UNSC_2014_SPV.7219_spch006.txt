Ms. Power (United States of America): Yesterday
we were all shocked by the downing of Malaysia Airlines
Flight 17. All 298 people aboard - 283 passangers and
15 crew members - were killed. As we stared at the
passanger list yesterday, we saw next to three of the
passangers' names a capital "I". As we now know, that
letter stands for "infant". To the families and friends
of the victims, it is impossible to find words to express
our condolences. We can only commit to them that we
will not rest until we find out what happened. A full,
credible and unimpeded international investigation
must begin immediately. The perpetrators must be
brought to justice; they must not be sheltered by any
State Member of the United Nations.

Let me share with the Council our assesment of the
evidence so far.

We assess that Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, carrying
298 people from Amsterdan to Kuala Lumpur, was
likely downed by a surface-to-air missile (SAM) - an
SA-11 - operated from a separatist-held location in
eastern Ukraine. The airliner was travelling at a cruise
altitude of 33,000 feet, and its speed was typical for an
airliner along an established flight corridor frequented
by commercial traffic. The flight was transmiting
its assigned transponder code, corresponding with
its flight plan, and flight tracking data was publicly
available on the Internet. There was nothing threatening
or provocative about MH-17.

Of the operational SAM. systems located near the
border, only the SA-Il, SA-20 and SA-22 systems are
capable of hitting an aircraft at the flight's altitude
of 33,000 feet. We can rule out shorter-range SAMSs
known to be in separatist hands, including man-
portable air defence systems, and SA-8 and SA-13
systems, which are not capable of hitting an aircraft at
that altitude. Early Thursday, an SA-ll SAM. system
was reported near Zahnitkiv by a western reporter, and
separatists were spotted hours before the incident with
an SA-Il system at a location close to the site where the
plane went down.

Separatists initially claimed responsibility for
shooting down a military transport plane, and posted
videos that are now being connected to the Malaysia
Airlines crash. Separatist leaders also boasted on social
media about shooting down a plane, but later deleted
those messages. Because of the technical complexity
of the SA-11, it is unlikely that the separatists could
effectively operate the system without assistance from
knowledgeable personnel. Therefore, we cannot rule
out technical assistance from Russian personnel in
operating the systems. The Ukrainians do have SA-ll
systems in their inventory; however, we are not aware
of any Ukrainian SAM. systems in the area of the shoot-
down. More important, since the beginning of the crisis
Ukrainian air defences have not fired a single missile,
despite several alleged violations of their airspace by
Russian aircraft.

This also follows a pattern of actions by Russian-
backed separatists. On 13 June, separatists shot down
a Ukrainian transport plane carrying 40 paratroopers
and 9 crew members. On 24 June, as the Council was
meeting to welcome Ukraine's unilateral ceasefire
(see S/PV.7205), we received word that separatists
had downed a Ukrainian helicopter, killing all nine
aboard. On 14 July, separatists claimed credit for
downing a Ukrainian military cargo plane flying at
6,000 metres. And on 16 July they claimed credit
for the downing of a Ukrainian fighter jet. If indeed
Russian-backed separatists were behind this attack on
a civilian airliner, they and their backers would have
good reason to cover up evidence of their crime. It is
therefore extremely important that an investigation be
commenced immediately.

In the first instance, the special monitoring
mission the of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe should act as a first responder,
thereby laying the foundation for efforts by other
international organizations and individual nations,
including those whose citizens were victims of the
tragedy. Yesterday, President Obama assured Ukraine's
President Poroshenko that United States experts would
offer all possible assistance upon his request. President
Poroshenko has invited the independent and credible
International Civil Aviation Organization to join an
investigation. International investigators must be
granted immediate, full and unfettered access to the
crash site. All those concerned - Russia, pro-Russian
separatists and Ukraine - should agree to support an
immediate ceasefire to facilitate access by international
investigators. In that regard, we look to the monitoring
misson also to reach agreement with separatists and
others in the region to make that possible. All evidence
must remain undisturbed and any evidence removed
from the site by the Russian-backed separatists
operating in the area should be promptly returned and
handed over. Russia needs to help make that happen.

While it make take us some time to firmly establish
who shot down a plane filled with innocents, most
Council members and most members of the international
community have been warning for months about the
devastation that would come if Russia did not stop what
it started - if it did not reign in what it unleashed.
The context for yesterday's horror is clear: separatist
forces backed by the Russian Government continue
to destabilize Ukraine and undermine the efforts of
Ukraine's elected leaders to build a democratic Ukraine
that is stable, unified, secure and able to determine its
own future.

Russia says that it seeks peace in Ukraine, but we
have repeatedly provided the Council with evidence
of Russia's continued support to the separatists. Time
after time, we have called on the Russian Government
to de-escalate the situation by stopping the flow of
fighters and weapons into Ukraine, pressing separatists
to agree to a ceasefire and release all hostages, and
support a road map for negotiations. Time after time,
President Putin has committed to working towards
dialogue and peace - in Geneva in April, in Normandy
in June and in Berlin earlier this month - and every
single time he has broken that commitment.

Here is what we know. In the past few weeks, Russia
has increased the number of tanks, armoured vehicles
and rocket launchers in south-west Russia. More
advanced air defence systems have also arrived. Moscow
recently transferred Soviet- era tanks and artillery to
the separatists, and several military vehicles crossed
the border. After recapturing several Ukrainian cities
last weekend, Ukrainian officials discovered caches
of weapons long associated with Russian stockpiles,
including MANPADs, mines, grenades, meals ready
to eat, vehicles and a pontoon bridge. Ukrainian forces
have discovered large amounts of other Russian-
provided military equipment, including accompanying
documentation verifying Russian origin, in the areas
they have liberated from separatists in recent days.
Recruiting efforts for separatist fighters are expanding
inside Russia, and separatists have openly said that
they were looking for volunteers with experience in
operating heavy weapons such as tanks and air defences.
Russia has allowed officials from the Donetsk People's
Republic to establish a recruiting office in Moscow.
Ukrainian pilot Nadia Savchenko, who has long had
a distinguished career in the Ukrainian military, was
taken by separatists in mid-June. She is now being
held - where? - in a prison in Voronezh, Russia.
According to the Ukrainian Government, she was
transferred to Russia by separatists. Russia continues to
redeploy new forces extremely close to the Ukrainian
border. In addition, on Monday, a Ukrainian air force
cargo plane was shot down in Ukrainian air space, and
on Wednesday a Ukrainian fighter jet was also shot
down in Ukrainian air space. In both instances, the
Ukrainian Government believes that the planes were
fired on from Russian territory.

It is because of such continued destabilizing Russian
actions that the United States imposed sanctions on the
defence, energy and financial sectors of the Russian
economy, including financial institutions. The measures
include freezing the assets ofRussian defence companies
and blocking new financing of some of Russia's most
important banks and energy companies. The sanctions
are significant, but they are also targeted and designed
to have the maximum impact on the Russian calculus
while limiting the impact on the Russian people and
any spillover effects on our interests or those of our
allies. This week, the European Union also announced
expanded sanctions on Russia.

The message is unified and clear: if President Putin
continues to choose escalation over de-escalation, the
international community will continue to impose costs
on Russia. But that is not what any of us want. We and
our allies remain committed to a diplomatic solution,
as are the Ukrainian Government and the Ukrainian
people, who have seen their neighbours, friends and
family members killed in a needless conflict.

President Poroshenko has consistently backed up his
words with actions. He proposed a comprehensive peace
plan and declared a unilateral ceasefire, both of which
were cynically rejected by the illegal armed groups
and their backers in Moscow. President Poroshenko's
plan offered amnesty to separatists who voluntarily
laid down their arms and who are not guilty of capital
crimes. He committed to providing a safe corridor for
Russian fighters to return to Russia. He established a
job-creation programme for the affected areas, made
an offer of broad decentralization and dialogue with
eastern regions, including the promise of early local
elections, and granted increased local control over
language, holidays and customs. President Poroshenko
has also reached out to the regions of eastern Ukraine
and is pursuing constitutional reforms that will give
local regions more authority to choose their regional
leaders and protect locally spoken languages. He has
said that he will meet with separatists in any safe
location, inside or outside Ukraine.

The goal of the United States throughout the crisis
in Ukraine has been consistent, namely, to support a
stable, peaceful and democratic Ukraine. We will not
be satisfied with a temporary halt to violence. Russia
must stop destabilizing Ukraine and allow all the people
of Ukraine to decide their country's future through a
democratic political process. As we sit here, the remains
of nearly 300 people - innocent infants, children,
women and men - are strewn across a blackened,
smouldering landscape in Ukraine. The victims came
from at least nine different nations; they could just as
easily have come from any of ours. We must treat all of
them as our own victims. We have a duty to each and
every one of those individuals, their families and their
countries to determine why that jet fell out of the sky
and to hold the perpetrators accountable. We must stop
at nothing to bring those responsible to justice.

This appalling attack occurred in the context of
a crisis that has been fuelled by Russian support for
separatists through arms, weapons and training, by the
Russian failure to follow through on its commitments
and by its failure to adhere to the fundamental
principles of the United Nations Charter. The tragedy
only underscores the urgency and the determination
with which we insist that Russia immediately take
concrete steps to de-escalate the situation in Ukraine,
support a sustainable ceasefire and follow the path
towards peace that the Ukrainian Government has
consistently offered. This war can be ended. Russia can
end this war. Russia must end this war.
