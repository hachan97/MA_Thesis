The President (spoke in Russian): Before giving
the floor to the next speaker, I should like to inform the
Council that perhaps there was a mistake in
interpretation earlier. The President asked speakers to
limit their statements to five minutes, not 15 or 25.

I now give the floor to the representative of the
Sudan.
