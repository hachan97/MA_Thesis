Mr. Ivanou (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The
delegation of the Republic of Belarus associates itself
with the statement made by the representative of
Malaysia on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement
(NAM), and concurs with the points made.

Belarus generally welcomes the initiative of the
sponsors of the Security Council draft resolution before
us, with the major objective of eliminating the threat
that weapons of mass destruction (WMD) might end up
in the hands of terrorists and their accomplices. Our
country, which has voluntarily renounced possession of
nuclear weapons and is an active participant in the
disarmament process, is interested in stopping all
attempts at the proliferation of WMD throughout the
world. We reaffirm our readiness to expand
cooperation with other States, within the frameworks
of existing international documents and arrangements.

We hope that the efforts of the Security Council
in the area of non-proliferation of WMD will not lead
to a weakening of existing international disarmament
and non-proliferation regimes, but will rather promote
their strengthening and further development.

Belarus wishes to express the certainty that only
collective action on the part of all Member States and
the existence of political will can promote a solution to
the severe problems connected to WMD. We consider
that any new initiative aimed at resolving these
problems will be met with understanding and a positive
response on the part of all concerned members of the
international community.
