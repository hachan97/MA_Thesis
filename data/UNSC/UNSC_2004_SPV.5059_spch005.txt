The President: I thank Mr. Ruperez for his very
welcome first briefing to the Council.
In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers
to limit their statements to no more than five minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. In addition to the members of the
Council, 23 countries have asked to speak. Therefore,
delegations with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to circulate the texts in writing and to deliver
a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.

I shall now give the floor to the members of the
Council.
