The President: In accordance with the understanding
reached in the Council's prior consultations, the Council
will now hear statements by those Member States that wish
to make comments on the report of the Panel of Experts
and to whom invitations have been extended under rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

The first speaker is the representative of Burkina Faso.
I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make
his statement.
