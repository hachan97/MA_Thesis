Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (interpretation from Chinese):
On behalf of the Chinese delegation I would like to thank
those delegations which spoke at this afternoon's
meeting - including Algeria, Brazil, the Netherlands on
behalf of the European Union and its 12 associated
countries, and Mali - for their condolences on the
passing of Mr. Deng Xiaoping. The Chinese delegation
will convey their messages to the Chinese Government
and people, as well as to the family of Mr. Deng. We will
certainly convey these condolences and their sincere
wishes.
