Ms. O'Brien: I would like very briefly to
acknowledge the great interest demonstrated by
Member States in the debate and the close attention
with which the Secretary-General's report (S/2011/360)
has been analysed.

I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate
once again the Secretary-General's deep commitment
to this issue and his concern about continuing concerns
that we have relating to piracy. My Office and other
relevant United Nations offices will continue to
contribute proactively to finding solutions to the
complex problems of piracy off the coast of Somalia,
and I of course stand ready to assist the Security
Council in any way I can as it takes forward its
deliberations on the basis of the Secretary-General's
report.
