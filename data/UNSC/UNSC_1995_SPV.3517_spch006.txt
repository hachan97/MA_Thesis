Mr. Li Zhaoxing (China) (interpretation from Chinese): The Chinese delegation has always closely
followed the development of the situation in Liberia. We
have expressed our deep concern at the stagnation in the
peace process, the breakdown of the cease-fire, the large
quantity of weapons flowing to the country and the
frustration of humanitarian relief activities there.

The key to progress in the Liberian peace process
lies in the good-faith implementation of the Akosombo
and Accra Agreements by all parties to the conflict. They
must immediately implement an effective cease-fire and
establish a Council of State as soon as possible so as to
lay a solid foundation for achieving national
reconciliation.

We endorse and support the convening of a regional
summit meeting aimed at finding an appropriate
settlement to the question of Liberia. In this regard, we
wish to express our gratitude to the Government of
Nigeria and to President Rawlings of Ghana for their
efforts.

The draft resolution before us reflects the spirit of
the Liberian people and conforms to their fundamental
interests. It is also a reflection of the ardent hopes of the
international community. The Chinese delegation will
therefore vote in favour.
