The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council will remain seized of the matter.

As this may be the last public meeting of the
Security Council for December 2009, allow me to
express my gratitude to the five outgoing Council
members: Costa Rica, Croatia, the Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya, Viet Nam and Burkina Faso. I commend
them for their hard work, diligence and drive during
their 2008-2009 term on the Security Council.

The meeting rose at 11.25 am.
