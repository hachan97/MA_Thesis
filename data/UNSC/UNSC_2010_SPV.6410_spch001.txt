The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Alain Le Roy, Under-Secretary-
General for Peacekeeping Operations.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Le Roy to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

I wish to draw the attention of members to the
report of the Secretary-General on the African Union-
United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, contained
in document S/20lO/543. At this meeting, the Security
Council will hear a briefing by Mr. Le Roy, to whom I
now give the floor.
