Mr. Merime'e (France) (interpretation from French): Our Council has just unanimously adopted
resolution 985 extending the mandate of the United
Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) to
30 June 1995. Through approving the resolution, France
wishes to express its desire to see the implementation of
the peace process in Liberia which should have been
assured with the signing of the Akosombo, Cotonou and
Accra Agreements by all the Liberian parties. By
extending UNOMIL's presence in Liberia for a limited
period, France also intends to send a clear message to the
parties.

At the urging of the international community and
with the assistance of the countries of ECOWAS, whose
Chairman has been tireless in this regard, the Liberian
factions have long been called upon to work towards

 
national reconciliation, which alone can guarantee lasting
peace in the country. However, recent events have shown
that the factions have not been resolutely committed to that
course of action: the cease-fire is being more honoured in
the breach than in the observance, human rights violations
seem common and no real progress has been accomplished
in installing the institutions provided for by the Agreements
I mentioned.

In this context, the meeting organized on the initiative
of the Chairman of ECOWAS, which is due to take place
next month in Abuja, seems in many respects to represent
a last chance. My delegation fervently hopes that the
Liberians will put the national interest first and finally
commit themselves, with good faith and a sense of
continuity, to the peace process.

Thus, the Council's decision to extend UNOMIL's
mandate today both sends an invitation and sounds a
warning: it tells the parties that it is not too late to show
genuine resolve to restore lasting peace to Liberia, but it
also makes clear that it will soon be impossible for the
international community to continue to assist Liberia if
Liberians themselves refuse to come to an understanding.
