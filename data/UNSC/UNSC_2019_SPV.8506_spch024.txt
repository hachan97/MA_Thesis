Mr. Polyanskiy (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I will be very brief. It is just to clarify the
situation of vaccines. I just wanted to say that the
Government of Venezuela was ready to buy the vaccines
but, as I said, the money that had been deposited in
British and American banks was stolen from it.

It is very simple. First, the problem is created. It
is then proposed that it be resolved. That is by way
of clarification.
