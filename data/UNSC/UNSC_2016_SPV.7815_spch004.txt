Mr. Shen Bo (China): China welcomes the Security
Council's unanimous adoption ofresolution 2319 (2016).
Our position on the question of chemical weapons is

clear and consistent. We are firmly opposed to the use
of chemical weapons by any country, organization
individual in any circumstances.
China is deeply concerned about and strongly
condemns the use of chemical materials as weapons in
Syria. China has always called on the Joint Investigative
Mission of the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons and the United Nations to discharge
its duty in accordance with the mandate and in a fair,
objective and professional manner. Resolution 2319
(2016) contains many positive elements, including
that the Joint Implementation Mechanism, in its future
mandate, will give more attention to the use of chemical
weapons by non-State actors and will exchange more
information with Syria's neighbouring countries.

China hopes that the Joint Investigative Mechanism
will, on the basis of the respect of the sovereignty of the
countries concerned, strengthen coordination with the
Syrian Government to thoroughly investigate the use of
chemical weapons so as to unveil the truth. China also
hopes that the Council will continue to keep the unity
we have seen here on the Syrian chemical-weapons issue
so as to play a positive role in the ultimate elimination
of chemical weapons in Syria and in the maintenance
of peace and security in the country, contribute to the
resolution of the Syrian conflict by political means
and help with the comprehensive, durable and proper
resolution of the situation in Syria.
