The President (spoke in French): On behalf of
the Council, I wish to thank the Chairman of the 1540
Committee, Ambassador Urbina, and his predecessor,
Mr. Burian, as well as the group of experts for their
work. The final report submitted to the Council today
bears witness to the progress that has been achieved
thanks to their endeavours. It also demonstrates the
scale of the task that remains to be performed.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list; the Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 10.20 am.
