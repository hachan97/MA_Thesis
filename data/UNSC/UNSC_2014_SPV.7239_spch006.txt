Mr. Zhao Yong (China) (spoke in Chinese): I wish
to thank Assistant Secretary-General Simonovie for his
briefing.

Armed conflicts have continued to escalate in
eastern Ukraine, resulting in severe casualties and
property damage. China is deeply concerned about the
situation.

In armed conflicts, civilians are the most fragile
and vulnerable group. Three days ago, Mr. Ging of the
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
briefed Council members here in this Chamber on the
humanitarian situation in Ukraine.

The international community should call on all
parties to take, as soon as possible, actions aimed at
easing the situation in Ukraine, building mutual trust
and finding a political solution to the crisis. The priority
now is to implement an immediate ceasefire through
political consultations, carry out a comprehensive
dialogue and, on the basis of initiatives such as the
Geneva agreement, fully leverage the role of existing
dialogue and the liaison mechanism in search of a
comprehensive political solution.

The Ukrainian crisis can be addressed only
through political means. In that process, the legitimate
demands of all sides and ethnic groups have to be fully
accommodated in order to achieve a balance ofinterests
for all. The international community should also play a
constructive role in seeking a political solution to the
crisis by vigorously engaging in mediation, pushing for
talks, encouraging the parties concerned to maintain
dialogue and increased engagement, and creating
favourable external conditions for effective interaction
among all parties.

China supports all efforts aimed at easing the
situation, ending the crisis and promoting a political
solution. We stand ready to work with other members
of the international community to continue to play an
active and constructive role in that regard.
