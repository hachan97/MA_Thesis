The President: Just as we ask United Nations
Secretariat colleagues and those in the field to
constantly innovate, our presidency is innovating with
regard to interaction. 1 will now turn to our briefers
to respond to the questions put so far, of which I have
counted approximately 15. I hope that will prompt those
who have not yet spoken to pick up on those responses
or related issues. I ask the briefers to be brief in their
responses so that the work on the Council can continue.

1 now give the floor to Mr. Jean-Pierre Lacroix to
respond to the comments and questions raised.
