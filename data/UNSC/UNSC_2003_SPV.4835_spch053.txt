The President: That concludes the speakers' list
as I have it.

There was a question of whether or not there
would be a need to respond to some of the points made.
Given the number of legal questions that have arisen, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite Mr.
Hans Corell, the Legal Counsel of the United Nations,
to take a seat at the table in accordance with rule 39 of
the Council's provisional rules of procedure and to give
a brief resume from his particular expertise on actually
where we are on this issue. That would be done with
Mr. Annabi's approval - he is waving in response in
favour of Mr. Corell. I am grateful to them both for
their cooperation on this matter.

I give the floor to Mr. Corell.
