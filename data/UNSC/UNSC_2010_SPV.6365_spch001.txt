The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Ibrahim Gambari,
Joint African Union-United Nations Special
Representative for Darfur.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Gambari to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

I wish to draw the attention of members to the
report of the Secretary-General on the African Union-
United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, contained
in document S/20lO/382.

At this meeting, the Council will hear a briefing
by Mr. Ibrahim Gambari, to whom I now give the floor.
