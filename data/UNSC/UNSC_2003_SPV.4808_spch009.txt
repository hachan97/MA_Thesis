Mr. Gatilov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation has consistently
advocated that the United Nations should play an
enhanced role in the political settlement of the situation
in Iraq. We are convinced that the resolution of the
complex problems facing that country can be achieved
only through the consistent efforts of the entire
international community, with the United Nations and
the Security Council playing a decisive role.
It is necessary to fully restore the sovereignty of
Iraq as soon as possible and give to the Iraqi people the
right to independently manage the resources of their
country. Conditions should be created to ensure that the
Iraqi people are able to choose a legitimate and
internationally recognized Government that can help
resolve the crisis in the country.

From the outset, Russia has supported a Council
decision on establishing the United Nations Assistance
Mission for Iraq. The resolution adopted today, with
our active participation, fully reflects Russia's position
supporting the Secretary-General's recommendations to
deploy a full-fledged United Nations mission to play an
important role in resolving the crisis and rebuilding
Iraq. The resolution is in keeping with Russia's
approach to the creation of the temporary Governing
Council in Iraq, which is an important first step
towards establishing an internationally recognized
Government and restoring State sovereignty.

We hope that this Council decision, in addition to
its resolution 1483 (2003), will give added impetus to
increasing the real participation of the United Nations
in the Iraqi post-war process, leading to the solid
settlement of the Iraqi problem in keeping with
international law.
