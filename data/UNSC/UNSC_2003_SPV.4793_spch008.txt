Mr. Diarra (Cote d'Ivoire) (spoke in French): I
thank you, Sir, for your attention to this briefing. I will
be available for any questions. I thank the Council for
holding this meeting today.

Today, we are in the process of emerging from the
crisis. The guns have fallen silent. We are now
attempting to get the Cote d'Ivoire to work, to resume
our activities from the past, working with all
neighbouring countries in the subregion. You have
seen, Sir, that we have stressed social reintegration in
our briefing. It is an important programme. In our
country, if we do not get children back to work, we
would be leaving them to destabilizing forces, to all
those who would try to use them to destabilize the
country. Our programme is doing everything possible
so that by 2005, when our mission ends, we will have
carried out the maximum number of reintegrations
among the youth population, while stressing the
campaign against HIV/AIDS.

I wish to reaffirm that the goal of the Government
of National Reconciliation is to bring about just, open
and transparent elections in 2005.
