Mr. Strammen (Norway): Let me also commend
you, Madam President, for the manner in which you
have conducted the work of the Security Council
during the month of November.

I will limit my comments to a few issues. First,
we welcome the high degree of openness exercised
during the month, for non-permanent members in
particular. Openness and transparency in the way the
Security Council conducts its business is of high
importance.

Secondly, we regret that on certain occasions
background documentation continues to be made
available late in the process leading up to a meeting,
allowing little or virtually no time for proper
preparation of the subject matter at hand.

Thirdly, the thematic issues considered during
this month, relating to children and armed conflict, as
well as protection of civilians in armed conflict,
contributed importantly to the needed
comprehensiveness in the design of peacekeeping
operations. Let me also take this opportunity to thank
Ambassador Ward for his efforts with regard to the
Working Group on Peacekeeping Operations.

Last but not least - and this will not come as a
surprise to any member of the Council - Norway
maintains its position that brief interventions, as
opposed to long ones, facilitate the way we conduct
business.
