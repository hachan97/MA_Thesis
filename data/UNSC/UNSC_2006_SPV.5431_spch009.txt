Mr. Manongi (United Republic of Tanzania):
The United Republic of Tanzania voted in favour of the
resolution extending the mandate of the United Nations
Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara.
However, it is our View that the right of self-
determination of the people of Western Sahara cannot
be subject to any preconditions. As it is, it has gone
unfulfilled for far too long. It is our hope that the next
six months will witness real progress towards the
realization of that right.
