The President: I wish to remind speakers to
limit their statements to no more than four minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate their texts in writing and
to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber. I would also like to appeal to speakers to
deliver their statements at a reasonable speed so that
interpretation may be provided accurately.

I also wish to inform all concerned that we will be
carrying on this open debate right through the lunch
hour, as we have a large number of speakers.

I now give the floor to the representative of Mexico.
