Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): I wish at
the outset to welcome Catherine Ashton, High
Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy
of the European Union, and to thank her for the
information she has shared with us. I also thank the
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Austria for his
statement here today.

Of late, our debates have recognized that
cooperation between the United Nations and regional
organizations is of fundamental importance to our
efforts to maintain international peace and security.
Similarly, timely involvement by those organizations in
the peaceful settlement of disputes and in the
peacebuilding process is essential to maintain medium-
and long-term stability.

Mexico therefore supports the work of the
European Union, with its new international outreach
under the Lisbon Treaty, as a strategic partner of the
United Nations in promoting peace and protecting
vulnerable individuals in particularly critical regional
conflicts, such as those mentioned by the High
Representative in her statement. We encourage the
European Union to continue strengthening its strategic
relationship with the United Nations in the framework
of the provisions of the Charter and to redouble its
efforts to provide technical cooperation in building the
national and regional capacity that is needed to prevent
or ease conflicts, promote and protect human rights and
strengthen the rule of law.

We welcome the fact that in many of its activities
in this sphere, the European Union seeks to pool its
efforts with those of other regional or subregional
organizations and of actors on the ground. As part of its
strategic association with the European Union, Mexico
reaffirms its readiness to continue developing
frameworks for triangular cooperation that, with
imagination and goodwill, will enable us to pool our
efforts and attain our shared objectives.
