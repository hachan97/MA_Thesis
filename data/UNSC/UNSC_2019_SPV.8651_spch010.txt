Mr. Djani (Indonesia): I would like to begin by
reiterating my delegation's full support for the political
process led by the good offices of the Secretary-
General. Indonesia commends President Horst Kohler,
the former Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General, for
his tireless efforts to revive the political process, which
injected new and positive momentum in encouraging
the parties to resume direct talks and find a durable
solution to their dispute. It is important to ensure that
the Council, together with all the relevant stakeholders,
maintains that new momentum and builds on the
accomplishments made so far. My delegation would
therefore like to stress the need for the Secretary-
General to appoint his next Personal Envoy without
delay. And while that is a matter of urgency, it must
be someone who is credible and acceptable to all
the parties.

Indonesia would also like to express its appreciation
for the United Nations Mission for the Referendum
in Western Sahara (MINURSO) and underscore the
pivotal role it plays. The Mission's mandate is crucial
to maintaining peace and stability in the region, which
is a necessary condition for the peace talks involving
all parties. Indonesia, as a troop-contributing country,
including to MINURSO, supports the l2-month
mandate renewal for the Mission. It will create a better
sense of certainty and predictability and improve the
Mission's ability to manage its planning and operations.
At the same time, it will also provide the Secretary-
General and his incoming Envoy with sufficient room
to prepare for the forthcoming political process.

We want to thank the United States, as the
penholder, for preparing the text of resolution 2494
(2019). We also commend the constructive engagement
all the parties with the political process. We call on
them to remain committed to it and to extend their full
support and cooperation to the future Personal Envoy
in working for a mutually acceptable political solution.
