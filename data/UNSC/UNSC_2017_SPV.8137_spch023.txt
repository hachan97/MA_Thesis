Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I will be very brief. I am not going to get into
a substantive discussion with the Foreign Minister of
Ukraine. I just want to say that I am glad that there
are a lot of people in the Chamber today, because they
have been able to see for themselves the Ukrainian
delegation's lack of respect for the Security Council
and other Member States.
