Mr. Musayev (Azerbaijan): I am sorry to ask
for the floor so late in the day. It is unfortunate that
the representative of Armenia has once again used
the opportunity of our debate to make groundless,
propagandistic statements. In fact, the delegation of
Armenia has once again abused its right to speak from
the lofty rostrum of the United Nations.

The representative of Armenia did not even want
to take the trouble to listen carefully to what I said and
instead preferred to read out a written text containing
the set of standard falsifications. As a result, we have
heard irrelevant and out-of-context comments that
obviously failed to respond to our arguments.
