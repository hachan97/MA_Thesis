Mr. Essonghe (Gabon) (interpretation from French):
The draft resolution that we are about to adopt attests to
the Security Council's will to stem the current crisis in
Abkhazia, Georgia, and to re-establish relations of peace
and mutual respect there.

In this regard, the efforts of the sponsors to produce
the final text should be emphasized. Similarly, the Geneva
peace process, launched at the Secretary-General's
initiative and supported by the group of his Friends, the
Russian Federation and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe is to be welcomed.

In this context, the second meeting, held in Geneva
from 23 to 25 July 1998, seemed to us to be a hopeful
sign, since the two parties were to contribute, alongside
the international protagonists, to the search for ways and
means to put an end to this crisis. Unfortunately, we are
obliged to concede that this goal remains far from being
achieved.

The draft resolution under our consideration notes,
in its third preambular paragraph, that the situation in the
Zugdidi and Gali regions remains tense and
confrontational and that there is a risk of resumed
fighting. This sorry assessment is a source of keen
concern, which my delegation shares and, quite naturally,
wishes to see changed. That is why the Security Council's
appeal, in paragraph 8 of the draft resolution, seems to
me to deserve our firm support.

My delegation will therefore vote in favour of the
draft resolution.
