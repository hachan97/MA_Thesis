The President: There are no more names on the list
of speakers.

I would like to express the sincere appreciation
of the delegation of Lithuania to the members of the
Council and their respective staff and to the Secretariat
of the Council for all the support they have given us
during our presidency. Indeed, it has been a busy
month, one in which the Council rallied to consensus
on important issues within its purview. I thank all
delegations for their hard work, support and positive

contributions. I know l speak on behalf of the Council
when I wish the delegation of Malaysia good luck in the
month of June.

The meeting rose at 1.40pm.
