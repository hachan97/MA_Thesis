The President (spoke in French): In accordance

consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Judge Claude Jorda, President of the
International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons
Responsible for Serious Violations of International
Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Judge Jorda to take a seat at the Council
