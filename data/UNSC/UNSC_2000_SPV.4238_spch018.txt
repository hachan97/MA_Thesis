Mr. Harrison (United Kingdom): My delegation
would like to thank you, Madam President, and your
Mission for taking the initiative of holding this debate
today. It is important not just for Guinea-Bissau, but
also for demonstrating how this Council can take a
holistic approach to the problems of conflict. My
delegation would also like to thank the Secretary-
General for his very thoughtful introduction to today's
debate.

The Permanent Representative of France has just
spoken on behalf of the European Union, and my
delegation endorses everything he has said. I would
just therefore like to make three brief points.

First, we were very grateful for the speech made
by the Vice-Prime Minister of Guinea-Bissau, in which
he reiterated his Government's intentions to restore
political and economic stability to the country, which
we welcome. We believe that the recent stand-off
between the Government and the junta leader, General
Mane, has shown that the military is prepared to
support a democratically elected civilian president.
That said, we believe that the demobilization of
Guinea-Bissau's very large post-conflict army, which
has as many as 25,000 men, is a very high priority and
a political and economic necessity.

Finally, I think this debate has shown, as we
believe, that now is the right time for the international
community to demonstrate its support for Guinea-
Bissau.
