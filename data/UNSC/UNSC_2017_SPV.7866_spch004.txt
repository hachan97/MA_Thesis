Mr. Rosselli (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish):
Uruguay thanks Senegal for its efforts within the
Council and in Africa with respect to the situation in
The Gambia.

However, as a member of the Accountability,
Coherence and Transparency group, I note that we
should have preferred the negotiating process on
resolution 2337 (2017), which we have just adopted,
had been undertaken in a more inclusive manner. The
resolution was circulated on Tuesday evening, with
only a brief window for comments and without face-to-
face negotiations, and was then put to a brief silence
procedure before being issued in blue, which did not
allow the various legitimate concerns expressed by
Council members to be taken into account. Moreover, it
was not made available in all official languages of the
United Nations. Uruguay recognizes that the Security
Council had to act urgently and take a timely decision
in this instance, but that does not justify the failure
to open the process to the dialogue and inclusiveness
required when negotiating any draft resolution.

Uruguay, as a champion of the rule of law,
democracy and the the freedom of expression, expresses
its support for the will ofthe Gambian people, expressed
in the elections of 1 December 2016. In that regard,
we were alarmed by the measures adopted by former
President Jammeh, which represented a violation of the
Constitution that threatened peace in the The Gambia
and regional stability, and gave rise to the need for the
resolution we have just adopted.

Uruguay reiterates its position, pursuant to
Article 53 of the Charter of the United Nations, that
no enforcement action shall be taken under regional
arrangements or by regional agencies without
the authorization of the Security Council. Such
authorization must be express, affirmative and prior.
Uruguay underscores that nothing in resolution 2337
(2017) can be interpreted as express authorization of
the use of force.
