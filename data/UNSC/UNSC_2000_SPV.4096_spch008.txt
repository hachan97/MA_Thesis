Ms. Dlamini-Zuma (South Africa): First, my
Government would like to thank the delegation of the
United States for devoting the month of its presidency of
the Security Council to Africa. I would also like to thank
the Secretary-General for all the efforts he has devoted to
solving African problems. We have, indeed, come to the
end of an extraordinary month in the Security Council
during which various difficult issues relating to Africa
have been discussed, some for the very first time. We
may not have found lasting solutions to these issues, but
we have, indeed, made some progress towards achieving
lasting peace. It has been Africa's privilege for several of
our Presidents to appear before this body.

Quite understandably, much of the attention has been
focused on the few conflict areas in Africa, which
threaten the lives, liberty and homes of so many of our
people. The cost in blood and lost opportunities of the
conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Angola, Burundi and Sierra Leone is already far too high.
President Chiluba has eloquently given details about the
various conflicts and what needs to be done, and my
brother, Mr. Gurirab, has done the same. Of course, in
my culture, I would not have spoken after President
Chiluba and my brother; in my culture, youths do not
speak after their elders. But I have to obey the protocol
of the Security Council.
