The President (spoke in French): I thank the
representative of Algeria for the kind words he
addressed to me.

We fully agree that the Millennium Declaration
and the Agenda for Peace are fundamental documents
and that we all must take a multidimensional approach
to contemporary challenges to peace and security. We
are convinced that today's debate will bear fruit and
yield innovative approaches, including those proposed
by the representative of Algeria, as well as genuine
partnerships between the United Nations and regional
and subregional organizations.

(spoke in English)

I now call on the Deputy Assistant Secretary-
General for Political Affairs of NATO, Mr. Robert F.
Simmons.
