Mr. Ladeb (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): Tunisia voted in favour of resolution 2542 (2020), since we believe it is important to support the United Nations Support Mission in Libya. Tunisia will continue to make every effort to assist the Mission and to help our Libyan brothers to make progress towards a comprehensive lasting settlement through intra-Libyan dialogue and to alleviate the suffering of the Libyan people so as to restore stability and peace to Libya and the neighbouring countries. We thank the United Kingdom, as penholder, and all other countries for their contributions towards achieving the adoption of the resolution. The meeting rose at 12.20 p.m.
