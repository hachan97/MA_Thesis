Mr. Pham (Viet Nam): At the outset. I would like to thank you, Sir, in your capacity as a Chair of the Committee established pursuant to resolution 751 (1992), concerning Somalia, for your briefing. We commend the efforts of the Federal Government of Somalia and its recent constructive cooperation with the Panel of Experts and look forward to their continued collaborative efforts. We support the important role the Somalia Sanctions Committee and of the Panel to implement their functions and mandates under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, especially their central role in overseeing the implementation of the sanctions regime with regard to Somalia. We would like to emphasize that the Committee should discuss specific recommendations thoroughly, with the assistance of the Panel, to ensure the full implementation of the sanctions measures put forth by the Council. As noted by the Chair, the Committee should also pay attention to the practicalities of the situation in Somalia, including the legitimate concerns and requests of the Federal Government of Somalia. In that connection, it should make sure that sanctions measures are targeted correctly and do not affect capacity- building and other national development plans. We find it necessity to take into account the need to alleviate any misperceptions about sanctions measures. At the same time, the Committee and the Panel should continuously pay close attention to the situation on the ground and make the necessary adjustments to the sanctions regime as appropriate.
