Mr. Minton (United States of America): I will be
brief. I should like to thank Mr. Annabi for his comments
on the Judicial System Assessment Programme (J SAP). We
understand, of course, the specific functions outlined in the
mandate of resolution 1247 (1999) with regard to judicial
reform. However, the United States still believes that
"inspect, observe and monitor" will not allow adequate
implementation of the JSAP reports and
recommendations. Therefore we look forward to hearing
from Mr. Annabi or from the United Nations Mission in
Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH) about plans on how
the work in this sector could be divided among those
involved - that is, UNMIBH and perhaps organizations
like the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE), which might enjoy a somewhat broader
mandate in this area.
