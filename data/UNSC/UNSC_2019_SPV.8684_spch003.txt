The President: I thank Ambassador Wronecka
for her briefing. We also express our thanks and
appreciation for Ambassador Wronecka's leadership of
the 1591 Committee over the past two years and for the
hard work exhibited by her team in the fulfilment of
its mandate.

I now give the floor to the representative of
the Sudan.
