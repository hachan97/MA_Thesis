Mr. Begec (Turkey): I have asked for the floor to
reply to the statement made by the representative of
Syria.

The Turkish position on the political, security and
humanitarian aspects of the Syrian conflict were shared
yesterday with the United Nations membership at the
highest political level. I have nothing to add on that
score, yet I wish to emphasize our dismay with certain
parts of the statement delivered by the representative
of the regime. The statement contained distorted facts
and baseless accusations, including some levelled at
Turkey. We reject them in their entirety.

This meeting, on the other hand, was instrumental
in facilitating the exchange of views at the political
level with regard to matters of mutual interest and
importance concerning Syria. However, the utility of
the meeting could have been considerably enhanced
should the voice of the genuine representative of the
people Syria, from the High Negotiations Committee,
be heard as well. We are confident that such a day will
come soon. We are equally confident that, eventually,
those responsible for the destruction of Syria and the
suffering of the Syrian people will be held accountable
for the crimes they have committed. Until then, Turkey
will stand by the democratic expressions of the Syrian
people.

The meeting rose at 12.40p.m.
