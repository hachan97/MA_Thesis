The President (spoke in Russian): I thank the representative of Germany for what he said about us, but I would just like to note that our lengthy journey and return home began in July, during the German presidency of the Security Council, with Germany's efforts to return first to the Secretariat and then to the Chamber. Therefore, the German delegation pioneered this journey, as did subsequent presidencies, which was supported by all States members of the Security Council. I want to thank all my colleagues at this meeting, once again, for supporting the idea of returning to the Security Council Chamber.
