Mr. Hmoud (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): Jordan
voted in favor of resolution 2209 (2015), introduced by
the United States, related to the use of chemical weapons
in Syria. The resolution prohibits the use of chemical
weapons in Syria. We voted based on our conviction
that the Security Council must deal with the issue in
accordance with its prerogatives under the Charter
of the United Nations The use of weapons of mass
destruction in Syria would have serious consequences
for the country and the region.

Jordan condemns the use of all chemical weapons
in Syria. It stresses that those who perpetrate such acts
must be prosecuted. These are war crimes and crimes
against humanity, perpetrated against thousands of
innocent civilians. The perpetrators must not be above
the law. Furthermore, Jordan fully the supports the
activities of the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons fact-finding mission. We stress
the need to take its conclusions into consideration, in
particular those pertaining to the use of chlorine as
a weapon in Syria. That is a crime and a violation of
international humanitarian law and of international
criminal law, as well as of resolution 2118 (2013). Such
acts are indeed a threat to international peace and
security. Jordan stresses that measures under Chapter
VII of the Charter of the United Nations should be
imposed in the case ofnon-implementation ofresolution
2118 (2013) and that a monitoring mechanism should
be put in place to ensure that chemical weapons and
facilities are never again used in Syria.
