Ms. Wronecka (Poland): Poland voted against the
draft resolution contained in document S/2019/757.
Let me reiterate that it is both our moral and legal
obligation to provide immediate, full, safe and
unhindered access to humanitarian aid and to prevent
the human catastrophe unfolding in Idlib province. It
is equally important that all activities undertaken by
States aimed at countering terrorism be fully in line
with their obligations under international humanitarian
and human rights law. Countering terrorism must not
serve as a pretext for violations of human rights, nor
can there be any justification for the indiscriminate
targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure.

Poland continues to strongly condemn any acts
of terror and remains deeply committed to the fight
against terrorism. The draft resolution proposed by the
Russian Federation and China is missing this important
point. Therefore, we were not in a position to support it.
