Mr. Aboulatta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): My
delegation voted in favour of resolution 2297 (2016),
reauthorizing the African Union Mission in Somalia
(AMISOM), as we believe in the important role it plays
in support of the peace and reconciliation process in
Somalia through the efforts and sacrifices its personnel
have made since 2007. My delegation affirms that the
positive developments witnessed in Somalia could not
have been achieved without those efforts to provide an
environment conducive to the ongoing political efforts
of all parties in that country.

Those efforts have energized international support
for the political process and allowed the Security
Council to send a clear message through its visit
to Somalia in May concerning the importance of
concluding the electoral process as soon as possible.
The timing of that visit was highly instrumental in
supporting the reconciliation process and facilitating
the adoption of the electoral calendar for 2016. In that
context, I commend the efforts of President Hassan
Sheikh Mohamud, his Prime Minister and Government,
and all federal leaders to adopt the electoral model and
launch the procedural and logistical arrangements for
its implementation.

My delegation affirms its support for the peace and
reconciliation efforts in Somalia and urges all parties to
build on their achievements in order to end the prolonged
conflict and to support the Somali President's call for
the coordination of support, in particular in training and
capacity-building for Somalia's national institutions
so that the Government can assume responsibility
for ensuring peace and security. We also support the
Secretary-General's cooperation with the African
Union with a view to undertaking a joint assessment of
AMISOM. in support ofthe next phase of State-building
in Somalia. We appreciate all efforts being made to that
end.
