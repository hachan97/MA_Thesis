The President: I very grateful to the Ambassador of
China for setting an example on brevity. I am told that
my own contribution lasted 4 minutes and 55 seconds,
and so came within the five-minute limit.

The next speaker is the Ambassador of the United
States. As a son of Africa myself, I am delighted to say
that he has just returned from Africa. Everybody who
visits Africa comes back a better person, and I am sure
that that applies to him, too.
