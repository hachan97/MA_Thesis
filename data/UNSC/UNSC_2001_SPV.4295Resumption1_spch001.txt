The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Cuba, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Dausd
Cespedes (Cuba) took a seat at the side of the
Council Chamber.

The President: Members of the Council have
received photocopies of a letter dated 14 March 2001
from the Permanent Representative of Malaysia to the
United Nations, which will be issued as document
S/2001/231.
