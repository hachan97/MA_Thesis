Mr. Motoc (Romania): Romania could not
support the draft resolution before the Council today
and abstained in the vote just taken. The text, in our
View, did not reflect amendments submitted, which
fairly describe the facts and responsibilities on both
sides - Israel's and the Palestinians' - with regard to
both the recent dramatic events and their reciprocal
obligations to prevent the escalation of violence.
Romania remains deeply concerned about the
deterioration of the security situation on the ground
and the fate of numerous Palestinians who are suffering
from the consequences of the Israeli military incursion.

As we have stated many times before, we
recognize the right of the State of Israel to defend its
citizens, but this right may be exercised only within the
boundaries of international law. We remain of the view
that operations such as the one in northern Gaza are not
helpful for the security of Israel.

There can be no solution through military means
to the conflict in the Middle East. We encourage the
parties to resume talks and agree to a cease-fire in
order to stop the bloodshed. As stated before, a just,
comprehensive and lasting peace can be achieved only
through negotiations, as envisaged in the road map and
in accordance with the provisions of the relevant
resolutions of the Security Council.
