Mr. Sergeyev (Ukraine): I would like to thank
you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting. I also
thank Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman for his
briefing.

I would like to start by expressing my Government's
sorrow and deep condolences to all the Missions whose
citizens were killed in the terrible crash of Malaysia
Airlines Flight MH-17. Ukraine shares the pain of
their loss and grieves with their bereaved families and
friends. My country extends its profound sympathy to
those affected by the accident. Today, all of Ukraine
is mourning. Ukrainians are visiting the Embassies of
the Netherlands, Malaysia, Australia, Indonesia, the
United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, the Philippines

and Canada in order to leave flowers and express their
sorrow.

The Ukrainian authorities have already called on
international organizations, including the International
Civil Aviation Organization, Interpol and others, to
undertake a thorough international investigation of the
accident. We believe that an impartial investigation
will reveal the truth and that all perpetrators will be
punished.

Yesterday, the Ukrainian leadership announced a
basic version of what happened with the flight: it was
an act of terror. The position of our Government is
based on converging data from different intelligence
and open sources, which show that the aircraft was
shot down over territory controlled by terrorists. Two
Ukrainian jets were shot down near the same location
several days before, with terrorist leaders claiming
responsibility for those acts. Intercepted telephone
conversations between the terrorist leaders and their
coordinator - Russian military intelligence colonel
Vasili Geranin - confirm that terrorists are behind
this crime. That conversation was recorded, and the
Secretariat has promised to convey it to members of the
Security Council.

Immediately after the crash, the military leader of
the terrorists, Igor Girkin Strelkov, who is of Russian
origin, boasting on social networks, commented on
having shot down what he believed to be a Ukrainian
jet, saying the following.

"In Torez, Ukraine, an AN-26 has been shot down.
It is lying somewhere near the Progress coal mine.
We have warned everyone not to fly in our skies".

To target and shoot down an aeroplane at an
altitude of as high as 10 kilometres would be possible
only by using a sophisticated anti-aircraft system, such
as the SA-ll Buk missile system, or a similar system.
It has been affirmed both by the radio interception
of terrorist leaders and by photographs and video-
recordings obtained from citizens of cities in the area,
that the terrorists have at least two SA-ll Buk missile
systems. The question is, where did they get those
sophisticated anti-defence systems? I reiterate that
radio interceptions, photographs and the confessions
of detained terrorists, including two recently detained
Russian citizens who were going to join the terrorists as
military experts, state that the Buk system came from
Russia. All that and other evidence and information
will be provided to the international investigation.

This tragedy would not have been possible if Russia
had not supported the terrorists and if a sophisticated
anti-aircraft system had not been provided to them from
Russia. On many occasions, the Ukrainian Mission to
the United Nations has addressed the Security Council
and all States Members of the United Nations and has
given them information about Russia's support for
the terrorists in eastern Ukraine. Only yesterday, we
presented new evidence to United Nations-accredited
media. The huge supply of weapons of Russian origin
being used by terrorists in Donbas, which has been
documented by the Ukrainian intelligence agencies,
the media and the general public, is no longer a secret
to anyone. A large exhibition of confiscated modern
weapons, seized by the Ukrainian military forces from
terrorist groups, took place in Kyiv a few days ago. In
most cases, the actual military units of the Russian
armed forces are specified as the origin of those
weapons. The documentation can be accessed on the
website of the Ukrainian Mission and from my press
conference yesterday, which can be found on the United
Nations website.

We have raised our concern several times here
in the Chamber that Russian nationals are directly
participating in destabilizing the situation in eastern
Ukraine. Some colleagues have today given some
information about the Luhansk and Donetsk leaders
proclaiming republics. All their military commanders
are of Russian origin. Illegal armed groups of fighters
are stepping up their recruitment efforts within Russia.
They seek volunteers with experience in operating heavy
weapons, such as tanks and air defence equipment.
Russia has allowed the establishment of recruitment
offices in Moscow and Rostov, which are openly
recruiting and sending Russian nationals to Ukraine's
eastern regions. Yesterday at the press conference, we
described all the websites that are calling for recruits.
Numerous groups of Russian paramilitary formations,
including Russian Cossacks, are actively supporting the
terrorists in spreading terror and chaos in the eastern
part of Ukraine.

Throughout the entire period of such articifically
created confrontations, supported by Russia, that
country has never publically called on its citizens to
refrain from joining the illegal armed groups operating
on the territory of Ukraine. That fact speaks for itself.
Paragraph 2 of article 208 of the criminal code of the
Russian Federation states the following.

"Participation in armed groups that are not

governed by federal law, as well as participation

in such armed groups on the territory of a foreign

State for any purpose against the interests of the

Russian Federation, is punishable by 5 to 10 years'

imprisonment".

Since no Russian national has been brought to
justice for such actions, there is only one conclusion:
their participation in illegal armed groups on the
territory of Ukraine does not contradict the interests of
the Russian Federation.

The situation on the Ukrainian-Russian State
border has significantly deteriorated in recent days as a
result of systematic violations coming from the Russian
side of the border, as well as the provocative actions of
armed terrorist groups in the border areas of the Donetsk
and Luhansk regions. Several times a day, columns of
military vehicles and Russian mercenaries attempt to
break through the Ukrainian State border from the
Russian side. Such attempts are actively facilitated
by Russian border protection units. The anti-terrorist
forces in Ukraine have been repeatedly shelled from the
territory of Russia. Ukraine has documented evidence
of all those facts for the appropriate international
response.

The number of provocations on the Ukrainian-
Russian State border has increased substantially.
Illegal armed groups systematically fire towards the
territory of Russia in order to create the false image
of Ukrainian military fire. That caused the death of a
Russian citizen. The Russian side accused the armed
forces of Ukraine of shelling on Russian territory on
28 June, namely, Mine No. 24 of Vasetskaya village in
the Krasnosulynsky district of the Rostov region and
the Gukovo border checkpoint. The Ukrainian armed
forces have never attacked or fired on the territory
of Russia. All such provocations are committed by
pro-Russian terrorists in order to find grounds for a
further escalation. Today's statement by the Russian
Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, about the possibility
of carrying out strikes against the territory of Ukraine
sounds like a new provocation.

Today, colleagues have presented some evidence
of the deteriorating situation on the Ukrainian-Russian
border. Every day during the month of July, we have
observed such violations, including the shooting-down
of Ukrainian jets. I would like to take this opportunity
to once again draw the attention of members of the
Security Council to the fact that Russia continues to
redeploy new forces extremely close to the Ukrainian
border. As of 14 July, the total number of groups of
Russian armed forces in the areas bordering Ukraine
has significantly increased. They comprise 33 battalion
tactical groups, with a total of at least 40,000 troops
directly around Ukraine, including up to 18,000 troops
in Transnistria and up to 21,000 troops in the occupied
territory ofCrimea. Those and similar actions constitute
a flagrant violation by Russia of its obligations under
the Charter of the United Nations and other universally
recognized principles and norms of international law.
Those actions are incompatible with the obligations of
the Russian Federation under the Geneva agreement of

17 April and the Berlin declaration of2 June.

Despite all the international efforts, supported by
the strong Ukrainian will to prevent a further escalation
and further strengthened by the President's peace plan,
the foreign terrorists and their Russian supporters have
no intention of leaving us in peace or laying down their
arms. We are still struggling against high-capacity
military saboteurs who are willing to destroy Ukraine
and to establish havens for chaos and instability.

Ukraine demands that the Russian side immediately
cease provocations on the State border of Ukraine, stop
hindering the efforts of the Ukrainian side and the
international community to put an end to terrorism and
other violence in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, return
to President Poroshenko's peace plan, withdraw its
forces from the Ukrainian border and stop threatening
peace and security in our country, the region and the
world as a whole.
