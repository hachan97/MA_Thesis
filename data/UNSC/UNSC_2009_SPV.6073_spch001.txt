The President (spoke in French): I propose with
the consent of the Council to extend an invitation under
rule 39 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure
to Mr. Said Djinnit, Special Representative of the
Secretary-General and head of the United Nations
Office for West Africa.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Djinnit to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document 8/2009/39, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the United Nations Office for
West Africa.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Said Djinnit, Special Representative of
the Secretary-General and head of the United Nations
Office for West Africa, to whom I give the floor.
