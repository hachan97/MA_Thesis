Mr. Okamura (Japan) (spoke in French): My
Permanent Representative, Ambassador Yoshikawa,
has allowed me to deliver this statement on the occasion
of today's adoptions, as I was personally present in the
Ivorian crisis exactly five years ago. The worst of the
Ivorian crisis took place in April 2011, while I was
Japan's Ambassador in C6te d'Ivoire, during which
my residence was attacked. The French army and the
United Nations Operation in Cote d'Ivoire (UNOCI)
saved my life and that of my colleagues. I once again
extend my thanks to the courageous French operation
and to UNOCI. It is for that reason that I am very moved
to be here today.

Japan welcomes the unanimous adoption of
resolutions 2283 (2016) and 2284 (2016). We would like
to express our sincere appreciation to the Permanent
Mission of France for taking the lead in preparing the
resolutions. I would also like to take this opportunity
to thank the Chair of the sanctions committee, the
Permanent Representative of Uruguay, and to the Group
of Experts for their dedication to their work.

Throughout the period of the sanctions regime,
cote d'Ivoire made undeniable, outstanding progress in
consolidating peace. Japan would like to commend Cote
d'Ivoire for its perseverance in the effort of stabilizing
the country. Some issues remain, but Japan has trust
that C6te d'Ivoire and the Ivorian people will rise up to
those challenges.

We would also like to pay tribute to UNOCI for
its work and its commitment to peace during the past
12 years. The Security Council must make sure that
UNOCI concludes successfully, thereby becoming a
good example United Nations peacekeeping overall.
We hope that the Government of Cote d'Ivoire and
UNOCI will coordinate even more during this final
cycle of the mandate.

Japan will continue to contribute to consolidating
peace and stability in Cote d'Ivoire, both as a
member of the Security Council and as an important
bilateral partner.
