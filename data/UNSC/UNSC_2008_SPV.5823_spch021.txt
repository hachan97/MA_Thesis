Mr. De Mistura: Very briefly, I just want to say
on behalf of all my colleagues in Baghdad, Erbil, Basra
and, hopefully, Kirkuk how much we appreciate the
positive comments, good advice and encouragement of
each of the speakers today in this meeting in the
context of a very constructive period. I will bring them
back to Baghdad and we will certainly look at them
again, because they will help guide us in the future
mission. As I said, 2008 is going to be special and
crucial to all of us.
