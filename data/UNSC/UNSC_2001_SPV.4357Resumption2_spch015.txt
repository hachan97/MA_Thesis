The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the
representative of Lebanon for his kind words addressed
to me.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is Mr. Ali
Abbas, Deputy Permanent Observer of the League of
Arab States to the United Nations, to whom the
Council has extended an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure. I invite him to take a
seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
