Major General Ramos Pereira: As the Force
Commander of the United Nations Stabilization
Mission in Haiti, I now face the challenge of
implementing the new mandate that the Security
Council is seeking on reform. I would like to say that
the situation in Haiti is still stable and under control.
For me and my troops, it is very good to have a very
clear mandate with guidance and the capacity to fulfil
our mission. It is important also to mention that, as the
Council is fully aware, the environment in Haiti is
volatile, so it has to account for the situation there.

If there are more questions, I am available to
answer them.
