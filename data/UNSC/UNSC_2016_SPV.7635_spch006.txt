Mr. Rosselli (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): I would
like to begin by recognizing the presence in the Chamber
of, and express my gratitude to, the Chairperson-in-
Office ofthe Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe (OSCE), Minister for Foreign Affairs of
Gernmany, Mr. Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

For Uruguay, cooperation between the United
Nations and regional organizations under Chapter VIII
of the Charter of the United Nations is an essential
component of the structure of international relations.
As a member of strong regional organizations that
have long been in existence, such as the Organization
of American States and the Community of Latin
American and Caribbean States (CELAC), Uruguay
believes that the role played by regional organizations
is very important. We believe that this role will again
be a central focus, for example in the work that the
Organization will be doing to support the peacebuilding
process in Colombia, specifically with the participation
in that process by the States members of CELAC.

We greatly appreciate the value of the role played

by the OSCE as a platform for dialogue in a very vast
region. In that region, issues related to security, early
warnings, the settlement of conflicts, the management
of crises and post-conflict rehabilitation are all of
crucial importance. In general terms, we share the
values, principles and objectives of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe. In particular,
we value its contribution on the ground to addressing
the various areas of conflict that fall within its remit.
We believe that the United Nations and the OSCE share
work in a number of similar areas and that cooperation
between the two entities should always be a part of the
principles of both organizations.

Finally, I would like to firmly reaffirm that
Uruguay understands that the principle of the
territorial integrity of States is a fundamental pillar in
international relations.
