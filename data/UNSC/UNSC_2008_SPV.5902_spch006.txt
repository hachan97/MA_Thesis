Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): We congratulate you,
Sir, on assuming the presidency of the Security
Council, and we also congratulate the delegation of the
United Kingdom on its excellent stewardship of the
Council during the month of May.

We welcome the adoption of resolution 1816
(2008) today. In negotiating and agreeing to the
resolution, we were guided by the fact that it limits
itself to the situation in Somalia. We should be clear
that it is the situation in Somalia, not piracy in and of
itself, that constitutes a threat to international peace
and security. Piracy is a symptom of the situation in
Somalia.

Furthermore, the resolutions of this Council must
respect the United Nations Convention on the Law of
the Sea. The Convention remains the basis for
cooperation between States on the issue of piracy.

Most importantly, the Council should not lose
focus on the bigger issue in Somalia, specifically the
need to address the political, security and humanitarian
situation on the ground. In that regard, we welcomed
the adoption of resolution 1814 (2008) last month. That
resolution sent a signal to the people of Somalia that
the international community is serious about assisting
them in resolving their conflict.

We reiterate the Council's willingness to consider
at the appropriate time a peacekeeping operation to
take over the African Union Mission in Somalia once
there is progress in the political process and
improvement in the security situation on the ground, as
provided for in resolution 1814 (2008).

We are pleased that the Security Council's visit to
Africa has begun with a discussion on Somalia. We
hope that the visit will provide impetus to the ongoing
international efforts to resolve the conflict in Somalia.
