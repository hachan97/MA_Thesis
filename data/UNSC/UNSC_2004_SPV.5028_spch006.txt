Mr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese):
Respect for sovereignty, independence, territorial
integrity and the principle of non-interference in
internal affairs in international relations constitutes the
centrepiece of China's foreign policy. It is also a
fundamental principle enshrined in the United Nations
Charter. Adhering to that principle, China has always
been resolute in supporting respect for, and the
safeguarding of, the sovereignty, independence and
territorial integrity of Lebanon.

The draft resolution co-sponsored by the United
States and France touches on questions concerning
presidential elections in Lebanon. In our View, those
questions fall within the purview of the internal affairs
of Lebanon and should be freely decided by the
Lebanese people themselves. China is aware that the
Permanent Representative of Lebanon clearly stated, in
his recent letters to the President of the Security
Council and to the Secretary-General, his
Government's objection to the consideration of those
questions by the Council. China respects the wishes of
the Lebanese Government in that regard and hopes that
all Council members will do so. On the basis of that
position, China abstained in the vote on the draft
resolution.

China has been closely following the
developments in Lebanon and sincerely hopes that
Lebanon will continue to maintain its stability and
economic development. That would be in the interests
of peace and stability in the Middle East region and
would prevent new uncertainties from being introduced
into the region.

I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate
China's hope that the parties concerned will be able to
satisfactorily resolve, through political negotiation, all
of their problems, including those of the Palestinian-
Israeli, Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese-Israeli tracks, so
that a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the
Middle East can soon be achieved.
