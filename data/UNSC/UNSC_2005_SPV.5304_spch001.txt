The President (spoke in Russian): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
the agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultation.

Members of the Council have before them

draft resolution submitted by Denmark, the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the
United States of America.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objections, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Algeria, Argentina, Benin, Brazil, China,
Denmark, France, Greece, Japan, Philippines,
Romania, Russian Federation, United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United
Republic of Tanzania, United States of America

The President (spoke in Russian): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1638 (2005).

I will now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements in explanation of
vote.
