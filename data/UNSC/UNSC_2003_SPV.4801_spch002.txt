Mr. Boubacar Diallo (Guinea) (spoke in French): My delegation would like to express its
satisfaction at the unanimous adoption of resolution
1495 (2003) on the United Nations Mission for the
Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), which
reaffirms, if there were need to do so, the shared
concern of the Council to preserve its unity and
credibility.
The compromise that we have achieved following
difficult negotiations opens the way to a new and
dynamic process that will allow the parties involved to
engage in negotiations designed to achieve a just,
lasting and mutually acceptable solution to the question
of the Western Sahara. It is also a sign of the
continuation of constructive dialogue aimed at
achieving a political solution, which clearly will assist
in peace-building and in consolidating solidarity
throughout the Maghreb region.

The second operative paragraph, which calls on
the parties to work with the United Nations and with
each other towards acceptance and implementation of
the Peace plan, fits into that dynamic process.

Once again, we would like to reiterate our sincere
gratitude to the Secretary-General and to his Personal
Envoy, Mr. James Baker, for their tireless efforts to
find a solution to this question. We encourage them to
continue in their lofty task.
