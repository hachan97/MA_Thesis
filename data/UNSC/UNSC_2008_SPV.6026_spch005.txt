Mr. Mantovani (Italy): I would like to
congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the
presidency of the Security Council and to express our
warmest appreciation to Ambassador Urbina of Costa
Rica and his team for the excellent work done during
their presidency last month.

I would like to join other members in welcoming
today's adoption of resolution 1846 (2008), which
renews and improves resolution 1816 (2008) and
makes our collective fight against piracy off the coast
of Somalia even stronger and more coordinated and
effective.

The resolution provides the necessary legal basis
for the adoption of Operation Atalanta by the European
Union, which is expected to begin shortly. It also
provides clear indications and guidelines for Member
States and organizations already operating in the area
with their units, such as NATO.

As in past occasions, I wish to underline once
again that piracy off the coast of Somalia is a
consequence of the political, security and humanitarian
crisis that has been taking place in Somalia for many
years. In order to eliminate piracy, we have a
responsibility to bring peace and stability to that
country. We now see an opportunity for that. We hope
that the meeting to be held in mid-December with the
participation of several ministers can provide an
opportunity to shift gears with regard to Somalia and to
support current efforts at peace resolutely and
effectively. We owe that to the civilian population of
Somalia, which has suffered so much during more than
15 years of war and which is looking to the United
Nations with great hope and confidence.
