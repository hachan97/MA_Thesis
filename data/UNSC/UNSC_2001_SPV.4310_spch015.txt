Mr. Amin (Bangladesh): We also want to join all
others in commending the Special Representative of
the Secretary-General, Mr. Legwaila, and the men and
women of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and
Eritrea (UNMEE) for the sustained progress they have
made in their important work. We also express our
appreciation for the briefing given this morning by
Under-Secretary-General Guehenno.

We also add our voice to those of others who
have expressed concern on the lack of progress in the
establishment of the Temporary Security Zone. But we
note that it has now been achieved, and we commend
the Governments of Eritrea and Ethiopia on that.

The second point on which we also concur with
the concerns expressed by others is the direct route of
flight between the two capitals, whose establishment
has not yet been possible. The discussion on this issue
has been under way for almost three months. We are
concerned that this has not been resolved. We think
that this a matter in which you could play a
constructive role.

We call on the parties to resolve the outstanding
issues related to the Boundary Commission, and hope
that the Commission can start working soon.
