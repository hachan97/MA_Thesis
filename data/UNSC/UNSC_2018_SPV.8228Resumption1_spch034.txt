Mr. Radomski (Poland): Poland voted against the
draft resolution (S/2018/322) presented by Russia. We
believe that the draft resolution submitted originally by
Sweden was an honest attempt to enable the Security
Council to respond promptly to the horrific act of
violence that occurred in eastern Ghouta on Saturday.
To that end, the Security Council needs to re-establish
a professional, truly independent and impartial
accountability mechanism. The draft resolution
proposed by the Russian Federation is missing that
important provision. That is why we had to vote
against it.
