Mr. Wang Xuexian (China) (interpretation from Chinese): This being the first formal meeting of the
Security Council in June, allow me, first of all, warmly to
congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of
the important function of the presidency of the Council.
I am confident that with your wisdom, experience and
outstanding ability you will certainly guide the work of
the Security Council this month to complete success.

I would also like to thank you and the
representatives of other delegations for the kind words
addressed to Ambassador Qin Huasun and to the Chinese
delegation.

The Chinese Government has always supported the
work of the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM) and we are concerned over the incident in
which Iraq denied access to the inspection team. We are
of the view that Iraq must fully implement the relevant
resolutions of the Security Council and must cooperate
fully with UNSCOM. This is in the interest of the Gulf
region and the international community, as well as in the
interest of Iraq itself.

We are also of the view that the reasonable and
legitimate security concerns of Iraq as a sovereign State
should be respected by all parties, that Security Council
resolution 687 (1991) should be implemented
comprehensively and that the sovereignty, territorial
integrity and political independence of Iraq should be
safeguarded.

In view of the above, and given the fact that the
amendments we proposed have already been accepted by
the sponsors, the Chinese delegation will vote in favour
of the draft resolution before the Council.
