Mrs. Ashipala-Musavyi (Namibia): My
delegation, too, would like to acknowledge the
presence of the Special Representative, Mr. Kouchner,
in our midst today and to thank him for his
comprehensive briefing on, among other things, the
elections in Kosovo.

It is indeed reasonable to say that, despite the
non-participation of some ethnic minorities in the
municipal elections, the people of Kosovo have
exercised their right to democratic governance. In
doing so, they have elected their leaders and given
them the mandate to plan for the future of all Kosovars.
In this regard, my delegation commends the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General, the personnel
of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission
in Kosovo (UNMIK) and other members involved in
implementing the mandate of the United Nations
Security Council.

It is also reasonable to assume that it will now be
up to the elected leaders of Kosovo - of course, with
the assistance of the international community - to
start addressing the needs and aspirations of their
communities in the spirit of peaceful coexistence and
in accordance with Security Council resolution 1244
(1999). We believe that full implementation of Security
Council resolution 1244 (1999) is indeed crucial for the
peaceful coexistence of all inhabitants of the Kosovo
province.

Finally, my delegation believes that the municipal
elections are just the beginning of a process of
democratic representation, and in this context,
therefore, we hope that the Special Representative will
continue to engage the elected leaders in a more
meaningful dialogue - a dialogue which will
contribute to much-needed reconciliation.
