Mr. Burleigh (United States of America): We have no
confirmation of the facts at this time. The North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) has opened an investigation
of the matter. If NATO was responsible for this incident we
are deeply sorry. NATO would never target civilians, and
NATO would never target an embassy.

But we in this Council must keep our eye on the big
picture, and the big picture is this: that one man alone is
responsible for this crisis in the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, and his name is Slobodan Milosevic. NATO is
taking action in response to Belgrade's sustained, multi-
year, outrageous, unacceptable policies of ethnic cleansing,
terrorization and repression of its own citizens in Kosovo.
As the world knows, we worked for months and months
and months on a negotiated settlement with Mr. Milosevic.
He never agreed. And as the world also knows, he triggered
a humanitarian catastrophe.

Those are the basic facts and the bottom line. We will
continue to press the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia until
it agrees to accept NATO's conditions and the G-8
principles. That is the only way out of this current situation.

Again, if NATO is responsible for this, we deeply
regret the incident.

I have conveyed my Govemment's regrets and sincere
condolences to Ambassador Qin, and Secretary of State
Albright is conveying the same message to the Chinese
Foreign Minister.
