Mr. Falouh (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): I apologize for taking the floor again. I wish
only to respond to the statement just made by the
representative of Israel. That statement included
misleading claims and distortions of the truth, which
form part of Israel's desperate campaign to deflect the
attention of world public opinion from the activities,
atrocities and holocaust daily carried out by the
terrorist State of Israel in the occupied Palestinian
territories.

Any attentive and wise observer will immediately
see that the Israeli representative's claims and
allegations today are intended to camouflage Israeli
violations of the sovereignty of Lebanon and of
resolution 1701 (2006). The reports of the Secretary-
General on the implementation of resolution 1701
(2006) underscore that Lebanon's Common Border
Force, which comprises the four main relevant
Lebanese Government agencies, has not found any
instance of arms smuggling. That very significant
information is in line with previous statements of
senior Lebanese officials and the findings of the
Lebanon Independent Border Assessment Teams I
and II.

Israel's statements do not alter the fact that Israel
possesses the largest, blackest record of terrorism,
which would need an encyclopaedia, a museum and an
archive to document and shed light on the crimes of
genocide, war crimes and ethnic cleansing carried out
against the Palestinians, the Syrians, the Lebanese, the
Egyptians, the Jordanians and others by Israel
throughout its bloody history.
