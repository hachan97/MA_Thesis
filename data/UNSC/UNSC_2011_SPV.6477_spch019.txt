Baroness Ashton: I will be very brief. I would
just like to thank all members of the Security Council
for their contributions to this debate and for their
encouragement and support of the role of the European
Union.

As I began, I said that I saw this as a critical
partnership and that the European Union would do
everything it could to support the work of the United
Nations. I very much look forward to the post-Lisbon
Treaty building of the European External Action
Service, which will enable us to do that even more
effectively.
