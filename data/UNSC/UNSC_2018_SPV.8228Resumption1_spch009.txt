Mr. Radomski (Poland): The use of chemical
weapons is a serious atrocity, which may amount to a
crime against humanity and a war crime. Accountability
for such acts is a requirement under international
law - and central to achieving sustainable peace in
Syria. Draft resolution S/2018/321, presented by the
United States, addressed the most pressing needs related
to the use of chemical weapons in Syria, including the
role of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons and its Fact-finding Mission, securing
humanitarian access and, last but not least, creating
a new, truly independent and impartial accountability
mechanism. We thank the American delegation for its
ongoing leadership in the negotiations. We appreciate
its flexibility and fully understand and share the
rationale behind putting this text to the vote today.

Because of the use of the veto by the Russian
Federation, the Security Council failed once again
today to establish an accountability mechanism. By
that act, Russia undermined the ability of the Council
to fulfil its primary responsibility under the Charter
of the United Nations: to maintain international peace
and security. We are disappointed that, for some States,
political alliances and calculations proved to be more
important than the need to end the horrors confronting
the civilian population and the unacceptable loss of
human life in Syria.

Poland supports the Independent International
Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, the
Impartial and Independent Mechanism to Assist in the
Investigation and Prosecution of Persons Responsible
for the Most Serious Crimes under International Law
Committed in the Syrian Arab Republic since March
2011, the International Partnership against Impunity for
the Use of Chemical Weapons, and other instruments
that might facilitate bringing the perpetrators of
chemical attacks to justice. We will join all genuine
efforts to achieve that goal.
