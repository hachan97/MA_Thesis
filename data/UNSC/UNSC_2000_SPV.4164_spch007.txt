The President (spoke in French): If no other
member of the Council wishes to speak before the

to vote on the request submitted by Mr. Jovanovic'.

It was so decided.
A vote was taken by a show ofhands.

In favour:
China, Namibia, Russian Federation, Ukraine

Bangladesh, Canada, France, Malaysia,
Netherlands, United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland, United States of America

The President (spoke in French): The result of

the voting is as follows: 4 in favour, 7 against and 4

The request made by Mr. Jovanovie has not been
approved because it failed to obtain the required
number of votes.

I shall now call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements following the voting.
