The President (spoke in Spanish): It is my
understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to
the adoption of the draft annual report.

May I take it that the draft report is adopted by the
Council?

There being no objection, it is so decided.

This decision will be reflected in a note by the
President of the Security Council to be issued as
document S/2015/771.

The meeting rose at10 a.m.
