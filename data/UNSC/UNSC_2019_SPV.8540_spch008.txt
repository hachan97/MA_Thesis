Mr. Djani (Indonesia): Indonesia welcomes
the unanimous adoption of resolution 2473 (2019).
Indonesia calls for the cessation of hostilities in Libya.
We reiterate the call issued by the Security Council
on 10 May for all parties to commit to a ceasefire
and de-escalation and to returning to United Nations
political mediation. We also reiterate that lasting
peace and stability in Libya will come only through a
political solution.

We welcome the efforts made by Special
Representative of the Secretary-General Ghassan
Salame to restore a unified international position on
Libya so as to end its current crisis. The Council has
again and again shown its support for the work of the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General and
the United Nations Support Mission in Libya, and today
Indonesia would like to reaffirm our continued support
for their work. We call on all partners, including
regional organizations, to continue their support and
work in pursuing peace in Libya.

Indonesia calls for the protection of civilians in
Tripoli. We are saddened by the increasing number
of civilian casualties in this crisis. Nevertheless, we
are also concerned for the safety of United Nations
personnel and of the medical and humanitarian workers
on the ground. It is important for all parties to respect
international humanitarian law and human rights, and
not target civilians and humanitarian workers. Efforts
should be made to help those who are in need, and those

efforts should be given a chance to reach them in order military solution is not an option; politieal dialogue is
