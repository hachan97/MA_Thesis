The President: It is my understanding that the
Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft
resolution before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall
now put the draft resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

A vote was taken by show of hands.

Infavonr:
Algeria, Angola, Benin, Brazil, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Pakistan, Philippines,

Romania, Spain, United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of
America

Against:

Russian Federation

The President: The draft resolution received 14
votes in favour, one against and no abstentions. The
draft resolution has not been adopted, owing to the
negative vote of a permanent member of the Council.

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
