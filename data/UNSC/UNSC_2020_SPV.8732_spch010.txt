The President (spoke in French): I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Belgium. Belgium welcomes the adoption of resolution 2511 (2020), renewing the sanctions regime in Yemen. This sanctions regime is one of the tools available to the Security Council to contribute to a solution to the conflict in Yemen and to restore peace, security and stability. We welcome the efforts of the United Kingdom and all the actors around this table to find a compromise on the text. It is important that the Council be united on the issue of Yemen. We had also hoped for a unanimous adoption. Although Belgium agrees with the reference to the recruitment or use of children in armed conflict as a punishable violation of international law, we had hoped that the Council would be able to agree on an independent standard for sanctioning such recruitment or use. The Council has already done so in other United Nations sanctions regimes, in addition to the general designation criteria set forth under international humanitarian and human rights law. Indeed, the Secretary-General's annual report on children and armed conflict (S/2019/509) contains much verified information on why the situation of children in the Yemeni conflict is dire and requires our continued attention. Finally, with regard to the humanitarian exemption on a case-by-case basis in paragraph 3 of the resolution, we support the objective of protecting humanitarian assistance from the unintended consequences of sanctions regimes. However, Belgium favours a general humanitarian exemption tailored to each sanctions regime. The wording of the text in resolution 2511 (2020) therefore does not constitute for us a precedent for other sanctions regimes. I now resume my functions as President of the Council. I give the floor to the representative of Yemen.
