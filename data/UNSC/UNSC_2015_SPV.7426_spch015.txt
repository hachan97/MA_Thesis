Mr. Lucas (Angola): My delegation voted in
favour and fully supports resolution 2216 (2015),
whose necessity was dictated by the Houthis' unilateral
actions that jeopardized what seemed to be a promising
transitional political process in Yemen. It is our hope
that the resolution contributes to a meaningful peace
process in the country and to solving the major
humanitarian crisis there.

We praise Jordan and the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) for their efforts in bringing about the
Security Council's adoption of this resolution for a
political solution based on the GCC's Initiative, which
remains the only framework for the re-engagement of
the political process. We expect that the spoilers are
treated as the resolution disposes.

We are greatly concerned about the growing
number and scale of attacks by Al-Qaida terrorists,
a deadly danger for the future of peace and stability
in the country. We now appeal to all parties to the
conflict to resume negotiations and support United
Nations mediation efforts conducive to reinstating the
transitional political process for a future of stability
and peace in Yemen.
