Mr. Mejdoub (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): We
supported the draft resolution just adopted, which
incorporates a further five-month rollover of the oil-for-
food programme. Our support is in line with Tunisia's
consistent position on the question of Iraq, by which we
have always affirmed the need to adopt a comprehensive
approach taking all aspects of the question into account in a
way that would ensure an improvement in the humanitarian
situation of the Iraqi people and that would effect further
advances leading to an appropriate settlement to the
question.

Open Security Council debates and negotiations
within the Council have shown that the effects of the
sanctions imposed on Iraq are not confined by Iraq's
borders, but extend beyond them to neighbouring
countries and other countries of the region. In that light
we consider that it is important for the Security
Council to adopt a new groundbreaking approach that

would open the way to a consensus solution based on a
comprehensive outlook taking account of the various
problems related to Iraq, and leading to a resolution of
the humanitarian issues facing Iraq and neighbouring
countries.

In supporting the draft resolution we have just
adopted, Tunisia stresses the importance of using the
new rollover period in the humanitarian programme to
intensify our recent discussions with a View to finding
a comprehensive solution to the problem in all its
aspects and dimensions, and to continue our work on
the basis ot'constructive consultation and consensus.
In this context we call for the resumption of a
comprehensive dialogue between the Secretary-General
and Iraq, because we believe that it represents an
important way that we cannot do without, and is
indispensable for advancing our work on the Iraqi
question.
