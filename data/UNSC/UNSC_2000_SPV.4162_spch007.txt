Mr. Cunningham (United States of America):
We also regret that the resolution did not receive
consensus support, but I am pleased to note, as did
Ambassador Greenstock, that the role of the United
Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina
(UNMIBH) and its very important effort does have the
unanimous support of the Council, as well it should.
We also fully support the Peace implementation
Council and its role in the implementation of Dayton.
Indeed, its role is vital and merits Council support, as
contained in this resolution.

My Government feels strongly that the Council
should not weaken its support of the High
Representative or the Peace Implementation
Conference process. We fully supported the decision by
the Peace Implementation Council Steering Board not
to invite the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to its
recent Ministerial meeting in Brussels. In our View, the
Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has
done nothing since it walked out of the December 1998
Madrid Peace Implementation Council Ministerial to
support implementation of the Dayton Accords or to
merit its participation in the Peace Implementation
Council process.
