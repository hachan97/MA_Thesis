Mr. Khalid (Pakistan): Pakistan has voted in
favour of this resolution, as it lifts the United Nations
sanctions against fraternal Libya. The resolution will
also have the effect of dissolving the Libya sanctions
Committee and removing this item from the agenda of
the Security Council. We are glad that, with today's
vote, the sad chapter on Lockerbie and the sanctions
against Libya is coming to a close.

Pakistan unequivocally condemns terrorism. Yet,
the people of Libya have paid a high price with the
sanctions imposed collectively on them. Pakistan has
consistently held that sanctions always have
unintended consequences. The brotherly people of
Libya have faced severe hardship and untold suffering.
We are happy that the longstanding suffering of the
fraternal Libyan people, under the weight of those
sanctions, is now coming to an end.

During negotiations on this resolution, the
Council was faced with the challenge of how to address
the issue of compensation for the victims of the Union
de transports aeriens (UTA) flight. We understand the
French position, given the humanitarian aspects of the
issue. We are glad that an agreement has been reached
between France and the Libyan authorities that has
enabled this resolution to move forward. Nevertheless,
we would like to note that the primary Charter
responsibility of the Security Council is the
maintenance of international peace and security.
Adjudication of issues such as compensation should
appropriately rest with other relevant organs within the
United Nations system, as envisaged in the Charter. If
that approach had been followed, we could have
avoided acrimony, a strain on Council unity and a
delay in the final lifting of the sanctions.
