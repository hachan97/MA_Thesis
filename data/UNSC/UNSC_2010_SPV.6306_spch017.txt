Mr. Moungara Moussotsi (Gabon) (spoke in French): Allow me, Sir, to express to and your
delegation you my delegation's congratulations on your
assumption of the presidency of the Security Council
for the month of May. I assure you of my delegation's
cooperation. I would also like to thank the delegation
of Japan for the able way in which it guided the
Council's work in the month oprril.

Like other delegations before me, I too would
like to thank Baroness Ashton for her briefing. I am
sure that members of the Council will agree with me
that her statement is in line with the strengthened
cooperation between the United Nations and regional
organizations envisaged in Chapter VIII of the Charter.

Such cooperation is needed in the face of
increasing and more complex challenges, particularly
in promoting international peace and security. In that
regard, my delegation duly appreciates the
commendable contribution of the European Union to
restoring peace in the Balkans, as well as in Chad in
the context of the United Nations Mission in the
Central African Republic and Chad.

European Union efforts in Somalia are helping to
strengthen the capacities of Somali forces. Likewise,
the European Union is assisting the African Union
Mission in Somalia in its efforts to restore peace and
stability in that country. In addition, the European
Union is working off the coast of Somalia to combat
piracy in the Gulf of Aden.

We are certain that, with the entry into force of
the Treaty of Lisbon, the role and activities of the
European Union will only be strengthened to create
more dynamic and practical partnerships with the
United Nations. We also hope that the European Union
will strengthen its cooperation with other regional
organizations, including the African Union, so as to
allow them to benefit from its broad and
comprehensive experience in the areas of
peacekeeping, peacebuilding and conflict prevention.
