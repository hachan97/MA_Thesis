Mr. Ciss (Senegal) (spoke in French): In deciding
to vote in favour of the draft resolution (S/2016/1026)
on the humanitarian situation in Syria introduced by
its three co-authors, Egypt, New Zealand and Spain,
the delegation of Senegal wanted to echo the numerous
appeals and warnings made to the Council, including
in this Chamber itself, to act without delay in order
to prevent the city of Aleppo, and its eastern districts
in particular, from becoming an unprecedentedly
terrible tragedy before the helpless gaze of the
international community.

Beyond the issue of Aleppo, what we are really
talking about is breathing new life into the ceasefire
throughout Syria by implementing resolution
2268 (2016) effectively, so as to ensure access for
humanitarian assistance and the evacuation of those
who are injured or vulnerable. We are also talking
about finding the means to combat terrorism more
effectively within the framework of a comprehensive
strategy that respects international humanitarian law
and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.
For all those reasons, my delegation reiterates its call
on the International Syria Support Group, particularly
its two co-Chairs, to make every effort to arrive at an
effective, lasting truce that can give every chance to
a credible political process under the auspices of the
United Nations on the basis of the Geneva communique
of 30 June 2012 and resolution 2254 (2015).

It is by coming together around the goal of peace
and stability in Syria that we will succeed in effectively
combating terrorist organizations such as the Islamic
State and Jabhat Fatah Al-Sham, formerly the Al-Nusra
Front, which are unquestionably our common enemies.
