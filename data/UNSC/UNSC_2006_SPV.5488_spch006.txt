Sir Emyr Jones Parry (United Kingdom): The
United Kingdom is deeply concerned about the crisis in
Gaza, which is undermining prospects for peace in the
Middle East and causing a severe deterioration in the
humanitarian situation of the Palestinian population.
We are contributing nationally to efforts to resolve the
crisis, through contacts in the region and with our key
partners. We are urging all parties to do all they can to
address this crisis and to prevent the situation from
worsening. Only through negotiation can a viable
solution be achieved.

We reiterate our call for the immediate and
unconditional release of Corporal Shalit. We call on the
Palestinian Authority to bring an end to the violence
and terrorist activities, including the firing of rockets
into Israeli territory.

We are very concerned about the suffering of the
Palestinian population. While Israel has every right to
act in self-defence, it should do so in a way that does
not escalate the situation, that is proportionate and
measured and that conforms to international law and
avoids civilian deaths and suffering.

British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett made
a statement today expressing her concern about the
situation in Lebanon.

It is important that any statement from the
Council should support the efforts of those most
closely involved in trying to resolve the conflict. Any
text must therefore be balanced and carefully reflect all
relevant aspects of the situation. While we appreciate
the efforts of the sponsors to reflect some of our
concerns, we still do not believe that the text before us
was sufficiently balanced or that it recognized the
complexity of the situation. We therefore regret that
further time was not allowed to try to resolve the
outstanding differences and to reach a text on which
we could all agree. We therefore abstained in the
voting.
