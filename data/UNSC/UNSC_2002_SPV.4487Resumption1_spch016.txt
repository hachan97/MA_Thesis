Mr. Ibrahim (Somalia): I would like to express
my thanks to the members of the Security Council for
their useful input in today's debate. I also thank the
non-Council members for their statements and their
contributions to the debate.

On the issue of the forthcoming peace and
reconciliation conference in Nairobi, we are of the
opinion that we should not prejudge the outcome in a
negative way. The Somali issue should be viewed in a
holistic manner. The Security Council should take a
unified position of support for the forthcoming
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)
process.

With regard to the security position in Somalia, a
multiple-track approach would, in our opinion, be the
most appropriate track, providing the Transitional
National Government with the necessary resources and
tools, first, to enhance security in Mogadishu and other
areas in Somalia; secondly, to ensure the strict
enforcement of the sanctions regime regarding the
illegal influx of weapons and arms; thirdly, to sustain a
continuous contribution to the campaign against
terrorism; and fourthly, to sustain support for the
IGAD-sponsored peace process and send a very strong
signal to the warlords that their failure to contribute
positively to the peace process will result in punitive
measures against them.

We believe that the Security Council and the
international community must be forward-looking and
start thinking about putting in place a massive
rehabilitation and reconstruction programme for
Somalia.

I want to reiterate that, for our part, the
Transitional National Government will seriously pursue
peace and national reconciliation in Somalia. We
pledge to continue to fully cooperate with the Counter-
Terrorism Committee and bilaterally in combating
terrorism.
