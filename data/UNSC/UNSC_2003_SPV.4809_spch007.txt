Mr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): We
welcome the Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of
Serbia. His trip here is a reminder of the extraordinary
gravity of the act about which the Council is meeting. I
wish to express to him my delegation's condolences.

The murder of the Kosovar children is a horrible,
despicable and almost unimaginable crime. A terrorist
act of this kind - because that is what it is, a
horrendous terrorist act - is completely unjustifiable.
It is totally condemnable, and the international
community must, and does, consider it as such. Its
perpetrators must be brought to justice to answer for
this terrible act. The international community demands
it.

Some years ago, the international community
entered the area to stop what was considered ethnic
cleansing. Today it would be incomprehensible and
totally unjust if it were to remain idle, judging that
what is now at issue are isolated acts that should not be
exaggerated. Those "isolated acts" are links in a policy
of harassment, intimidation and unspeakable violence
against a particular community. Those not-so-isolated
acts can - and in this case do - constitute terrorism.
As we have said, terrorism has no justification or
colour. Terrorism is terrorism.

I hope and wish that the United Nations Interim
Administration in Kosovo will successfully carry out
its inquiries and that those responsible will be brought
to justice. I also trust that the political leaders will be
able to maintain calm and will sincerely seek to
achieve the objectives of resolution 1284 (1999): a
tolerant multi-ethnic community in which dialogue and
democracy are the rule, not the exception.
