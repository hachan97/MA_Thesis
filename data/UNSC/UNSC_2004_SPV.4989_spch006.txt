Mr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): My
delegation voted in favour of the draft resolution on the
question of Cyprus because it is a response to the
request made by the Government of Cyprus that the
United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) be
maintained on the island beyond 15 June 2004.

My delegation would have preferred that, as was
agreed beforehand, the draft resolution be a purely
technical text. Clearly, that is not quite the case, as has
just been noted by my colleague from Pakistan.

My delegation hopes that the Security Council
will consider the report of the Secretary-General on his
mission of good offices, including the
recommendations contained therein.
