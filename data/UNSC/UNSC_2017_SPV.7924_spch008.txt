Mr. Lambertini (Italy) (spoke in French): Italy
welcomes the adoption by the Security Council of
resolution 2350 (2017), which marks a critical turning
point, moving the focus ofUnited Nations peacekeeping
in Haiti from stabilization to institution-building. The
unanimity of the Council will ensure that the United
Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti and the United
Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti will hold
firm in the implementation of their mandates. It also
demonstrates the consensus within the Security Council
on the Haitian question, which is very important at
this stage.

My country reaffirms its support for a responsible
transition, as set out in the resolution just adopted. We
are committed to continue to help Haiti on their path
toward a stable and inclusive democracy and lasting
peace. With this resolution, the Council establishes
a road map that will ensure that the United Nations
assistance is appropriate to the current circumstances
in Haiti. This is an important stage in the peacekeeping
mandate, which will be tailored to the real needs of
the country.

Italy welcomes, in particular, the importance
attached to human rights, the participation of women
and the principle of responsibility, to which we attribute
a key role in the ability of Haitian authorities to achieve
their objectives, as well as to ensure the credibility of
United Nations missions.
