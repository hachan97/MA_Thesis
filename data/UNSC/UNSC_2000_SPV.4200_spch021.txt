The President (spoke in French): I thank the
representative of Namibia for his kind words addressed
to me.

I shall now make a statement in my capacity as
representative of Mali.

In view of the fact that most of the concerns of
my delegation have already been expressed by previous
speakers, I shall simply make three brief comments.

First, I should like to associate the delegation of
Mali with the tribute that was paid to Mr. Bernard
Kouchner, the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General, and to all the teams he has set up. His briefmg
today made it possible for us to accurately assess the
important progress made in the civilian administration
in Kosovo. But it seems that at the same time, the
progress has been hampered by continued acts of ethnic
violence. We consider that the accomplishments cannot
be maintained if there is an atmosphere of violence and
fear, so we think that equal importance must continue
to be given to promoting reconciliation and tolerance.

Secondly, I turn to the matter of elections. We
give our full support to the electoral process,
particularly the local elections that will be held in
October. They are an important contribution to building
a multi-ethnic society. So that the people of Kosovo
can invest themselves in this process, it seems
important, in fact necessary, to ensure that all ethnic
groups participate in the process.

Thirdly, let me say that we concur with Malaysia
and Jamaica in particular with regard to civil
registration, disappeared persons and detainees.

Finally, let me repeat to Mr. Kouchner how very
much my delegation supports his many initiatives in
implementing resolution 1244 (1999).

I now resume my function as President of the
Council. I give the floor to Mr. Kouchner to respond to
comments and questions.
