The President: The next two speakers will be the
representatives of the United Kingdom and France, at the
ministerial level. As I said earlier, the United States will
forgo its national statement, and we will then have
completed the ministerial statements at this meeting. I
will call on the permanent representatives who wish to
take the floor. Because of the tremendous time limits, the
very large number of representatives who wish to speak
and the absolute need, because of the pressing obligations
of all the heads of Government here, to suspend the
meeting today at 5 pm. or, perhaps, a few minutes
afterwards, I urge everyone to speak very briefly.

It is now my great pleasure to welcome back to the
Council one of the two men - the other is Sir Jeremy
Greenstock - who presided over the Council last month
in our seminal discussions of African issues during the
presidency of the United Kingdom: the Minster of State
for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United
Kingdom, Mr. Peter Hain.
