Mr. Zagaynov (Russia) (spoke in Russian): 1
would like to respond very briefly to the delegation
of Ukraine. This is a serious event. We are discussing
the fight against terrorism - real terrorism, not that
of which he is attempting to accuse the inhabitants of
the eastern part of his country. I call on him to join
this very important work, rather than continuing to
speculate on this topic and the human tragedies that
have taken place.
