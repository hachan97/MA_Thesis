Mr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): Ukraine voted against
the draft resolution initially proposed by the Russian
Federation (S/2017/968) for several reasons.

First, we view the document as a deliberate attempt
to undermine the credibility and independence of
both the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism
(JIM) and the Fact-finding Mission in the Syrian Arab
Republic (FFM).

Secondly, it appears from the text that the goal of
the draft is to create artificial and unwarranted obstacles
to independent investigations. Moreover, the attempt to
micromanage the JIM. and the FFM. is nothing less than
an ill-disguised effort to sabotage the work of both the
Mission and the Mechanism.

Thirdly, it is also noteworthy that the document
was not open for negotiation within the Council. That
speaks volumes about the willingness of its authors
to actually reach agreement on it and, by the way, to
contribute to the draft resolution proposed by the
United States (S/2017/962), which was the product of
real negotiations.

All in all, we cannot support a scenario the sole aim
of which is to protect at any price the perpetrators of
atrocious crimes in Syria from accountability.
