Mr. Gatilov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Rassian): The Russian Federation was one of the
initiators of the resolution adopted today by the
Security Council. In that regard, we believe that the
problem of the acquisition of weapons of mass
destruction by non-State actors, primarily for terrorist
purposes, is becoming one of the crucial threats to
international peace and security.

The resolution just adopted is targeted
specifically at that threat. It seeks to ensure the
coordination of action to counter the black market in
weapons of mass destruction and related technologies
and materials. It does not supercede existing non-
proliferation mechanisms, but establishes an
operational framework for international cooperation in
this field; nor does it impede scientific and technical
cooperation for peaceful purposes.

The resolution contains a set of practical
measures at the national level to ensure reliable
barriers to access by terrorists to weapons of mass
destruction and their components. It is important that,
in seeking to implement the resolution, the Committee
established by the Security Council ensure ongoing
Council oversight of efforts to prevent the illicit
acquisition of weapons of mass destruction.

We appreciate the consensus that has been
reached, reflecting the international community's
growing understanding of the need to undertake
collective efforts against the proliferation threat, in
strict compliance with the standards of international
law. We believe that the resolution will be fully
implemented by all States.
