Ms. Sison (United States ofAmerica): As Secretary
Kerry quoted earlier in this session, Senator Daniel
Patrick Moynahan had said my colleagues are entitled
to their own opinions but not to their own facts. Let
us just keep in mind the facts of who is prolonging
the suffering of the Syrian people. The last speaker's
statement was so full of untruths that I feel no need to
say anything further.
