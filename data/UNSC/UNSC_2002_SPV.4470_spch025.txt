The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like
to thank the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees, Mr. Ruud Lubbers, for his participation in
this meeting. This has been time very well spent. It
could have been extended so that we could continue
hearing the explanations and perspectives of the High
Commissioner concerning the problem of refugees. I
also thank him for his gracious words addressed to me
and to my country.

No other member of the Security Council has
asked for the floor.

Before adjourning the meeting, I wish to
announce that it is my understanding that the members
of the Council have reached agreement on a
presidential statement on the situation in Burundi.
Accordingly, immediately following the adjournment
of this meeting, I shall convene another meeting of the
Council to adopt that statement.

The meeting rose at 1.25 pm.
