Mr. Sajdik: Like Ambassador Apakan, I would
like to express my gratitude for having been invited to
brief the Security Council on the situation in eastern
Ukraine.

I understand that there are high expectations, as
well as a certain impatience with the state of affairs.
There are high expectations in terms of scaling up
the work of the Trilateral Contact Group and the four
working groups. I will certainly pass on that message
of the expectations and the feeling of impatience at the
next meeting of the Trilateral Contact Group, which
will take place tomorrow in Minsk.

As Ambassador Apakan said, we very much hope
that at tomorrow's meeting we will be able to again
establish a ceasefire on the occasion of the Orthodox
Easter holiday, which falls on this weekend. The
ceasefire should not be limited to that holiday, but
endure, restoring the hope of the civilian population in
the areas of eastern Ukraine that they will see a brighter
future. I can only reiterate that I will do everything in
my power to fully implement the 12 February 2015
Minsk agreement, and to ensure that the agreement
works better than it has thus far.
