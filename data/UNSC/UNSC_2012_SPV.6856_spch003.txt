The President: It is my understanding that the
Council is ready to proceed to the adoption of the draft
annual report.

May I take it that the draft report is adopted by the
Council?

There being no objection, it is so decided.

This decision will be reflected in a note by the
President of the Security Council to be issued as
document S/2012/815.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 10.20 am.
