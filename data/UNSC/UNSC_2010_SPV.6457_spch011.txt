The President: On behalf of the Security Council,
I take this opportunity to express appreciation to the
outgoing Chairmen for the manner in which they have
discharged their important responsibilities on behalf of
the Council. Ambassador Mayr-Harting, Ambassador
Nishida, Ambassador Heller, Ambassador Apakan and
Ambassador Rugunda, we are grateful for your
leadership on those issues.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my list.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

Before adjourning, I would like to invite Council
members to consultations upon the adjournment of this
meeting.
