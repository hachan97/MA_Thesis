Mr. Qin Huasun (China) (interpretation from Chinese): The Chinese delegation is deeply concerned and
disturbed by the recent aggravation of the conflict in
Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially the further
deterioration of the situation in the safe area of
Srebrenica, the detention of United Nations Protection
Force (UNPROFOR) personnel, the worsening of the
humanitarian situation and the increase in the number of
refugees. We strongly urge the parties concerned to enter
into an immediate cease-fire and to stop all hostilities in
Srebrenica, so as to avoid a further escalation of conflict.

The resolution that the Council has just adopted is
aimed at protecting the safe area of Srebrenica and the
lives and security of the civilians in the area, stopping
offensives against UNPROFOR and preventing the further
worsening of the humanitarian situation there. The
Chinese delegation has therefore voted in favour of it.

However, we have reservations about taking
enforcement action by invoking Chapter VII of the
Charter, as set forth in the resolution, and we are also
concerned and disturbed at the serious political and
military consequences that might arise from the actions
authorized in the resolution, in particular, the possibility
that the peace-keeping force could thus become a party to
the conflict and lose the basis of its continued existence
as a result.

Here, I wish to reiterate that the Chinese delegation
has all along held that only peaceful negotiation and
consultation on a fair and reasonable basis can lead to a
lasting solution acceptable to all to the question of the
former Yugoslavia, including that of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. We once again urge the parties to the
conflict to cooperate with the international community
and UNPROFOR and settle their dispute by peaceful
means.

We also hope that the international community will
step up its diplomatic and political efforts to create a
favourable environment for peaceful negotiations in the
region of the former Yugoslavia and will continue to
advance the process of a comprehensive political
settlement of the question of the former Yugoslavia and
that it will not take any action that might exacerbate
tensions there.
