Mr. Ikouebe (Congo) (spoke in French): I
welcome the Security Council's adoption today of this
resolution, which supports the efforts under way for
quite some time now by the African Union and the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)
to bring peace back to Somalia. For years now, that
country has felt abandoned by the international
community. Last week again, in Abuja, the Prime
Minister of Somalia asked his peers, the African
leaders, to do everything in their power to ensure that
the Council would adopt the draft resolution being
negotiated at that time in New York.

I welcome the fact that the Council has adopted
this text unanimously. In particular, I am thankful to
the delegation of the United States of America, which
joined the three African countries members of the
Council in sponsoring the text, so important for Africa.

With the adoption of this text, IGAD will be in a
position to deploy a training and protection force,
whose purpose has been and remains to restore peace
in Somalia, to assist in the dialogue among all parties
and to support commitments already undertaken,
particularly in the Khartoum talks. As everyone knows,
the African Union recognizes the transitional federal
institutions, but it encourages dialogue between those
institutions and the Union of Islamic Courts.

Finally, we invite all States, in particular
neighbouring countries, to strictly respect this

resolution. In this regard, respect for the arms embargo
constitutes significant proof of their commitment to the
restoration of peace in Somalia.
