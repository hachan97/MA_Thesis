Mr. Li Yongsheng (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
thanks President Maron and Prosecutor Brammertz for
their briefings on the work of the International Residual
Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals.

China knows that during the reporting period, the
Mechanism continued to make progress in its traditional
activities. An appeal judgements has been rendered on
the Seselj case. The Stanisic' and Simatovie case, the
Karadeie case and the Mladie case continue to move
forward. Eight convicted persons have been transferred
to Senegal and Benin to serve their sentences. In that
regard, China knows that President Meron is committed
to completing the Karadeic case by the end of the year.

China welcomes the efforts and progress made by
the Office of the Prosecutor in tracking fugitives of
the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. China
hopes that, in line with the requirement of the Security
Council to be small, temporary and efficient, the
Mechanism will continue to take measures to efficiently
push forward case trials and other work. China
commends the Office of Internal Oversight Services
for its evaluation report on the working methods of
the Mechanism. It is our hope that the Mechanism will
implement the recommendations in the report. China
consistently supports the international rule of law and
the work of the Mechanism.

In conclusion, I would like to take this opportunity
to thank Peru in its capacity as Chair of the Informal
Working Group on International Tribunals and the
Office of Legal Affairs for their work.
