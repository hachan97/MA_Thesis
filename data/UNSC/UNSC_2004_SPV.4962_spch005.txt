Mr. Holliday (United States of America): Once
again, Sir, I would like to offer you congratulations on
your assumption of the presidency of the Security
Council. I would also like to thank Assistant Secretary-
General Turk for his briefing on the status of the
political process and weapons disposal in Bougainville
and on the work of the United Nations Observer
Mission in Bougainville (UNOMB).

We also appreciate the opportunity to hear the
views of neighbouring States that work to promote
stabilization and continue to provide development
assistance in Bougainville. We would again like to
express our gratitude to former Head of Mission Noel
Sinclair, and we would like to thank the current Head
of Mission, Tor Stenbock, for his continued efforts to
facilitate the constitutional process and weapons
disposal.

We appreciate the efforts of regional players in
assisting development in Bougainville, in particular
Australia's commitment to provide considerable
financial assistance through the newly established
governance and implementation fund.

The United Nations Observer Mission in
Bougainville (UNOMB) has achieved considerable
progress since Assistant Secretary-General Tiirk last
reported to the Council in December 2003. We are
encouraged to hear that the United Nations Mission has
now overseen the disposal of 83 per cent of the
contained weapons in Bougainville. We hope that
weapons destruction will be completed in the near
future. We are also encouraged to learn that the Papua
New Guinea Government and Bougainville leaders are
working on the third and final draft of the Bougainville
constitution. Both parties should work to complete the
constitutional process as soon as possible. It is critical
that Bougainvilleans have the opportunity to decide on
an autonomous government, and therefore that the
parties involved set a date for elections.
