Ms. Sison (United States of America): Yesterday,
we learned from our Russian colleagues about a
proposed arrangement that Russia and Turkey had
concluded to introduce a cessation of hostilities and
restart intra-Syrian discussions. Their goals are
laudable and we welcome all efforts to end the violence
in Syria and strongly support a nationwide ceasefire
accompanied by unfettered humanitarian access to all
besieged areas.

That having been said, we are still learning more
about this initiative, including details regarding its
implementation. In this regard, we regret that the
annexes to the agreements, which outline the ceasefire
arrangement brokered by Russia and Turkey in detail,
have not yet been made available.

We voted in favour of resolution 2336 (2016)
because it strikes the right balance between cautious
optimism and support, predicated on hope but tempered
by a realistic need to wait to see how this arrangement
is implemented before casting the full weight of the
Security Council behind it. We would highlight two
key points.

Our hope is that a ceasefire will truly hold and will
not serve as a justification for further unacceptable
offensives. In that regard, we are concerned at reports
of a regime offensive, supported by Hizbullah militia,
in Wadi Barada. The Security Council's adoption of
this text should be seen as a strong signal that such
activities must cease.

We have also seen press reports that some
signatories are concerned about differences between
regime and opposition versions ofdelegation documents.
In that regard, we hope that the reconciliation of
any differences - or an explanation of why there
are differences - will occur swiftly. We especially
stress that paragraph 2 of the resolution just adopted
emphasizes the need for the full implementation of
resolutions 2254 (2015) and 2268 (2016). Likewise, it is
clear from paragraph 3 that talks in Astana will relate
directly to the United Nations process.
