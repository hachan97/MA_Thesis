Mr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China opposes and condemns the assassination of
Sheikh Yassin by Israel. The practice of targeted
removal by Israel violates international law and is
therefore unacceptable. We are in favour of a prompt
and appropriate response by the Security Council, and
in principle we agree with the draft presidential
statement proposed by Algeria on behalf of the Arab
States. We regret the Security Council's failure to reach
consensus on that draft statement.

We have always held the View that the Middle
East issue is extremely complex. Meeting violence with
violence will not help matters. On the contrary, it can
lead only to more violence and conflict and result in
the further deterioration of the situation.

We are deeply worried about the potential impact
that the assassination of Sheikh Yassin may have on the
regional situation and on the Middle East peace
process. China calls upon the various parties to
exercise restraint under current circumstances, and to
refrain from taking any actions that might further
escalate the tension. At this critical juncture, the
international community must work even harder and
take effective measures to stabilize the situation and
urge the Israeli and Palestinian sides to resume their
peace talks as early as possible. The only effective way
to achieve peace between Israel and Palestine is to seek
a comprehensive solution through negotiation, based
on relevant Security Council resolutions.
