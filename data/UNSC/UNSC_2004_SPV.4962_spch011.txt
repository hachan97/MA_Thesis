Mr. Duclos (France) (spoke in French): First, I
thank the German delegation for its excellent work last
month as President of the Council. I convey to you, Sir,
our congratulations and best wishes for the Pakistani
presidency this month. I also wish to thank Mr. Danilo
Turk for his clear and comprehensive briefing.

What struck us in that account is the fact that
things are now moving in the right direction. The
establishment of autonomous institutions has been
speeded up, the collection of weapons is to be
completed soon and the Constitution should soon be
adopted. That will be a decisive stage with respect to
the elections, which could be held before the end of the
yean

Admittedly, there are still concerns. I am thinking
in particular of the security situation, which is still
precarious. I would recall that the Bougainville police
forces are still rather small and have not yet received
sufficient training to cope with the situation. But it is
undeniable that the overall development of the
situation in Bougainville is satisfactory.

The question facing us today is, what will happen
to the United Nations Observer Mission in
Bougainville after 30 June? It seems to us that it is still
a little early to take a decision in that respect. We await
with interest the report of the Secretariat fact-finding
team that will visit in June. However, we believe that
the international community should continue its efforts
in three areas: first, support for the transition in
Bougainville; secondly, preparations for elections; and
thirdly, assistance for development.

I cannot conclude this brief statement without
commending the work done by Ambassador Noel
Sinclair in heading the United Nations Observer
Mission in Bougainville and that of his successor,
Mr. Stenbock.
