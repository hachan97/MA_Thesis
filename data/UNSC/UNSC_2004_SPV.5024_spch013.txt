Mr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
First, I thank the Secretary-General for his report on
the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor
(UNMISET) (S/2004/669). I also thank Assistant
Secretary-General Annabi for his briefing.
In the past several months, with the unflagging
efforts of the Timorese Government and people, Timor-
Leste has witnessed remarkable progress in all areas of
nation-building. The Timorese Government has
continued to enhance its public administration
capabilities. Its legal framework and law enforcement
agencies have improved. The police and the armed
forces have been strengthened and have successfully
assumed responsibility for maintaining national
security. We congratulate the Timorese people on their
achievements in nation-building.

As the report of the Secretary-General notes,
Timor-Leste still faces many challenges in maintaining
national stability, improving public administration and
promoting economic and social development.
UNMISET still has much work to do during its
mandate; in order fully to achieve prosperity and
stability, the Timorese people still have much to do as
well. During this period, the international community
must establish a long-term partnership with Timor-
Leste. We highly appreciate UNMISET's positive role
in Timor-Leste's development and construction. We
support UNMISET as it continues to provide support
for Timor-Leste's early self-sufficiency. At the same
time, we call upon the international community,
including the United Nations Development Programme,
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to
continue to support and assist Timor-Leste in its
nation-building in order to ensure sustainable
development in all areas.
