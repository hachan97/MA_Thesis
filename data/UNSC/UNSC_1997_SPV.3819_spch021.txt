The President: I wonder if I might at this moment
express condolences, on behalf of the whole Council, to
the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, whose wife died last
night. He has returned home. On behalf of us all, I
express our condolences to Mr. Alhaj Abdus Samad
Azad.

I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and
International Co-operation of Kenya, His Excellency The
Honourable Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka.
