Mr. Burleigh (United States of America): The United
States will vote in favour of this draft resolution because of
our deep concern about the fate of the crews and
passengers of the two United Nations aircraft that were
recently downed over Angola. We urgently call on the
Government of Angola and UNITA to cooperate fully with
the search-and-rescue mission and with the investigation of
these tragic incidents.

We do have concerns about two aspects of this draft
resolution. We question the appropriateness of the
reference to Chapter VII, since the draft resolution does
not seek to authorize new international enforcement
action. We are concerned that such a reference might be
misunderstood as a step in that direction.

Secondly, we doubt the wisdom of considering the
imposition of sanctions against communications with
UNITA. The past three weeks have demonstrated the
crucial importance of being able to communicate quickly
with UNITA on search-and-rescue operations and other
humanitarian concerns.

We believe that the only way to resolve this ongoing
conflict is through negotiations and not through military
action. A negotiated settlement cannot be achieved
without the ability to communicate with all parties. In this
context, the report requested by this draft resolution must
address how such communications can be maintained with
all parties.
