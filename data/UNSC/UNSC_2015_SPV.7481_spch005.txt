The President: I thank Mr. Al Hussein for his
briefing.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2015/508, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by Jordan, Lithuania, Malaysia,
New Zealand, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and the United States of America.

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the voting.
