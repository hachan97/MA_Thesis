Mr. Qin Huasun (China) (interpretation from Chinese): The oil-for-food programme is a temporary
measure aimed at mitigating the humanitarian situation in
Iraq which cannot substitute for or be used as a means to
delay the lifting of sanctions against Iraq.
I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate that, with
the progress made in weapons verification in Iraq, the
Security Council should make objective assessments,
close the various weapons files as soon as possible and
lift the sanctions against Iraq.

In accordance with the humanitarian needs of Iraq,
Security Council resolution 1153 (1998) increased the
amount of humanitarian supplies Iraq could import. In
order to enable Iraq to reach the corresponding level of
oil-exporting capability, the Secretary-General has
recommended that Iraq be allowed to import $300 million
worth of equipment and spare parts for oil production.

We believe that a settlement of the question of the
Iraqi import of equipment and spare parts for oil
production needs only a simple and technical resolution.
It is not necessary to involve irrelevant questions.
Therefore, we believe that certain elements contained in
the draft resolution before us are not necessary. However,
considering the needs of Iraq, and in order to enable Iraq
to import equipment and spare parts for oil production as
soon as possible and improve its oil-producing capability,
China will vote in favour of the draft resolution before us.

We hope that Iraq will be able to import equipment
and spare parts for oil production as soon as possible.
