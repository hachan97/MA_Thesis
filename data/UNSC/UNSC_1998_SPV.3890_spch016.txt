The Secretary-General: The nuclear tests in India
and Pakistan are unquestionably disturbing developments
with far-reaching consequences for the region and for the
international community. They affect the peace and
stability of South Asia, a region that has been one of the

 

cradles of human civilization, a region with great potential
for economic and social development. They also impact
seriously on the ongoing process of nuclear non-
proliferation and nuclear disarmament and its future, and on
our common security.

It is significant that the Security Council, which under
the Charter has primary responsibility for the maintenance
of international peace and security, should speak with one
voice and without delay on these developments. I thank the
sponsors for their initiative and for their hard work to
achieve a resolution which addresses the concerns of all
members of the Council.

I would like in particular to welcome the call to India
and Pakistan to resume their bilateral talks on the issues
that have sadly divided them. I will continue my own
efforts to encourage this dialogue, in the hope that it will
reduce tensions and the danger of an escalation into a
nuclear arms race.

Over the past several years there have been
encouraging signs that the world might be moving towards
ending the global nuclear arms race as the process of
nuclear disarmament continued to be implemented in terms
of article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons. Developments that contradict or impede
this process must certainly be avoided as we move together
towards the ultimate goal of eliminating nuclear weapons in
a safer and better world for us all and for future
generations.
