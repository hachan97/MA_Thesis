Mr. Dejammet (France) (spoke in French): The draft
resolution before the Council relates to the renewal of
resolution 986 (1995), commonly known as the
oil-for-food resolution. After 1997 that resolution was
regularly renewed by the Council for six-month periods,
until a recent decision to extend its provisions for 15
days, which proved impracticable.

The text before us would extend the provisions of
the resolution for seven days. Such a short seven-day
extension would make it technically impossible to sell oil
and, therefore, fully to implement resolution 986 (1995).
The minimum time required for processing contracts
under the mechanism set up by the United Nations means
that oil sales will not be able to take place. The draft
resolution therefore seems to be drafted in such a way as
to deliberately render incapable of realization the measure
that it proposes.

It is true that we have been told that the issue is not
about adopting a humanitarian text, but about using this
vote for another purpose: to bring pressure to bear on the
members of the Security Council with regard to another
exercise and another resolution. The expected vote
therefore has nothing to do with its theoretical purpose.

Is it conceivable that in the Security Council we
should take a decision on a text that we know cannot be
implemented in practice? Is it conceivable that we should
take a decision on a text which owes its existence to
considerations that are alien to its purpose? We do not
believe so. That is why, given this exceptional and
extremely unusual process, we see only one reasonable
position to take: not to participate in the voting.
