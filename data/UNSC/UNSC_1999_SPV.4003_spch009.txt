Mr. Andjaba (Namibia): A crisis is unfolding in
Kosovo, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. What was
hoped would be a limited crisis has continued to escalate
to frightening proportions. Persecutions, loss of life,
destruction of infrastructure and property, as well as
environmental damage with possible effect well beyond
the borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
continue. As a result of ethnic cleansing, as well as of the
military action of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), many refugees are finding themselves in
neighbouring countries, as well as in other parts of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, far away from their

 

homes, living under deplorable conditions. Similarly, the
ongoing military action has severely affected the lives of
the people in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

It is in view of the aforementioned that Namibia has
joined in cosponsoring the draft resolution under
consideration. We wish to emphasize that the human
tragedy, which continues to escalate, is such that a political
solution has become even more imperative.

My delegation wishes to underscore that the
humanitarian situation in and around Kosovo is not a
natural phenomenon. It cannot be addressed in isolation
from the political context. We wish to reiterate our position
in calling for a cessation of hostilities. Only then can we
meaningfully address the humanitarian situation. In this
connection, we reiterate that the Security Council should
reassert its authority over the situation that is now unfolding
in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a whole.
