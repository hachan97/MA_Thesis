Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We are grateful to the members of the Council
for the unanimous adoption of the Russian Federation's
draft resolution in support of the arrangements to settle
the Ukrainian crisis reached in Minsk on 12 February.

The events that have taken place during the
yearlong conflict in the territory of that country have
been truly tragic. Thousands of people have died and
many towns and villages in eastern Ukraine have been
nearly destroyed. More than a million civilians have
left the conflict zone, the vast majority of whom have
sought shelter on Russian territory.
We believe that now, following the unprecedented
diplomatic efforts undertaken in Minsk on 12 February
by the highest authorities of Russia, France, Germany
and Ukraine, there is a genuine opportunity for Ukraine
to turn this tragic page in its history. We support
the high assessment of the adoption on 12 February
of the package of measures for the implementation
of the Minsk agreements and the declaration of the
four leaders. We are fully prepared to facilitate the
implementation of those agreements.

All sides must fully comply with the Minsk
agreements. We must avoid the adoption of unilateral
measures that would clearly contravene the letter
and the spirit of the documents adopted in Minsk on
12 February.

Since the very start of the crisis, Russia has actively
called for its peaceful settlement through inclusive and
transparent dialogue between the sides in the internal
Ukrainian conflict and has done its utmost to ensure
that an open dialogue is established on fundamental
political and constitutional issues. We will adhere to
this principled approach in future also.
