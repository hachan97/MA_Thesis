The President (spoke in Spanish): I would like to
thank Grace Akallo for her presence here today and her
courage in coming to share her painful experience with
us. I also wish to congratulate her for her strength and
her will to move forward. I have no doubt that
Ms. Akallo's testimony should demonstrate to us the
urgency with which the international community
should continue to act on this issue. Thank you very
much, Grace. We all wish you the very best in the
future.
In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers
to limit their statements to no more than five minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing and to
deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.
