Mr. Gatilov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation expresses its regret
that the Security Council was unable to respond to the
development of events in the Palestinian territories
resulting from the killing of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin,
spiritual leader of the Islamic movement Hamas.
Yesterday, the United Nations Commission on Human
Rights, as the outcome of a special meeting, adopted by
majority vote a resolution on the dangerous situation in
the occupied Palestinian territories that condemned
such actions by Israel and contained an appeal to the
Israeli Government to comply with the principles of
international humanitarian law and to refrain from any
and all forms of human rights violations in the
occupied Palestinian territories.

The Russian Federation's position remains
unchanged. We believe that the phenomenon of
extremism must be eradicated. We condemn terrorism
in all its forms and manifestations, as they violate the
most fundamental right of human beings: the right to
life. In the Security Council, we have consistently
voted in favour of resolutions condemning terrorist
acts, including those aimed at Israel's civilian
population. We voted in favour of this draft resolution
because, inter alia, it contains a condemnation of all
terrorist attacks against civilians. From the very outset,
we favoured the drafting of a consensus approach that
would have ensured Council unity on this issue. We
believe that there were opportunities to achieve such a
consensus and that the consultations should have been
continued.

Once again, the Russian Federation calls upon the
Israeli and Palestinian sides to demonstrate restraint
and a high level of responsibility and to reject
unilateralism. Of particular importance in the current
situation are internationally coordinated efforts, under
the aegis of the Quartet of mediators, to bring the road
map to the level of practical implementation.
