The President (spoke in Chinese): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of China.

First of all, China condemns the terrorist attack
that occurred last Friday. We express our condolences
and sympathy over the deaths and casualties resulting
from the attack.

This morning, the Security Council unanimously
adopted resolution 2444 (2018), lifting the sanctions
on Eritrea and extending the mandate of the Panel
of Experts of the Committee established pursuant
to resolution 751 (1992). In the past few months, we
have witnessed positive changes in the situation in
the Horn of Africa and a continued improvement
of relations among the countries of the region. The
Council's lifting of sanctions on Eritrea is conducive
to the efforts of the countries of the region to achieve
peace and development and to maintain the current
positive development momentum in the region, which
China welcomes.

Meanwhile, the Horn ofAfrica still faces challenges.
The Council and, indeed, the international community
should continue to provide constructive assistance in
the light of the needs of the countries in the region.
We hope that the countries concerned in the region
will actively take the current favourable opportunity
to increase dialogue and consultations and meet each
other halfway to properly solve the issues. I hope that
the international community will continue to help the
Somali Government focus on the threat of Al-Shabaab
and make progress in Somalia's national reconciliation
process. China is ready to continue to work with the
international community in playing a constructive role
in the attainment of peace, stability and development in
the countries of the Horn of Africa.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Somalia.
