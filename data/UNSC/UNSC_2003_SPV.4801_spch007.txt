Mr. Negroponte (United States of America): The
resolution we have adopted today responds to the
Secretary-General's recommendations on the way
ahead in the Western Sahara. This resolution represents
a considered recommendation of the Council to the
parties and neighbouring States but does not constitute
an imposition. All Council members support the peace
plan for the self-determination of the people of Western
Sahara as an optimum political solution to this long-
standing dispute of nearly 30 years.

The peace plan is a fair and balanced compromise
giving each party some, but not all, of what it wants.
We call on the parties and the neighbouring States to
seize the opportunity presented by the plan and to
cooperate closely and actively with the Secretary-
General and his Personal Envoy, and with each other,
to follow up this important resolution. We especially
appreciate the efforts of the Secretary-General's
Personal Envoy, Mr. James Baker, in achieving this
important step forward towards resolution of the long-
standing Western Sahara dispute.
