Mr. Traore (Guinea) (spoke in French): On
behalf of my delegation, Sir, I too would like to
congratulate you on the national day of the Russian
Federation.

A year has passed since the Council unanimously
adopted resolution 1422 (2002) thanks to a
compromise, which took into account the concerns
expressed by some Member States on the one hand,
and respect for the Statute of the International Criminal
Court, on the other. My country, which is a signatory to
the Rome Statute, reaffirms the principle of
universality and the primacy of the Court, whose
establishment will help us build a world based on the
rule of law.

We must recognize that the Rome Statute offers
safeguards that enable States to enjoy some exceptions
if need be. In that regard, we do not see any basic or
insurmountable contradiction at this time. Therefore,
my delegation, which perfectly understands the
concerns expressed by some, maintains the hope that in
the near future the consensus for which everyone
wishes will emerge after our consideration of the issue,
not only for the implementation but also for the
strengthening and greater effectiveness of
peacekeeping operations. My country's support for
renewing resolution 1422 (2002) is part of that View
and should in no way be considered automatic renewal
year after year.
