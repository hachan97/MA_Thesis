Mr. Teixeira da Silva (France) (spoke in French): I, too, would like to thank Mr. Guehenno for
his statement, which contained some good news.

I shall confine myself to putting a question to
him, echoing what Ambassador Kuchinsky has just
said about the work of the Boundary Commission. In
paragraph 6 of resolution 1344 (2001), which we
adopted a month ago, the Secretariat was asked to
provide more detailed information about the financing
of the work of the Commission. We would like to know
when that information will be available and whether
the Assistant Secretary-General would, as of today, be
in a position to provide further details about the
funding of the work of the Commission. We recognize
the importance of the Commission, and would like to
know about the commitment of the parties themselves,
the payments made to the Trust Fund and the nature
and degree of the support that the United Nations
Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea can contribute to the
work of the Commission.
