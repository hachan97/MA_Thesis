Mr. Abarry (Niger) (spoke in French): If we had been forced to make the decision this morning, we would certainly have missed the opportunity to show the people of Yemen that we stood by them at this difficult time in their history. The abstention of two important members of the Council could have - and should have - been avoided because the ideal would have been to have a consensus adoption of resolution 2511 (2020). I would like to commend the wisdom of the President in opening with consultations, the result of which is reflected in the vote on resolution 2511 (2020). Whatever one may say, the postponement of a few short hours has enabled the Council to transcend itself and focus on what matters most - moving forward together to find solutions for those in need. The violence and serious human rights violations in Yemen must stop without further delay. May Belgium, a country of consensus, continue to use its presidency to inspire our work and our reflections in future.
