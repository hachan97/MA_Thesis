Mr. Listre (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish):
Argentina's abstention is based on my delegation's
serious doubts regarding the underlying reasons for
denying participation in this debate to Mr. Jovanovic',
particularly bearing in mind previous instances in the
Council in recent months especially during the month
of December.

I wish to fully clarify that this vote in no way
implies support for, endorsement of or sympathy for
the Belgrade regime, in respect of which my delegation
agrees with everything, or nearly everything, just said
by the Permanent Representative ofthe United States.
