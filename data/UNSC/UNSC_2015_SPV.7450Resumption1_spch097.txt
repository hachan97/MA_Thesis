Ms. Shilo (Israel): It is truly absurd to hear a
representative of one of the world's most oppressive
tyrannies lecture the Middle East's only true
democracy about the freedom of the press and the
protection ofjournalists. It is really absurd. Instead of
tackling the profound issue at hand - the protection
of journalists - they have chosen to make baseless
accusations against Israel and have politicized this
debate.

It would be more productive to focus on the reasons
and roots of the repression, torture and murder of
journalists. Everybody knows that many people have
suffered under repressive regimes like Iran's, which
have abolished the freedom of speech and the freedom
of the press, which are pillars of every democracy, like
Israel's, as Council members know. In Iran, dozens of
journalists and bloggers have been arrested. According
to recent reports, at least 30 journalists are under arrest
simply for telling the truth about the regime.

It is absurd that such a repressive regime has the
audacity to attack Israel. Let us instead explore ways
to create the tools and mechanisms needed to stop that
horrendous repression and secure a free press. This
Chamber, we believe, provides the appropriate forum to
determine tangible and practical means to change that
disturbing reality.
