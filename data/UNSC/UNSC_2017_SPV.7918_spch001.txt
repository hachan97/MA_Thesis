The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document 8/2017/287, which contains a letter dated
4 April 2017 from my delegation addressed to the
Secretary-General, transmitting a concept paper on the
item under consideration.

I now give the floor to the Secretary-General.
