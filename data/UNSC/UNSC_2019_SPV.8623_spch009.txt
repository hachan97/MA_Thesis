Mr. Van Shalkwyk (South Africa): As mentioned
in our statement to the Council earlier (see S/PV.8622),
my delegation continues to be very concerned about
the devastating human tragedy unfolding in Syria, in
particular the situation in and around Idlib. The highest
priority of the Council should be to stop the killing and
end the suffering of innocent civilians. There has to be
an immediate end to the violence and talks must begin
to reach a Syrian-led political transition reflecting the
will of the Syrian people.

South Africa condemns all human rights abuses,
in particular violations of the rights of vulnerable
groups such as women, children and ethnic minorities.
South Africa also condemns the lack of respect for
international humanitarian law.

We welcome the initiative taken to develop a
resolution to create an environment necessary to
provide those in need with much-needed humanitarian
support. However, my delegation is concerned at the
politicization of the humanitarian situation. We instead
believe that the Council should strictly focus on helping
those caught in the middle of this devastating conflict.
It is for this reason that South Africa voted in favour
of the co-penholders' draft resolution (S/2019/756),
as we believe that the dire humanitarian situation on
the ground outweighs our concerns regarding some
elements of the text.
