Mr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): I wish to
convey the Spanish delegation's unreserved satisfaction
that this resolution, so important for the future of Iraq,
was unanimously adopted. Spain was a resolute
sponsor of the draft resolution, convinced that it
constituted an important step towards improving the
lives of the them and restoring to them control of their
own destiny. We believe that the resolution is good
news for the Iraqi people, for the region and for the
United Nations. Iraq deserved - and deserves - the
sincere consensus of the Security Council and its
undivided support and unity. It is a people who have
suffered three decades of dictatorship and who must
see a better future before it. The resolution should help
to achieve that.

The region will also benefit from a country that is
moving towards normalcy and that certainly will have
the cooperation of neighbouring countries and the
international community.

Lastly, it is good news for this Council and the
United Nations, because differences of the past are
being reduced. From the unity, which we trust will be
unrestricted, we will be able to make efforts that will
be beneficial to those who most need them - in other
words, the people of Iraq.

I would like to express best wishes for the donors
conference in Madrid, to which this resolution gives
the momentum that many of us wanted and called for.
We believe that that conference can and must be a
milestone in the development of the Iraqi people.
