The President: I thank Mr. Klein for that
excellent briefing, which augments the report of the

In accordance with the understanding reached in
the Council's prior consultations, I should now like to
invite Council members to informal consultations to
continue our discussion of the subject.

The meeting rose at 11.10 a.m.
