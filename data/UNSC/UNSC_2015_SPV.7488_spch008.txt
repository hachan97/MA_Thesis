Mrs. Kawar (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): Jordan
welcomes the agreement reached on the Iranian
nuclear issue, as well as the political and diplomatic
efforts made by China, France, Germany, the Russian
Federation, the United Kingdom, the United States and
the European Union to achieve it.

Jordan has always called for a peaceful diplomatic
solution to the Iranian nuclear issue. Therefore,
Jordan supports any steps taken to entrench regional
and international peace and security and stability,
particularly in the current conditions prevailing in the
Middle East. We hope that the agreement signed between
the P5+1 and Iran will promote further confidence
among the States ofthe region. We also hope that it will
have positive repercussions on all States of the region
and on the security and stability of their peoples. And
we hope that it will serve as a constructive step towards
preventing a new arms race in the Middle East region
and that it will rid the region of all weapons of mass
destruction, including nuclear weapons.

In conclusion, we stress the importance of the
role of the International Atomic Energy Agency in
following up and implementing the agreement and
providing the Security Council with regular reports
on Iran's implementation in accordance with the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action.
