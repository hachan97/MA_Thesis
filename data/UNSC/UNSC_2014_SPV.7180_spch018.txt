The President: I shall now make a statement in my
national capacity.

The Republic of Korea voted in favour of draft
resolution S/2014/348. The situation in Syria requires
resolute and swift action by the Security Council.
Seeking accountability should be part of that action,
because sustainable peace is not possible without
justice. That is why we voted in favour of the draft
resolution, which referred the crimes against humanity
in Syria to the International Criminal Court.

It is extremely regrettable that the Council was
not able to agree to take action due to the vetoes. We
are letting down the aspirations of the international
community and of the Syrian people. It is also
disappointing to see the misplaced perception that
efforts to deliver justice cannot be compatible with
efforts to seek a political solution.

Having said that, I still believe that the Council
cannot afford to take today's vote as a lasting setback
in our efforts. The current situation on the ground is
simply too serious and continues to call for effective
action on the part of the Council. The Republic of Korea
remains committed to working with other members to
answer the call.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

The representative of France has asked for the floor
to make a further statement.
