The Secretary-General: We should all be
gratified that the Council has come together to chart
the way forward in Iraq. As members know, I have
always held that the unity of the Council is the
indispensable foundation for effective action to
maintain international peace and security and
international law.

The Council has adopted a resolution that spells
out the assistance it expects the United Nations to give
to the people of Iraq in coordination with the
occupying Powers, which have the responsibility for
the effective administration of the territory. The
mandate which the Security Council has given us
involves complex and difficult tasks, but we will carry
it out to the best of our ability, just as we are already
carrying out our vital task of humanitarian relief.

Whatever differences there have been in the
recent past, we now have a new basis on which to
work, and we must all work very hard, keeping the
interests of Iraqis at the forefront of all our efforts. Our
most important task will be to ensure that the people of
Iraq - men and women alike - are able as soon as
possible, through a transparent and impartially
managed political process, to form a free and
representative Government of their own choice, so that
they can regain their national sovereignty and build a
stable and prosperous Iraq at peace with its neighbours.

The United Nations will play its full part in this
international effort. The Security Council has asked me
to name a Special Representative to lead on our side. I
will do so without delay. The full support of all
members of the Council will be essential and I am
confident that my Representative will have that
support.
