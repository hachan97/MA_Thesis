Mr. Grauls (Belgium): This is the seventh
90-day report to the Security Council in accordance
with paragraph 18 (h) of resolution 1737 (2006). The
report covers the period 14 June to 11 September 2008,
during which the Committee held one session of
informal consultations. Allow me to begin by updating
the Council on a matter I referred to in my previous
report.

The Council may recall that, following media
reports that a State had publicly announced a
contravention of resolutions 1747 (2007) and 1803
(2008) on its territory with respect to the export ban on
arms and related materiel from Iran, the Committee
addressed letters to the two States concerned seeking
clarification and additional information. The
Committee has received a reply only from the State
that made the announcement, providing explanations of
the actions taken by that State to address the situation
and containing assurances that that State would
continue to fully implement the relevant resolutions.

1 shall now turn to issues relating to the
implementation of resolution 1737 (2006). Paragraph
13 (d) of the resolution contains an exemption to the
assets freeze for activities directly related to the items
specified in subparagraphs 3 (b) (i) and (ii) of the
resolution, which have been notified by the relevant
States to the Committee. The Committee received one
such notification from the International Atomic Energy
Agency.
Paragraph 15 of resolution 1737 (2006), which
also contains an exemption to the assets freeze for
contracts entered into prior to the listing of persons and
entities in the annexes to resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747
(2007) and 1803 (2008), provides for notifications by
the relevant States to the Committee of the intention to
make or receive payments or to authorize the
unfreezing of funds for that purpose. The Committee
received one such notification.

The Committee also received a letter from a
Member State informing the Committee of the delivery
of items relevant to the construction of the nuclear
power plant in Bushehr, lran.

With regard to reporting by States on their
implementation of the relevant measures in all three
resolutions, the figures are as follows: 89 reports under
resolution 1737 (2006), 76 reports under resolution
1747 (2007) and 56 reports under resolution 1803
(2008).

Let me now turn to a specific measure under
paragraph 10 of resolution 1803 (2008). In that
paragraph, the Council called upon all States to
exercise vigilance over the activities of financial
institutions in their territories with all banks domiciled
in Iran, in particular with Bank Melli and Bank
Saderat, and their branches and subsidiaries abroad, in
order to avoid such activities contributing to the
proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities, or to the
development of nuclear weapon delivery systems, as
referred to in resolution 1737 (2006). Yesterday, 10
September, a member of the Committee provided to the
other members a briefing on its efforts to implement
paragraph 10 of resolution 1803 (2008).

Finally, Mr. President, two letters that were
addressed to you and subsequently issued as documents
of the Security Council - the first submitted jointly by
France, the United Kingdom and the United States on
lAugust and the second submitted by Iran on
15 August - were both circulated within the
Committee for the information of members. The letter
from the three States, which was copied to me in my
capacity as Chairman, contained a list of banks
domiciled in Iran and their branches and subsidiaries
abroad. The list was intended to assist States in their
implementation of paragraph 10 of resolution 1803
(2008). The letter from Iran was a direct response to
the letter from the three States.
08-50335

Lastly, the Committee received a written request

for certain specific information from a Member State,
which the members are currently considering.
