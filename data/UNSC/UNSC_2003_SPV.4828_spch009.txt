Mr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): The result
of the vote was very disappointing. The Council had to
send a clear message with regard to the announcement
regarding the possible expulsion of the leader of the
Palestinian National Authority - an action that not
only would have no legal basis but, as all members of
the Council know, would also be an enormous political
error that could have very serious consequences.

My delegation has always spoken out against all
acts of terrorism; nothing can justify such acts. Clearly
there was room for improvement in the draft resolution
in that respect, although the operative part did include
a demand for an end to all acts of terrorism.
Furthermore, it expressed fully its support for the
efforts of the Quartet. It was necessary to give a clear,
unambiguous and unanimous message about the
mistake that expelling the leader of the Palestinian
Authority would represent. I therefore regret that the
Council was unable to find unanimity on that issue.
