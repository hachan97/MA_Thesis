The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as the representative of Kazakhstan.

We thank Special Representative Salame,
Ambassador Irina Schoulgin Nyoni and Ms. Sharief
for their comprehensive briefings. We fully support
the view that the solution to the situation in Libya
must be primarily and solely peaceful and that the
ownership of the political process must belong to the
Libyans themselves.

The Libyan Political Agreement should remain
the only viable framework throughout the transitional
period. The adoption of the new Libyan constitution,
the adoption of the electoral law by the House of
Representatives and the holding of national elections
will facilitate overcoming political division and help to
bring about permanent stability.

International efforts to advance political
reconciliation in Libya should be consolidated under
the leadership of the United Nations-led action plan. It
is important that the Security Council maintain unity
and support the work of Special Representative Salame'.

At the same time, we must attach great importance
to the development agenda, and it is vital that Libya's oil
resources be used for the benefit of the Libyan people.

Issues of impunity and violations of human rights,
the grave humanitarian plight and the dire situation of
migrants should be addressed urgently.

Strict compliance with the embargo on the supply
of arms to Libya must be enforced.

Finally, Kazakhstan stands ready to support the
Council's endeavour to bring about lasting peace and
prosperity in Libya.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.
