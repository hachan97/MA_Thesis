Mr. Richardson (United States of America): As
President Clinton recently stated, Deng Xiaoping was an
extraordinary figure on the world stage. Mr. Deng spurred
China's historic economic reform programme and opened
his country to the outside world. His historic visit to our
country in 1979 laid the foundation for the rapid exchange
of relations and cooperation between China and the United
States.

On behalf of the United States Government and the
people of the United States, we offer our condolences to his
family and to the Chinese people. He will be sorely missed.
