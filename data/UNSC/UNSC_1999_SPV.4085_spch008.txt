Mr. Granovsky (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We too express our gratitude to the Assistant
Secretary-General, Mr. Annabi, for his comprehensive
briefing.

We note with satisfaction the recent positive trend in
the situation in East Timor, which is reflected in Australia's
fifth periodic report on the operations of the International
Force, East Timor (INTERFET) (S/ 1999/ 1248, annex). That
report speaks of good prospects for achieving security and
indicates that the threat posed by militias has essentially
been eliminated. In that connection I should like to
emphasize the importance of a well-planned transition from
INTERFET to a United Nations peacekeeping operation,
which will be the objective of a comprehensive transition
plan.

East Timor faces a multitude of tasks, dealing with
which will require support from the international
community and the active involvement of the East
Timorese themselves. Exceptionally important in that
connection is the establishment of a mechanism for
consultation with the inhabitants of the territory, of
institutions of self-government and of other institutions of
civil society.

Needless to say, the situation in East Timor is not
free of problems, as we can see from the note by the
Secretary-General of 10 December 1999 on the situation
of human rights in East Timor (A/54/660) and from
media reports of the recent discovery of mass graves in
the territory. There is also the urgent issue of temporarily
displaced persons.

Nonetheless, progress towards normalization in East
Timor is evident. We are convinced that a climate
conducive to this has been created largely thanks to
United Nations staff, first and foremost the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sergio
Vieira de Mello.

In conclusion, I must reaffirm that Russia intends to
participate in the activities of the various components of
the United Nations Transitional Administration in East
Timor.
