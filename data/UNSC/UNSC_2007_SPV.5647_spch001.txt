The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Germany and the Islamic Republic
of Iran in which they request to be invited to
participate in the consideration of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
consideration of the item without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Mottaki
(Islamic Republic of Iran) took a seat at the
Council table; Mr. Matussek (Germany) took the
seat reserved for him at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2007/ 170, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by France, Germany and the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

I wish to draw the attention of the members of the
Council to document S/2007/100, which contains the
note by the President of the Security Council
transmitting the report of the Director General of the
International Atomic Energy Agency.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements before the voting.
