Mr. Bessho (Japan): Japan fully shares the
international community's serious concerns about
the worsening humanitarian situation in Aleppo and
believes that it requires an urgent response. With the
extremely cold and rainy weather, more than 80,000
internally displaced persons are reported to be in very
dire circumstances. It is very important that the Council
has convened today on this matter. We must take action
to help civilian Syrians. The Secretary-General has
made a very clear statement today; the United Nations
underlines the obligation to protect civilians and abide
by international humanitarian law and human rights
law. That is especially the responsibility of the Syrian
Government, and its allies, as it continues with its
military action in Aleppo.

On 8 December, the Council shared its views on
two things: humanity first, and that we must advance
a political process based on resolution 2254 (2015).
It was meaningful that the Council could at least
share that view on Syria for the first time in a long
time. The core message was that there is no military
solution to the Syrian crisis. This long-lasting conflict
has deeply scarred the Syrian people, physically and
psychologically. And hatred provides grounds for
extremism, benefiting no one.

Today the Council must think of the Syrian people
above all. A prompt cessation of hostilities is needed,
together with humanitarian aid and the advancement
of the political process. We must demonstrate, not
with words but with action, that the international
community will not abandon the people of Syria even
in this dark hour.
