Ms. Fang Liu (spoke in Chinese): I again thank the
Security Council for its invitation to our organization
to brief members on international ciil aviation security.
I thank all representatives for their remarks, their
attention to civil aviation, security measures, their
recognition of our work and their support.

I concur with the remarks made today concerning
the importance of civil aviation security and the need for
international cooperation in that regard. We also need
to implement resolution 2309 (2016) effectively. We
need to invest more in aviation security, in particular in
technical support and training for developing countries,
so that all countries can effectively implement the civil
aviation standards of the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) in order to better safeguard
aviation security.
We also recognize the need to support ICAO's Global
Aviation Security Plan and its implementation. ICAO
will continue to play a leading role in international civil
aviation security and further enhance its cooperation
with the United Nations, the Security Council, the
Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate,
the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1373
(2001) concerning counter-terrorism, and the new
United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism so that
Member States can be better equipped and positioned
to fight terrorism, implement the ICAO civil aviation
security standards. I am ready to further engage with
the Security Council on aviation security and to brief
members on new developments.

The meeting rose at 12.10p.m.
