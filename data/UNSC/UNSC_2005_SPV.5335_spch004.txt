Mr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): My
delegation voted in favour of both resolutions because
we believe that the Peacebuilding Commission is a
necessity in the Organization and that it will play a
crucial role in assisting countries emerging from
conflict to restore peace and stability.

With regard specifically to the second resolution
adopted, 1646 (2005), my delegation voted in favour,
after much hesitation. Very simply, the text put before
us was hardly in line with the first resolution, 1645
(2005), especially as regards the representation of
members of the Security Council in the Peacebuilding
Commission.
