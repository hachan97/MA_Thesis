Sir John Sawers (United Kingdom): The
resolution that we have adopted today is a unanimous
response by the Security Council to a request from the
Government of Iraq. The resolution recognizes the
Iraqi request to retain the presence of the multinational
force (MNF) in Iraq and extends for 12 months that
force's mandate on the terms set out in resolution 1546
(2004), as well as the arrangements for the
Development Fund for Iraq and the International
Advisory and Monitoring Board. The resolution comes
with the assurance that the Iraqi Government may, at
any time, seek a review of the arrangements or, indeed,
the termination of the MNF's mandate.

The United Kingdom will continue working in
close partnership with the Iraqi Government, both
bilaterally and as a contributor to the multinational
forces.

On 16 December, last Sunday, security
responsibility for Basra province passed from the
MNF-I to Iraqi control. Basra was the last of the four
southern provinces of Iraq previously under the
security control of the United Kingdom-led
Multinational Division South-East and the Iraqi
authorities now have security responsibility and control
in nine out of Iraq's 18 provinces.

Handing back lead responsibility for security in
Basra to the Iraqi Government is not the end of the
United Kingdom's involvement in Iraq or in the south.
We are determined to fulfil our obligations and
commitments to the Government and the people of
Iraq. United Kingdom forces will continue to operate
in an overwatch capacity, providing training, mentoring
and advice into the future, retaining the capability to
re-intervene in support of the Iraqi security forces, if
required. We will take a decision in spring of next year
on the next phase of our military presence.

As security continues to improve, we are
continuing our efforts to promote effective economic
governance in the south and are stepping up our work
to support investment and business activity.
