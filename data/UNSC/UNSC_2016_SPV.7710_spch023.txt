Mr. Mohamed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic):
Mr. President, I wish to thank you for giving me the
opportunity to take the floor once again.

In response to the comments made by the Prosecutor,
I should like to underscore that I limited myself in my
comments on Darfur and on the jurisdiction of the
Court, basing myself on accounts that come from the
United Nations and from the African Union, which is
recognized by the United Nations.

I should like to underscore a fundamental fact
concerning justice. The Prosecutor is a part of the
Court, but the Prosecutor has become a party to the
dispute today. The mission of the Court is to restore
justice. However, the Prosecutor of the Court, as well
as the other Prosecutors, have chosen to be both judge
and jury. This also applies to the previous Prosecutor.
We would like to ask the Prosecutor, what crime did the
President commit by visiting South Africa?

Concerning the contradiction between articles 27
and 98, I should like to refer the Council to the comments
made by the first Prosecutor, Mr. Kirsch, on the issue
of constructive ambiguity in the interpretation of the
two articles. This contradiction and this constructive
ambiguity, as described by the President of the Court,
was exploited and continues to be exploited in order to
go after Heads of State and to attack States, in particular
States that do not have any influence in the world. That
is what the Court has based its action on to date.

The meeting rose at12.55p.m.
