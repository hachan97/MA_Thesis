Mr. Safronkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation's firm stance is
that international and regional efforts with regard
to Burundi will be successful only if they are taken
in strict respect for the independence, sovereignty
and territorial integrity of the country. Resolution
2303 (2016) must be implemented in cooperation,
coordination and consultation with the legitimate
Government of Burundi, within frameworks agreed
with it, and fostering a mutually beneficial dialogue.

The activities of the United Nations should be
based on these fundamental criteria. We are convinced
that our position will be fully taken into account by
Mr. Benomar, the Special Envoy of the Secretary-
General, whom we fully endorse.
