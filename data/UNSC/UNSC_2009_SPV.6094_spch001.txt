representatives of Afghanistan, Australia, Canada, the
Czech Republic, Germany, India, the Islamic Republic
of Iran, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and Pakistan, in
which they request to be invited to participate in the

conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the consideration of the item, without
the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant

There being no objection, it is so decided.

consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its

the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan.

It is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its
