Sir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): Thank
you, Mr. President, for your kind words addressed to me at
the beginning of this meeting, and congratulations on your
assumption of the presidency.

By its decisions of 5 August and 31 October, Iraq has
put itself in flagrant violation of its obligations under the
relevant resolutions of the Council. It is right that the
Council should react formally and unanimously to this
latest attempt to challenge its authority and that of the
United Nations as a whole.

This resolution reiterates the Council's full support
for the Special Commission and the IAEA. Their work is
absolutely vital. Iraq's constant attempts to undermine
them and avoid its obligations only delay the moment
when the decision can be taken on the lifting of sanctions.
Cooperation, not confrontation, is the only way out from
sanctions for Iraq.

Certain speakers have given their views on the
meaning of this resolution as regards the possible use of
force. Let me set out briefly the View of the United
Kingdom. It is well established that the authorization to
use force given by the Security Council in 1990 may be
revived if the Council decides that there has been a
sufficiently serious breach of the conditions laid down by
the Council for the ceasefire.

In the resolution we have just adopted, the Council
has condemned the Iraqi decision to cease all cooperation
as a flagrant violation of its obligations.

This resolution sends a clear message to Iraq:
resume cooperation now. If Iraq does so, the Council has
spelt out unambiguously that it stands ready to conduct a
comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with its
obligations under the relevant resolutions and what steps
remain to be taken. We hope Iraq will respond positively
and resume full cooperation soon.
