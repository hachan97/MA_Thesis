The President (spoke in French): I thank
Ambassador Shalgham for his briefing.

I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of
the Security Council, to express appreciation to the
outgoing Chairmen for the manner in which they have
discharged the important responsibilities entrusted to
them by the Council.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 11.05 am.
