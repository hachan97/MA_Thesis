Mr. Auvaart (Estonia): I echo the condolences expressed by the representative of Germany. We thank the United States and the co-facilitators for all their hard work. With regard to the current situation in Afghanistan, we believe that resolution 2513 (2020) is well-balanced overall and highlights the main views of the Security Council. It is now more essential than ever for the Council to voice its full support to Afghanistan so that President Ghani may form an inclusive Government acceptable to all. Like previous speakers, we also oppose any action to establish a parallel Government and any illegal use of force to resolve political differences. We call for a sustained reduction of violence in order to create an environment conducive to intra-Afghan negotiations. In that regard, the elements of conditionality to the Taliban reflected in the resolution just adopted are very important. We consider the events in Doha and Kabul on 29 February as important first steps towards beginning the intra-Afghan negotiations and ending the conflict. The only way towards a political settlkement and a permanent ceasefire is through inclusive negotiations. We stress that the achievements guaranteed by the Afghan Constitution in ensuring fundamental freedoms and human rights, particularly those of women and children, are inalienable and should be underscored in the future intra-Afghan negotiations. Today's meeting of the Group of Friends of Women in Afghanistan was a useful. Finally, considering the important time ahead in Afghanistan, Estonia recognizes the active role of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan in supporting Afghanistan on the path towards peace and security is of the utmost importance.
