Mr. Melki (France) (spoke in French): We
welcome the adoption of resolution 2466 (2019), which
renews the mandate of the United Nations Mission
for Justice Support in Haiti for the last time. The text,
which includes a mention of Chapter VII of the Charter
of the United Nations, provides the Mission with the
necessary means to conclude the tasks that were
entrusted to it, implement all the recommendations
of the Secretary-General and enable the Secretariat to
expedite the transition to a special political mission
focused on providing strategic advice to Haitian
authorities, especially the Haitian National Police. This
final renewal of the mandate is not only a new page
that is being turned in the relations between the United
Nations and Haiti, but a new chapter altogether. France
remains more than ever committed to ensuring success
in that regard.
