Ms. Power (United States of America): In the spirit
of this sober commemoration, I shall be very brief.

First, I would say that every country and every
people should grapple with their history, and grappling
with that history is a prerequisite to reconciliation. We
in this country are going through something like that
right now after the events in Charleston with respect
to the racial divisions that persist in our society.
Every society should look back, but the Russian
representative's intervention just now shows not only
that Russia is prepared to deny the genocide, but also
that, accompanying that denial, it simply wants to
distract from that core fact.

There is no distracting from the core fact that
8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed systematically
because they were Bosnian Muslims by Bosnian Serbs
under the leadership of Radovan Karadiic' and Ratko
Mladic' - not by the Serbian people - and that those
families are grieving today doubly, first and foremost
because they lost their loved ones, and secondly because
our collective effort to recognize and commemorate the
genocide in Srebrenica was vetoed by Russia.
