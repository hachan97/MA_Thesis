The President (spoke in French): There are no
more names inscribed on the list of speakers.

Before adjourning the meeting, as this is the last
scheduled meeting of the Council for the month of
March, I would like to express the sincere appreciation
of the delegation of France to the members of the
Council and the Secretariat for their support. After a
busy month, we can congratulate ourselves on reaching
consensus on several important issues within our
purview. We could not have done it alone or without the
hard work, support and positive contributions of every
delegation and the representatives of the Secretariat,
including the conference service officers, interpreters,
translators, verbatim reporters and security staff.

As we end our presidency, I know I speak on behalf
of the Council, beginning with the representative of
the Dominican Republic, in wishing good luck to the
delegation of Germany during its presidency in the
month of April.

The meeting rose at 6.05 pm.
