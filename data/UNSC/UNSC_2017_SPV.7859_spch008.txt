The President: I shall now make a statement in my
national capacity as the representative of Sweden.

I would just like to echo the last point by the
representative of Italy, which related to the way that
the peace agreements have dealt with, and how the
Colombian Government deals with, the particular issue
of the children.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

After all those very encouraging and supporting
statements, I now give the floor to the representative
of Colombia.
