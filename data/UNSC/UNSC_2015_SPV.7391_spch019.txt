Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I would like to make two brief comments.

First, some members of the Council have abused
today's meeting, which is supposed to be devoted
to the activities of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Particularly unfortunate
was the statement made by the representative of
the United Kingdom, which was devoted entirely to
Ukraine. Our British colleague once again painted
a very one-sided and distorted picture of what is
happening. It is apparent that the United Kingdom
does not have a complete understanding of the OSCE's
role, and that is clearly a result of the fact that Britain
is rapidly losing its international position, including
on the European continent. The representative of the
United States made a statement in a similar key, and
that country's role throughout the Ukrainian crisis has
been exclusively destructive. All we can do now is hope
that the United States will not try to put a wrench in the
works of the Normandy process.

Secondly, these days such comments are often used
to achieve a desired political and psychological effect.
The conflict in Ukraine is the most complex crisis
Europe has seen since the end of the Cold War. It is
clear that the crisis needs to be assessed in a calculated
way. Let us recall that, even after the end of the Cold

War, war broke out in the territory of the former
Yugoslav Republic and NATO bombed Serbia. In many
cases, the causes for such crises are the very forces
that provoked the crisis in Ukraine. Unfortunately, the
geopolitical ambitions of a number of forces precluded
the flowering of a harmonious political order on the
European continent following the end of the Cold
War. We need to draw lessons from that. The OSCE's
mission is to play a very important role in the process
of such rethinking.
