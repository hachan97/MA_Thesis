Mr. Wang Xuexian (China) (interpretation from Chinese): The Foreign Ministers of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Croatia and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia signed an agreement of principles in Geneva
today as a basis for negotiating an end to the conflict in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. This is a positive development for
which the Chinese delegation expresses its heartfelt
welcome.

On the question of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the
Chinese delegation has always maintained that its
sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence
should be respected by the international community. A
proper solution should be found through peaceful
negotiations - that is, acceptable to the parties
concerned. It has been borne out that peaceful negotiation
is the only right choice for the settlement of the question
in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Based on its principled position, China is not in
favour of using air strikes to exert pressure. Doing so will
not help the settlement of the question, but, rather, will
further complicate the situation and create obstacles to a
political settlement. We believe in the light of the
agreement of principles reached by the parties concerned
that it is necessary to cease the air strikes immediately so
as to create a conducive environment for the process of
the political settlement.

The options for ending the protracted conflict in
Bosnia and Herzegovina are complicated. Although an
agreement of principles has been reached by the parties
concerned, many substantive issues still remain to be
resolved. Therefore, we hope that the parties concerned
will demonstrate the greatest possible political will and
continue their efforts in a constructive spirit and also take
to heart the fundamental interests of various nations in
this area in order to further move forward the process of
a comprehensive political settlement so that lasting peace
and stability can be achieved in the area of the former
Yugoslavia.
