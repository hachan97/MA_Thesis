The President: I thank Mr. Ibn Chambas for his
generous comments on the development, positions and
initiatives of Ghana.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers
to limit their statements to no more than four minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing and to
deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.

I now give the floor to His Excellency Sheikh
Hamad bin Jassem bin Jabr Al-Thani, First Deputy
Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the
State of Qatar.
