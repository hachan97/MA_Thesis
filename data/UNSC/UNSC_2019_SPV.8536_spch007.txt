Mr. Yao Shaojun (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
political process towards peace in South Sudan has
made significant progress since the end of last year.
At present, with the joint support of the African Union
(AU), the Intergovernmental Authority on Development
(IGAD), countries of the regional and the international
community at large, the South Sudanese Government
and major political parties are demonstrating
unprecedented resolve and good will in implementing
the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the
Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan, as a result
of which the security situation in South Sudan has
greatly improved.

As the primary body for the maintenance of
international peace and security, the Security Council
should send positive messages, adjust its South
Sudanese-related measures in a timely manner, fully
support the mediation efforts of the AU, IGAD and
countries of the region and encourage the parties in
South Sudan to pursue their active engagement in
the political process in order to maintain the current
positive momentum.

Last July, the Security Council adopted resolution
2428 (2018), which imposed some measures, including
an arms embargo, on South Sudan. China abstained
in the voting on that resolution. China still does not
support an arms embargo on South Sudan and therefore
abstained in the voting on resolution 2471 (2019),
which was just adopted by the Council. China hopes
that the Council will make timely adjustments to the
relevant measures in the light of the changes on the
ground in South Sudan and help the South Sudanese
parties to implement the revitalized agreement and
promote governance and security capacity-building in
South Sudan.

Last but not least, I also wish to thank the Indonesian
presidency of the Council for its excellent work during
the month of May.
