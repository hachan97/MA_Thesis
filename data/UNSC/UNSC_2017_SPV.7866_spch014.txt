Mr. Alemu (Ethiopia): We also welcome the
Council's unanimous adoption today of resolution
2337 (2017), and we appreciate the work done by our
Senegalese colleagues, who have discharged their
responsibilities with flexibility and resolve in drawing
the Council's attention to the issue as early as possible.
We have indeed been following the developments in
The Gambia very closely. In line with the position
of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) and the African Union, Ethiopia fully
supports respect for constitutional order in The Gambia
and for a peaceful transfer of power aimed at preserving
peace and stability there.

The political crisis in The Gambia could have serious
ramifications not just for the country itself but for the
entire region. We have seen how quickly things there
have deteriorated and, for that reason, every possible
effort must be made to ensure that it does not descend
into chaos. The State institutions should not be allowed
to collapse. While Ethiopia attaches great importance
to that matter, we also believe that the usurpation of
power and an unconstitutional move to retain it should
not be allowed to succeed. In that regard, we are fully
behind the ECOWAS regional efforts to resolve the
current political impasse through dialogue, in full
conformity with the country's Constitution and with
respect for the will of the Gambian people. We believe
that it is important to ensure that the Security Council
supports the efforts of ECOWAS and the African Union
and continues to send a unified message.

That is why Ethiopia supported the adoption
of today's resolution. We commend Senegal for
accommodating the concerns expressed by members
during the negotiation process, with a view to facilitating
the Council's unity. It is vital that we maintain that
unity of purpose. We also salute all the members who
showed the flexibility needed to ensure the resolution's
adoption by consensus.
