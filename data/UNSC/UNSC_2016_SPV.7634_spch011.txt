Mr. Yoshikawa (Japan): It is zero hours Damascus
time, 27 February. By adopting unanimously the
new resolution 2268 (2016), we have endorsed in
full the cessation of hostilities in Syria announced
on 22 February by the United States and the Russian
Federation. I welcome efforts by Secretary Kerry and
Minister Lavrov, co-Chairs of the International Syria
Support Group, which opened up an opportunity to end
this long-lasting conflict. Resolution 2268 (2016) was
sponsored by the Russian Federation and the United
States, which I find most welcome. The adoption
and implementation of resolution 2268 (2016) should
lead to the full implementation of the most important
resolution, namely, resolution 2254 (2015). It is my
hope that the Russia-United States cooperation, as well
as cooperation among other partners, will continue and
be strengthened in the process of the implementation of
both resolutions.
I should now like to thank Mr. Staffan de Mistura
for his briefing as well as, most important, his
tireless efforts to move the political process forward.
Japan welcomes the announcement of the scheduled
resumption of intra-Syrian talks on 7 March. As the
Special Envoy said, the start and maintenance of the
cessation of hostilities and the improvement of the dire
humanitarian situation are indispensable elements for
the success of those talks.

Japan has provided continuous assistance to Syria
for the development of its economy and improvements
in the livelihood of the people. It has always been a
matter of the highest priority for Japan that the people
of Syria be able to enjoy better lives. However, since the
crisis began, more than a quarter of a million Syrians
have been killed and 4.6 million have fled their country.
Japan will continue to work with others towards a
lasting political settlement by restoring confidence
among the parties through assistance that benefits all
Syrians, without marginalizing any groups.
