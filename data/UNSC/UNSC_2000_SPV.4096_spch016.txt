The President: Thank you, Mr. Ambassador, for
your important statement and your kind words. I thank
you very much for your support of our efforts this month.
I look forward to continuing to see your support for these
efforts as well.

We are now particularly pleased to call on the man
to whom this project will fall. As we have said many
times: it is not a "month of Africa", it is going to be a
"year of Africa", as President Chiluba said. And the baton
- the gavel - will be shortly passed to Ambassador
Listre.
