The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of Cote d'Ivoire, in which he
requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of
the item on the Council's agenda. In accordance with
the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the
Council, to invite that representative to participate in
the discussion without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Djangoni-
Bi (cote d'Ivoire) took a seat reservedfor him at
the side of the Council Chamber.

The President (spoke in French): Before opening
the floor to speakers, I wish to remind all participants
that they must limit their statements to no more than
seven minutes in order to enable the Council to work
efficiently within its timetable. I thank you for your
understanding and cooperation.

The first speaker on my list this afternoon is His
Excellency Mr. Roland Y. Kpotsra, Minister for
Foreign Affairs of Togo, whom I invite to take a seat at
the Council table.

Mr. Minister, I would like to extend to you my
country's condolences and those of other Council
members upon the death of our brother, Koffi Panou,
and we would like to extend these condolences to your
country and to the family of our beloved brother.

I now invite you to make your statement.
