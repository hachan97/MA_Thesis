Mr. Farhfidi (Afghanistan) (spoke in French): I
am very grateful to Mr. Guehenno, Ambassador
Nishimura and Mr. Braun, who have given briefings
that have elicited many very relevant questions about
Afghanistan, even though some of these questions have
already been answered to some extent. I, too, look
forward to the answers that will be given.

I am grateful also to Mr. Guehenno for having
informed the Council of the death of a great Afghan
patriot, Juma Mohammedi. The chartered aircraft he
was in crashed, and a number of Pakistani officials
were also killed. I extend my condolences to the
representative of Pakistan.

Mr. Mohammedi was a man of tremendous
experience. He was a hydrologist and also a
management expert. Obviously, he was very familiar
with Afghanistan's extensive water resources. He was a
member of the Afghan royal Government and a
minister in the Daoud Republic. He left his post only
when he was imprisoned as a cabinet member of Prince
Daoud's Government. Upon his release - a Marxist
regime held power in Afghanistan at that time - he
was immediately hired by the World Bank, which
needed someone like him to work on the waterways
extending from Turkey to Syria. The work was of a
legal and technical nature and Mr. Mohammadi was
occupied with it for several years. In his capacity as a
former Government minister, he then joined Mr.
Karzai's Government.

He was a Pashtun from the Paktika region. He
worked with colleagues and technicians from various
ethnic groups. He was a true patriot and I trust that he
will receive God's blessing.
