Mr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China supports the assumption by the United Nations
of its due role in non-proliferation and therefore
favoured the adoption of a Security Council resolution
on the basis of extensive consultations. The Chinese
delegation took part in the consultations on today's
resolution in a serious, responsible and constructive
manner. We believe that the resolution was adopted in
compliance with existing international law on the illicit
traffic in weapons of mass destruction, their means of
delivery and related materials by non-State actors in
order to prevent the further proliferation of such
weapons. On that basis, the Chinese delegation voted
in favour of the resolution.

The adoption of the resolution on non-
proliferation is of positive significance in deepening
the international community's common understanding
of the issue and in enhancing the international non-
proliferation process. The fundamental purpose of non-
proliferation is to maintain and promote international
and regional peace, stability and security. In
implementing the resolution, it is essential that we
achieve our non-proliferation goals by peaceful means;
undertake international cooperation on the basis of
equality, mutual trust and strict compliance with
international law; and solve our differences through
dialogue. At the same time, we must guarantee the
legitimate rights of all countries, especially developing
countries, to utilize and share dual-use science and
technology and their products for peaceful purposes.
China will work hard with all members of the Security
Council Committee and contribute as it should to the
effective implementation of the resolution.
