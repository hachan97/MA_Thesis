Ms. Rice (United States of America): The United
States welcomes the unanimous adoption of this strong
resolution this afternoon. The Council has met on
numerous occasions in an attempt to find a peaceful
end to the ongoing crisis. We have strongly condemned
the violence. We have urged former President Gbagbo
to step aside so that President Ouattara, as the duly
elected President of Cote d'Ivoire, can govern. We
have stressed our support for the United Nations
Operation in Cote d'Ivoire and its mandate to protect
civilians. And we have adopted targeted sanctions
against those most responsible for obstructing peace.

This resolution sends a strong signal that
Mr. Gbagbo and his followers should immediately
reject violence and respect the will of the Ivorian
people. As violence continues, Cote d'Ivoire stands at a
crossroads. Mr. Gbagbo and his supporters can

continue to cling to power, which will only lead to
more innocent civilians being wounded and killed and
more diplomatic and economic isolation, or
Mr. Gbagbo and his followers can finally reject
violence and respect the will of the Ivorian people. If
that path is chosen, Ivorians can reclaim their country
and rebuild the vibrant economy that was once admired
by all ofAfrica.

The United States urges the Security Council to
support and work with President Ouattara in his efforts
to create a peaceful and prosperous future for all
Ivorians - a future based on inclusive governance,
reunification and reconciliation. We urge all parties to
exercise restraint and to avoid violence against
civilians. Now is the time for all Ivorians to embrace
the path of peace and to unite in rebuilding Cote
d'Ivoire so that future generations can enjoy the
stability and prosperity that all Ivorians deserve.
