Mr. Owada (Japan): Mr. President, permit me at the
outset to offer my congratulations to you on your
assumption of the presidency for April. Japan stands ready
to extend its full support as you go on leading the work of
the Council. I also wish to take this opportunity to pay
tribute to your predecessor, the representative of the
People's Republic of China, for the excellent manner in
which he guided the Council's business during the month
of March.

Japan is deeply concerned about the plight of the
people of Iraq, who are experiencing severe medical and
nutritional problems as a result of the intransigence of the
Government of Iraq, which has necessitated the
application of sanctions by the United Nations.

It is out of this humanitarian concern that Japan
supports the draft resolution which the Council is about
to adopt. In the view of my delegation, the draft
resolution adopts an appropriate and balanced approach to
alleviating the hardships that confront the Iraqi people.
Japan wishes to express its appreciation for the efforts of
the States that have worked out this draft resolution, and
hopes that the Security Council will adopt it by
consensus, which will serve the purpose of sending a
strong and unambiguous message of the international
community to the Iraqi authorities.

Japan urges Iraq to comply faithfully with the terms
of the present draft resolution and to cooperate with the
United Nations in its prompt implementation.

It should be clearly kept in mind, at the same time,
that the well-being of the people of Iraq can be ensured
only when the Government of Iraq faithfully implements
all relevant Security Council resolutions and makes
sincere efforts to rejoin the international community.
