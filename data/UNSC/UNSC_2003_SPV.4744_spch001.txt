the representatives of Australia, Brazil, Fiji, Indonesia,
Japan, New Zealand, Portugal and Timor-Leste in
which they request to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the discussion without the right to
vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the

take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an

procedure to Mr. Kamalesh Sharma, Special
Representative of the Secretary-General for
Timor-Leste and Head of Mission.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Sharma to take a seat at the Council
