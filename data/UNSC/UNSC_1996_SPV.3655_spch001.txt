The President (interpretation from Spanish): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Following consultations among the members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"On 16 April 1996, a Libyan-registered aircraft
flew from Tripoli, Libya, to J eddah, Saudi Arabia. The
Security Council considers this clear Violation of
Council resolution 748 (1992) of 31 March 1992 as
totally unacceptable and calls on Libya to refrain
from any further such Violations. It recalls that
arrangements have been made consistent with
resolution 748 (1992) in order to fly Libyan pilgrims
to perform the Hajj. The Council will review the
matter should further Violations occur.

"The Council has requested the Committee
established pursuant to resolution 748 (1992) to
draw to the attention of Member States their
obligations under resolution 748 (1992) in the event
that Libyan-registered aircraft land in their territory."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/ 1996/18.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.

The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter.

The meeting rose at 11.45 pm.
