The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Afghanistan in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Farhadi

dated 11 September 2006 from Afghanistan addressed
to the Secretary-General.
