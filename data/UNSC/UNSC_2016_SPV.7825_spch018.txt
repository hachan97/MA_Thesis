Mr. Gaspar Martins (Angola): Regrettably, we
felt compelled to abstain in the voting on today's draft
resolution (S/2016/1026), which, ifit had been negotiated
with the sole objective of saving Syrian lives in mind,
would have been adopted by consensus. A resolution
designed to stop the bombing for 24 or 48 hours, or
even seven days, only for it to be resumed immediately
afterwards, is not what is required of the Council. Our
consultations clearly pointed to the outcome we have
just reached - a draft resolution that could not be
adopted, since we did not reach a consensus. Angola
has worked consistently to try to enable the Council
to reach a consensus and will continue to do so. We
should stand united in the face of a situation such as the
one in Syria. I would like to make it clear that Angola
will continue to be engaged in the search for a solution
that can save lives in Syria by stopping the bombing
and ending the war that continues to make victims of
so many.

We need a lasting peace in Syria, notjust in Aleppo,
and I am sure that if the Council continues to act as it
should - in unity, and with a clear goal - we should
be able to reach that goal, as we have done in adopting
previous resolutions on Syria.
