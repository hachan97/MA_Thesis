Mr. Larrain (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish):
The international community is very interested in seeing
real progress in the political process in Angola, recognizing
the fact that Angola is working for the social and economic
development of its population, which has suffered the
ravages of war.

To this end, Government and UNITA leaders must
continue to implement the commitments entered into at
Lusaka two years ago as well as the consolidated timetable
for all outstanding tasks that was approved on 31 October
by the Joint Commission.

As stated in the report of the Secretary-General, the
situation in Angola has remained stable, although tense. The
ceasefire violations and the harassment of the troops of the
United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) are causes for regret. However, the Secretary-General's
report gives us hope that the parties are finally managing to
create a climate that will allow the country to secure peace
and to begin the tremendous development tasks ahead of it.

The formal announcement by UNITA that it has
concluded the quartering of its troops and the declaration by
the Angolan Government that nine UNITA Generals are
joining the Angolan Armed Forces are very encouraging
and important developments and which will contribute to
increased confidence between the parties at this crucial
time.

As regards the current situation, we agree with the
Secretary-General that the mandate of UNAVEM. III must
be extended to 28 February of next year. Therefore, my
delegation supports the draft resolution before us.

I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to pay
a tribute, on behalf of Chile, to all of the civilian, military
and police personnel of UNAVEM. III, as well as to the
staff of the humanitarian programmes and agencies of the
United Nations and of non-governmental organizations.
They all have something in common - they are fighting to
consolidate peace in Angola.
