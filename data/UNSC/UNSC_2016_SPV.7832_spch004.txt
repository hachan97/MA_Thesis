Ms. Sison (United States of America): Today's vote
to renew the mandate of the United Nations Support
Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) should be sending an
unambiguous message to the Libyan people that their
efforts in forging a path to peace and stability are
undertaken with the broad support of the international
community and that the tireless work of UNSMIL is
recognized as critically important and necessary as it
undertakes to support, advise and assist the Government
ofNational Accord. The United States lauds UNSMIL'S
efforts. We look forward to its continued work to
facilitate the Libyan-led political solution to the
challenges facing Libya. We are eager to learn of its
continued progress and we offer it our strong support.
