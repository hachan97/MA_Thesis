The President: Before adjourning the meeting,
as this is the last scheduled meeting of the Council
for the month of February, I should like to express the
sincere appreciation of the delegation of Ukraine to the
members of the Council, especially my colleagues the
Permanent Representatives and their respective staff, as
well as the secretariat of the Council for all the support
that they have given to us.
It has been a busy month indeed and one in which we
rallied to consensus on several important issues within
our purview. We could not have done it alone or without
the hard work, support and positive contributions
of every delegation and the representatives of the
Secretariat, as well as all relevant Conference Services
officers and interpreters.

As we end our presidency, I know that I speak on
behalf of the Council in wishing the delegation of the
United Kingdom good luck in the month of March.

The meeting rose at 1.20pm.
