The President: I thank the representative of Austria
for his kind words addressed to my country and to me.

The next speaker is Mr. Jeno Staehelin, Permanent
Observer of Switzerland to the United Nations, to whom
the Council has extended an invitation. I invite him to
take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
