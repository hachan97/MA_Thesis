Mr. Martinez Blanco (Honduras) (interpretation from Spanish): My delegation wishes to thank the Secretary-
General for submitting the report of the Co-Chairmen of the
Steering Committee of the International Conference on the
Former Yugoslavia concerning the operations of the
International Conference's Mission and the certification of
the closing of the border between the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and the areas of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina under the control of the Bosnian Serb forces.

We have taken due note of the conclusions of the Co-
Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International
Conference on the Former Yugoslavia that the Government
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is continuing to meet
its commitment to close its border with Bosnia and
Herzegovina and that there have been no commercial
transshipments across that border. We also note that the
Conference's Mission enjoys freedom of movement in that
country and that it is being given the cooperation of the
Yugoslav authorities, which continue to enforce current
legislation regarding the closure of the border.

So far this year we have regularly received reports
from the Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the
International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia in
which they have invariably certified that the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia is meeting its commitment to close
the border with the Bosnian Serbs and fulfilling its
unilateral decision of 4 August 1994 to break political and
economic ties with the Serb leaders in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, in order to influence them to agree to
participate in the search for a peaceful, negotiated solution
to the crisis in Bosnia, while also complying with the terms
of the resolutions of this Council by which the sanctions
were imposed.

We therefore believe that the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia is attempting to contribute to the search for a
just and peaceful solution to the Bosnian crisis. My
delegation recognizes the importance of that collaboration,
which was particularly in evidence during the recent
negotiations in Geneva, which concluded with the signing
of a joint declaration of basic principles, creating a new
negotiating framework in that conflict.

My delegation believes that maintaining the
sanctions indefinitely would not really help to resolve the
conflict in Bosnia, but we could hope that lifting them
would help lighten the burden that they represent for the
economic and social development of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia and neighbouring countries, taking into
account the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have
sought shelter in the country because of recent events in
the region.

My delegation hopes that the draft resolution now
before the Council, on which my delegation will vote in
favour, will contribute substantially to motivating the
Belgrade authorities to continue to cooperate with the
international community so that a just and lasting peace
may be achieved in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and also so
that in the near future the Council may consider
definitively revoking the sanctions regime.
