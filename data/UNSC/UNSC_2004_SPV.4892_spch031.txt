The President (spoke in Spanish ): I thank
Ambassador Mekdad for the positive support given by
his delegation last year to our committee.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. Therefore, I wish only to express thanks for the
various statements of Council members and of Member
States who have taken the floor under rule 37. This has
been a useful interactive discussion. Important ideas
have emerged, and suggestions that will no doubt be
borne in mind for the preparation of the resolution that
we shall be looking at later this week. Once again,
thanks to all of you for your participation.

The meeting rose at 1.15 pm.
