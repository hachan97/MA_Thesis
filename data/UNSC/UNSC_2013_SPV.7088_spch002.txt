Mr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): At the outset, we wish to thank the delegation
of Guatemala for its efforts in preparing the text of
resolution 2130 (2013). We abstained in the voting on
the resolution on the basis of the following concerns.

The situation with respect to the exit strategy of the
International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has,
objectively, not improved in any way. On the contrary,
the practice of trial delays, in contravention of the
speedy exit strategy called for in resolution 1966 (2010),
has continued. In our opinion, no comprehensive steps
have been taken to fulfil its provisions. Moreover, the
deadline for achieving that goal has been continuously
pushed back beyond 2014, as reflected, unfortunately,
even in the resolution adopted today. Such a course of
action, as we have noted, is costly not only to some of
the accused, but also to the international community. It
has also resulted in a growing financial burden on the
States Members of the United Nations.

For reasons that largely escape us, our concrete
proposals aimed at correcting this situation have not
been understood by a number of delegations. As a
result, in our View, the text of resolution 2130 (2013)
has taken on no positive changes since resolution 2081
(2012), adopted last year. In such circumstances, our
position on the resolution has also not changed, and as
in 2012 (see S/PV.6889) our delegation abstained in the
voting.

We hope that the Tribunal will take all possible
steps in 2014 to maximize the effective discharge of
its functions in the delivery of justice, objectively and
without bias, while respecting the relevant rights of the
accused. With that in mind, we will develop our future
approach to the work of the Tribunal on its exit strategy.

The meeting rose 0111010 am.
