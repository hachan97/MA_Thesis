The President (spoke in Spanish): There are still
some 38 speakers remaining on my list for this meeting.
Given the lateness of the hour, I intend, with the
concurrence of the members of the Council, to suspend
the meeting until 3 pm.

I would like to once again thank all the speakers
for their constructive contributions to this open
debate, as well as the Prosecutor of the International
Criminal Court and Ms. Prost, the Ombudsperson of
the Committee pursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999)
and 1989 (2011) concerning Al-Qaida and associated
individuals and entities, which is chaired by the
next President of the Security Council for the month
of November.

The meeting was suspended at 1 pm.
