The Secretary-General: Thank you very much,
Mr. President, for that very generous statement. You
have congratulated me, but I should also congratulate
you and all the members of the Council, present and
past alike. In awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to the
United Nations, the Norwegian Nobel Committee has,
of course, honoured the Security Council, which has,
under the Charter, the primary responsibility for
maintaining international peace and security. Indeed, it
has honoured all parts of the Organization, and above
all, as you have said, the men and women who work
for the United Nations in the service of peace,
wherever they may be. Those women and men work
hard every day to make this world a more just, more
peaceful and happier place for all its inhabitants. Many
of them risk their lives, and they deserve this award
richly.

A year ago at the Millennium Summit, our heads
of State and Government reaffirmed the indispensable
role of the United Nations as the common house of the
entire human family. Now the Nobel Committee has
used this prize, in its own words,

"to proclaim that the only negotiable route to
global peace and cooperation goes by way of the
United Nations".

In a world that is growing ever closer and more
interconnected, and yet is still torn by brutal conflicts
and cruel injustice, it is more important than ever that
humanity travel that route, the route described by the
Nobel Committee, and that all of us work hard to pave
the road ahead of it.

All of us who work at the United Nations should
feel proud today, but also humble, because even more
will be expected of us in the future, and perhaps in the
near future. This award is a tribute, above all, to our

colleagues who have made the supreme sacrifice in the The Security Council has thus concluded the
service of humanity. The only true prize for them and present stage of its consideration of the item on its
for us will be peace itself. agenda.
