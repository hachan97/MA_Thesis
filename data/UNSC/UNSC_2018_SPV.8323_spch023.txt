Mr. Griffiths: I am very grateful to all the
members of the Council and to the representative of
the Government of Yemen for their remarks. What I
take from this discussion is, as you indeed summed up
yourself, Madam President, when you were speaking
for the United Kingdom, that there is unanimous
support for the notion of the resumption of political
consultations to resolve this conflict. I take from that
also a confirmation that that should be the primary focus.

Efforts to resolve the crisis in Al-Hudaydah are of
crucial importance, particularly to our colleagues in
the humanitarian agencies. They are important to my
Office in the sense that they can contribute to a sense of
political confidence or, if going in the other direction,
can undermine the creation of political confidence. But
the objective for me, and I think for all the members
of the Council, for which I am most grateful, is the
resumption of political negotiations. They will be
inclusive, and that also, I think, has found support, and
they will look to a sustainable solution, based on the
references and Security Council resolutions. I do not
need to repeat to Council members how we are guided
by those references and those resolutions. But they
will also be guided by the gist of what has been said
today, which is the need for urgent attention to an early
political solution.

We are all reminded constantly - as John did so
eloquently today i that delays in reaching a political
solution cost lives. The math is as simple as that. That
is the reason why we move quickly. I am grateful for
the remarks made by the Permanent Representative of
the United States, who rightly said that it is about time
we started. I feel exactly that impetus, and I am very
grateful for the discussion today.
