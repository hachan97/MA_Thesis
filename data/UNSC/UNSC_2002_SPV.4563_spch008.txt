Sir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): I
very much appreciate the Secretary-General's presence
and what he said to us.

The United Kingdom is firmly committed to the
International Criminal Court (ICC) and will continue to
work for an effective Court, in accordance with our
legal commitments under the Statute and with the
European Union's Common Position.

While we understand United States concerns
regarding the Court, we do not share them. As the
Secretary-General has pointed out, the mandate of the
United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina
(UNMIBH) has come to an end for reasons unrelated to
its substantive presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

We believe that the risk of peacekeeping
personnel appearing before the Court is extremely
small. Under the so-called complementarity principle,
the ICC will take over only if States are unwilling or
unable to investigate. Allegations of crimes will thus,
in most cases, continue to be investigated by the
authorities of the State with jurisdiction. In the United
Kingdom, our authorities would launch an
investigation into any allegations that a British soldier
had committed a crime which fell within the ICC
Statute, so that we can be as certain as it is possible to
be that no British soldier will ever come before the
Court.

We believe also that the international
community's forces in Bosnia, including those of the
United States, are doing an important job and need to
be allowed to complete their role. We therefore very
much regret the United States veto, the reasons for
which do not appear fully clear when the International
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY)
continues to have jurisdiction in the former Yugoslavia
regardless. Like France, we very much hope that we
shall soon be able to find a mutually acceptable
solution.
The United Kingdom pays tribute to the Special
Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to his
whole team in UNMIBH for the superb work that they
have performed to date.
