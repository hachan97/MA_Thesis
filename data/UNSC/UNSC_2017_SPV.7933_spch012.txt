Mr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): Ukraine voted in favour
of resolution 2351 (2017), which extends the mandate
of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in
Western Sahara (MINURSO) for another year. While
we realize that the resolution does not address all
the concerns of some Security Council members, we
would like to thank the United States delegation, as its
penholder, and other colleagues for their dedicated work
on it. We see the document as an effort by the Council
to revive the political process on the issue of Western
Sahara. At the same time, it is also a call to the parties
to rise to their shared responsibility for the future of
the region and its people. From now on, we urge them
to refrain from any actions that may undermine the
ceasefire agreement.

It is urgent that the political process be relaunched
without preconditions and in good faith. That cannot be
achieved without giving full cooperation and assistance
to the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General and
MINURSO. Since Mr. Ross is with us today, this is
a good moment to pay tribute to his dedicated efforts
over the years. I want to stress that finding a just and
lasting solution to the issue of Western Sahara can be
achieved only through a genuine and comprehensive
dialogue that can pave the way to making a settlement
happen. There can be no more excuses for any delay in
taking that path.
