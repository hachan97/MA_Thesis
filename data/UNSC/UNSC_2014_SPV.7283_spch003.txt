understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to
the adoption ofthe draft annual report.

May I take it that the draft report is adopted by the
Council'.7

There being no objection, it is so decided.

This decision will be reflected in a note by the
President of the Security Council to be issued as
document 8/2014/750,

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
