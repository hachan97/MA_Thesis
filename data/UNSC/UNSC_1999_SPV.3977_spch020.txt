The President: I thank the representative of Bahrain
for his kind words addressed to me.

If I might just comment on the clock, which is now
going past the witching hour, we still have five speakers
left plus the responses of the briefers. Because of the
importance of the topic, I would hope that the members of
the Council would indulge us in allowing us to continue
right through without a break. I know that this may do
some damage to members' physical nourishment, but the
nourishment of a higher order that is being supplied so ably
by the speakers thus far, I think, will suffice to keep us
sustained during that period of time. So that will be the
intention of the President, if members are all in agreement.
