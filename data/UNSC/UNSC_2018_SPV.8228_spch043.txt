The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of Peru.

We regret that we were not able to achieve consensus
this afternoon on a draft resolution with regard to the
delicate situation in Syria. We underscore that the
investigation being carried out on the use of chemical
weapons must be complemented by an independent,
impartial and professional mechanism that attributes
responsibility. That is why we abstained in the voting
on this occasion.

We reiterate the need for the Security Council to
regain its sense of unity on this very delicate subject
so that it can fulfil its high responsibilities and thereby
alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people. That
is why we will continue to explore options on this
important matter.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

I remind speakers of the content of presidential
note S/20l7/507 with regard to the length of statements.

I now give the floor to the representative of the
Syrian Arab Republic.
