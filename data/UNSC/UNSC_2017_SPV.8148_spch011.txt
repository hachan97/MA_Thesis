Mr. Sadykov (Kazakhstan): Kazakhstan welcomes
the adoption of the resolution 2396 (2017), which
supplements resolution 2178 (2014), on complex
measures to combat foreign terrorist fighters. We thank
the United States for its initiative to consolidate the
efforts of Member States with a view to preventing and
suppressing the activities of foreign terrorist fighters.

Resolution 2396 (2017) contains a number of new
and important aspects that all States Members of the
United Nations are called on to pay great attention
to in the framework of ongoing regional and national
activities in countering international terrorism. In the
wake of recent developments in the successful liberation
of the territories of Syria and Iraq from the terrorist
group the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, some
terrorists are considering how to implement their evil
intentions in their countries of origin or nationality or
third countries. The international community has to take
preventive, coordinated and effective countermeasures
in that regard.
One timely and important measure is to strengthen
information exchange and the control of passenger
traffic in order to identify foreign terrorist fighters. In
that regard, the role of the International Civil Aviation
Authority, INTERPOL and other international and
regional organizations that have information on
individuals involved in terrorist activities is significant.
Kazakhstan, for its part, will take all the necessary
measures to implement the new resolution on foreign
terrorist fighters in order to counter the threat of
terrorism and radical ideologies.

In conclusion, I would like to reiterate Kazakhstan's
strong commitment to working with all partners in our
region and with the international community to prevent
and combat the activities of foreign terrorist fighters.
