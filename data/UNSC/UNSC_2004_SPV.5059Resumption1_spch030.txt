Mr. Denisov (spoke in Russian): Distinguished
members of the Security Council and participants in
our discussion, first, may I express my satisfaction at
the results of today's open meeting of the Security
Council. I would also like to express my gratitude to
all delegations who have taken part in today's
discussion, and thank them for the words of support
expressed with regard to the current chairmanship of
the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and the work
of our Committee as a whole.

We have had a very constructive and interested
exchange of views and I think it is of great significance
from the standpoint of further improvement of the
methods of work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee.
The comments made and proposals put forward in the
meeting pertaining to the activities of the Counter-
Terrorism Committee will be given the most careful
consideration, with a view to taking them into account
in the future work of the Counter-Terrorism
Committee. Once again I thank all participants for the
active work they have done at this meeting.
