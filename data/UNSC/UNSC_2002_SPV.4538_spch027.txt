The President: Before giving the floor to the
representative of Spain, let me inform members that in
his letter to the Presidency, when he requested
participation in this debate, he also informed us that
following his introductory remarks, he would like to
give the floor to Mr. Hans Dahlgren, Special
Representative of the Presidency of the European
Union to the countries of the Mano River Union.

I call on the representative of Spain. I invite him
to take a seat at the Council table and to make his
statement.
