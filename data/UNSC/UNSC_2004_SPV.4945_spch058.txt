Mr. Haraguchi (Japan): The killing of the Hamas
leader in the Gaza Strip, Mr. Abdel Aziz Al-Rantisi, by
the Israeli Forces was a thoughtless and unjustifiable
act, giving no consideration to its consequences. It
gravely impairs the realization of peace and is
profoundly regrettable.

Japan is deeply apprehensive that this killing,
which followed that of Sheikh Yassin, will not only
lead to further fuelling of the chain of hatred and
violence and make it more difficult to realize the peace
between the Israelis and Palestinians, but will also
affect the entire Middle East region negatively. We
therefore condemn this act by Israel. We urge the
Israeli Government to exercise maximum self-restraint
in order to prevent further deterioration of the
situation.

The efforts for peace by both the Israeli and
Palestinian sides based on the road map are virtually
suspended. Japan considers it very important that the
Palestinian side make the maximum efforts in the
crackdown on the extremists and produce a tangible
result.

Also, we see it as equally important that the
Israeli withdrawal of settlements in the Gaza Strip be
implemented in line with the road map. We strongly
hope the Government of Israel and the Palestinian
Authority will immediately exercise their initiatives to
resume dialogue.
