Mr. Butagira (Uganda): I shall be extremely
brief and make only one point, but before doing so I
wish to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Egeland for
his usual concern about the fate of civilians caught in
armed conflict, and also to register my thanks to him
for the good working relationship existing between his
Department and the Government of Uganda in an effort
to address the humanitarian situation in northern
Uganda.

In Uganda, we View the deliberate targeting of
civilians in armed conflict as totally unacceptable
regardless of the motivation, be it the fight for freedom
or otherwise.

The international community must therefore
resolve to fight that menace. For a long time, the
people of northern Uganda have been the victims of
vicious attacks perpetrated by the so-called Lord's
Resistance Army. There is nothing of the Lord about it;
the apt description should perhaps be "Satanic army".
Under their leader, Joseph Kony, they have cut off
people's limbs and lips, abducted and defiled children,
and committed all manner of atrocities. For some time,
they were regarded as a Ugandan affair, until recently
when they started committing the same atrocities in the
southern Sudan. Because of military pressure by
Uganda's armed forces, with the cooperation of the

Government of the Sudan, most of them have been
flushed out of the Sudan and have relocated to
Garamba National Park in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo. They have thus become a regional threat. In
Uganda, they have been defeated. There are a few
remnants on the run, but unless something is done to
arrest and disarm them in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, they may regroup and pose a threat again.

The United Nations, together with the countries
of the region concerned, should act to arrest especially
those who have been indicted by the International
Criminal Court. The rest could be encouraged to take
advantage of the amnesty which is in place in Uganda.
