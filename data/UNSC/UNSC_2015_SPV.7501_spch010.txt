Mr. Wilson (United Kingdom): The United
Kingdom is pleased to have co-sponsored resolution
2235 (2015). We strongly support the establishment of
a Joint Investigative Mechanism into alleged uses of
toxic chemicals as weapons in Syria. This Mechanism
is a vital step forwards. Through our actions today, we
have moved closer to ending impunity and to holding to
account those who have used these barbaric weapons.

The Mechanism we have established today will
be impartial, it will be independent and it will be
comprehensive. It builds logically on past investigations.
It has a clear mandate to identify individuals, entities,
groups or Governments that are perpetrators, organizers
or sponsors ofthe use of chemicals as weapons in Syria.
This includes chlorine and any other toxic chemical.

Launching this impartial Mechanism shows our
commitment to a rules-based international system
where the hard facts will identify those responsible for
these crimes. This is an important step forward, but
there is more to do. We look forward to the Mechanism
starting its work promptly, and we reiterate the Council's
call on all States to cooperate fully with United Nations
investigators, as well as with the Fact-Finding Mission
of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons. They will play a key facilitating role in the
work of the Joint Investigative Mechanism.

In establishing the Mechanism today, we have
demonstrated that the Council can find common
ground; we look forward to building on this in order
to tackle the other challenges we face on Syria, and to
bring an end after so long to the suffering of the Syrian
people.
