Mr. Van Bohemen (New Zealand): New Zealand
welcomes the efforts of Russia, Turkey and others to
reduce the level of fighting in Syria. We also welcome
the efforts of the presidency, Russia and Turkey, and
all other Council members to work for the adoption of
a resolution that all Council members could support.
That is a demonstration of what the Council can do
when we turn our collective minds to achieving a
positive outcome. We are very pleased, therefore, that
the Council could put its weight behind a measure
designed to reduce civilian suffering in Syria and
restart the political process.

As others have said, there are aspects of the
ceasefire and other agreements that must be clarified.
In particular, there are uncertainties about the
participation of opposition groups in the ceasefire and
the Astana talks. The implications for groups that are
not participating should also be clarified. New Zealand
would also welcome greater clarity about humanitarian
access and the role of the United Nations in the Astana
political process. That said, we are pleased that the
Council was able to come together to support this
important development.

New Zealand's term on the Security Council will
end very soon. We hope that further clarity will be
provided and that this agreement will alleviate the
suffering of the Syrian people and help to put Syria on
a path to a lasting and enduring peace. Since this is, I
hope, the last time we will be addressing the Council
during our current term, I would like to conclude by
commending the Spanish presidency for its outstanding
leadership over the past month and by thanking all
our colleagues in the Secretariat for the courtesy and
cooperation they have shown me and my delegation
over the past two years.
