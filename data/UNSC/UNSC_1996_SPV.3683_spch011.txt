Mr. Eitel (Germany): Germany will vote in favour
of the draft resolution on the communication which has
been presented at the request of this Council by the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) on the
incident which occurred on 24 February 1996 and which
led to the shooting down of two United States-based
unarmed civilian aircraft by the Cuban Air Force.

The vote on this draft resolution comes after weeks
of intense discussions and deliberations. All different
aspects of the case have been subject to close scrutiny. In
this context, we would like to commend ICAO for its

 

resolution and its report. The main item at stake is the basic
rule that States must refrain from the use of weapons
against civil aircraft in flight. Let me add, in the light of
what has been explained at some length by the
representative of Cuba, that shooting down unarmed civilian
aircraft - regardless of where this is done: whether it is
done over territorial waters or over the high seas - is a
clear breach of international law - if not codified and
ratified, then of customary international law - which must
not be tolerated.

Let me use this occasion to express our sincere
condolences to the families of those killed in those planes.

We hope that the legal discussion can now come to an
end, and that further violations of this basic rule will not
occur. We would like to see that the recent discussion has
sharpened the conscience and sensibility of those
responsible, and we sincerely hope that this will remain true
in the future.
