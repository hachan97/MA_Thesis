Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): I thank
Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing.

China is deeply concerned and worried about
the continued worsening of the armed conflict in
eastern Ukraine, which has caused great loss of life
and property. In the current situation, all the parties
concerned must exercise restraint so as not to escalate
it further.

China has stated on many occasions its principled
position on the question of Ukraine. On this occasion, I
will refrain from repeating it.

I wish to emphasize the following. The crisis
in Ukraine can be resolved only by political means.
The priority now is for all the parties concerned to
achieve a prompt ceasefire, persevere in efforts to
promote a political resolution of the crisis in Ukraine,
fully accommodate the legitimate rights, interests
and aspirations of all regions and ethnic groups of
Ukraine and take into full consideration the legitimate
concerns of all parties, thereby achieving a balance of
their interests. The international community should
urge the parties concerned to make good use of
various mechanisms for dialogue and liaison, increase
communications and act in a manner that is conducive
to mutual trust.

China supports all efforts that would contribute to
easing the situation, resolving the crisis and promoting
a political solution.
