Mr. Harrison (United Kingdom): Like all other
members of the Council, the United Kingdom strongly
supports the United Nations Organization Mission in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), and
we want to see it deployed. One way in which we can
make sure that MONUC is ready is to hold an early
meeting of Council members and troop contributors to
review the status of MONUC deployment and the
concept of operations. But, as the Secretary-General
has made clear in his report (S/2000/888), the real
problem is that MONUC is unable at present to do its
job. Efforts to get the right conditions in place for
MONUC deployment have so far been unsuccessful.
The situation cannot be allowed to drift further.

The Council is about to agree on a two-month
extension of MONUC's mandate. There must be
progress during that two-month period. It is for the
parties to decide whether they want Lusaka. If they do,
they must apply themselves fully and unreservedly to
its implementation, because, if there is no forward
movement, MONUC's position will be untenable. The
prospects of our losing MONUC are very real. This
would have devastating consequences for the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, for its people and
for the region.

The parties have got to make a decision. They
have to decide whether they want peace or whether
they want to continue with a war that cannot be won.
