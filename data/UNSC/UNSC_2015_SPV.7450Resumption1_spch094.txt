Mr. Omaish (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): I thank
you, Madam, for giving me the floor. We entirely reject
the false allegations and fallacious references made by
today by the representative of the Syrian Arab Republic
about my country. He failed in his attempt to distract
the attention of the international community from the
practices of the Syrian regime against its own people
in all sectors of society. The regime is seeking to
shirk its own ethical and legal responsibilities under
international humanitarian law to protect Syrian
civilians andjournalists and to preventjournalists from
being attacked and targeted.
