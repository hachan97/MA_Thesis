Mr. Cunningham (United States of America): It
is a pleasure to welcome Foreign Minister Kerim to the
Security Council, although I wish it were under slightly
happier circumstances, but it is good to have him here
and to hear his views on the situation in his country
and in the border area.

I will make my remarks brief, because there is
little disagreement in this room about the responsible
and careful way that his Government has handled the
Violence in the northern part of his country, about the
need for it to cease and about the desire for the Council
to provide support for future actions that can help
respond to the problem in a way that is consistent with
the Government's responsibility to the rule of law.

My delegation is encouraged that the
international community is assisting his Government in
managing this problem, and we recognize the important
roles that the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the European
Union are all playing in that regard.

Several days ago members of the Council heard
from NATO Secretary General Robertson, who noted
the difficulty of responding to the problems in the
region and described to us some of NATO's efforts to
help. It is certainly not easy to balance the different and
not always well-grounded or rational perceptions on
the ground with the need to take action as the situation
requires, and as this situation requires.

I understand that Minister Kerim will be
proceeding to Brussels later this week for discussions
at NATO, and I am confident that it will be a
productive visit.

As the Council will make clear in the statement
that the President will read out at the end of this
meeting, there is considerable concern about the
violence that has spilled over into Macedonia, and
there is much support for the efforts of its Government,
with the help of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) and others,
to deal with it. I should like the Foreign Minister to
please take a message back to his Government: that the
Security Council understands the seriousness of the
problem, that it understands the prudence with which
the Government has responded; that it sees the country
as an example of democracy based on the rule of law
and inter-ethnic cooperation; and that the United
Nations will do all it can, in cooperation with other
international organizations, to ensure that these
accomplishments are not undermined.
