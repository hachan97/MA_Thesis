Ms. Wronecka (Poland): Poland voted in favour
of the United States draft resolution on Venezuela
(S/2019/186). We decided to support that draft resolution
as we believe that it is the primary responsibility of the
Security Council to address urgently the worsening
humanitarian crisis affecting millions of Venezuelans.
The crisis has been further exacerbated by the blocking
of the delivery of humanitarian aid by pro-Maduro
security forces. Every day that passes without that aid
is a day with more and more people suffering, including
children, owing to the lack of basic services, food and
medicines. We therefore regret that not all members
of the Council decided to engage in the consultation
process. Another division among Council members
sends a negative message to a place that deserves better.

At the same time, Poland decided to vote against
the Russian draft resolution (S/2019/l90), as it lacked
the basic and most important element of acknowledging
the humanitarian catastrophe. We also reject the notion
that responding to the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela
undermines its sovereignty - quite the contrary. Let
me stress that it is the Council's responsibility and
within its legitimate concern, in line with the Charter
of the United Nations, to address situations that
endanger the maintenance of international peace and
security, such as that taking place in Venezuela right
now. Moreover, we are responding to the calls of the
legitimate authorities in Venezuela.

In conclusion, what really matters is the suffering
of the people of Venezuela. They deserve a better
future. We hope that we will be able to meet their
rightful expectations.
