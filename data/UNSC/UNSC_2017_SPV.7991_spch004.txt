Mr. Ciss (Senegal) (spoke in French): Senegal
welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 2364
(2017), which extends the mandate of the United Nations
Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in
Mali (MINUSMA) until 30 June 2018. My country also
welcomes the adoption by the Government of Mali of
a comprehensive plan to re-establish the presence of
the State in central Mali, and throughout the entire
territory of the country.

It is in that spirit that Senegal welcomes the
mandate renewal of MINUSMA, which reaffirms in
particular support for the Government of Mali and
for the redeployment of Malian armed forces across
the territory, making it possible to bolster security
throughout Mali in general, and in central Mali in
particular, where Senegal, as all are aware, will continue
to be involved through the deployment of its Rapid
Reaction Force. That is one of the newer expressions
of the solidarity of the people and the Government of
Senegal to the brotherly people of Mali, a commitment
proven early on, since the very beginning of the
crisis, by the presence of the Senegalese forces among
African troops.

In conclusion, my country would like to pay
renewed and deserved tribute to MINUSMA and
to all the troop-contributing countries for the great
sacrifices they have made on behalf of the force as
a way of assisting the people of Mali with a view to
re-establishing its sovereignty over the entire territory.
