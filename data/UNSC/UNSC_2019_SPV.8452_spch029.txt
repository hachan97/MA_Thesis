Mr. Abrams (United States of America): I had
not intended to speak, but it seems to me that it is
worthwhile, and indeed necessary, to respond to the
statements made on behalf of the regime in Venezuela.
1 cannot respond to every attack that was made against
every country here, such as the insults that were made
by calling many countries here satellites. In fact, it was
interesting that every single country that the previous
speaker attacked or criticized was a democracy. Every
single one that was criticized was a democracy. It was
just a series of insults that reflects the fact that today
there is a satellite present here, and it is Venezuela,
which, unfortunately, has become a satellite of Cuba
and Russia.

The regime and its spokesman are hiding
behind the laws and Constitution of Venezuela while
imprisoning opponents, preventing free elections and
killing democrats like Fernando Alban. This is not
about foreign intervention in Venezuela. It is not an
attempt to impose a result on the Venezuelan people.
Democracy never needs to be imposed. It is tyranny
that has to be imposed. This discussion in the Security
Council is about the right of the Venezuelan people to
direct their own internal affairs and choose the future
of their own country democratically.
