The President: I thank the Minister of External
Relations of Angola for his kind words addressed to me.
I should like to inform members that I have received
a letter dated 8 February 1995 from the Permanent
Representative of Nigeria to the United Nations. The
letter reads as follows:

"I have the honour to request that during the
meeting of the Security Council devoted to
consideration of the situation in Angola, the Council
extend an invitation, under rule 39 of the provisional
rules of procedure, to His Excellency Dr. Salim
Ahmed Salim, Secretary General of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU)."

This letter will be published as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/1995/ 123.

If I hear no objection I shall take it that the Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 to His
Excellency Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The next speaker is the Minister of External Affairs
of Malawi, His Excellency Mr. E. C. I. Bwanali. I
welcome His Excellency and invite him to take a place at
the Council table and to make his statement.
