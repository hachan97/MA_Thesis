Mrs. Van Vlierberge (Belgium) (spoke in French):
At the outset allow me to express my country's deepest
condolences to the Government of New Zealand and
to the families of the victims following the terrorist
incident in Christchurch yesterday.

Today Belgium voted in favour of resolution 2460
(2019) renewing the mandate of the United Nations
Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). We did
so because the resolution ensures that UNAMA can
continue to provide valuable support to the Afghan
authorities at a crucial time in the peace process
and in strengthening democracy in the country. We
welcome the efforts made by the co-penholders to find
a common understanding. However, we regret the fact
that the Council was not able to reach consensus on a
more detailed resolution, thereby depriving the Mission
of the necessary political guidance.

As my German colleague eloquently said, a
one-year mandate would have allowed the Mission to
have better operational planning and more prospects.
Renewing the mandate in September will give us the
opportunity to rectify that.
