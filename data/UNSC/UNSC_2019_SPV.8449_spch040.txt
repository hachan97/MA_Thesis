President Abbas reminded us in February 2018: "If
justice for all people cannot be attained here, where
should we go?" (S/PV8183, p.10)

We should not fail the Palestinian people, for what
is at stake is the credibility of the Organization and
the fundamental tenets of the Charter of the United
Nations, based on the inherent dignity of the individual
and respect for the fundamental human rights of all,
including the right to self-determination.
