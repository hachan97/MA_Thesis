Mr. Power (United Kingdom): Obviously, again
and as we have often said in the Council, there are far
too many inaccuracies in the Syrian representative's
statement to go into any detail, but since he mentioned
us I wanted to speak in reply to remind him that we were
given the floor to speak on a point of order yesterday
(see S/PV.8561) to object to his persistent naming of
humanitarian workers as terrorists, which we find
disrespectful to the Council. Furthermore, I would
point out that the length of his intervention and remarks
today further undermine his disrespect for the Council.

The meeting rose at 12.40 pm.
