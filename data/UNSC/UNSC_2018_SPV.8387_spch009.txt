Mr. Lewicki (Poland): Poland voted in favour of
resolution 2440 (2018) and regrets that the Council
was unable to reach consensus on it. We supported the
resolution because we believe that it is the Security
Council's responsibility to assist the parties in achieving
ajust, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution
to this long-standing dispute, based on compromise and
in accordance with the purposes and principles of the
Charter of the United Nations.

Poland appreciates the important role played by the
United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara (MINURSO) on the ground and the need for
it to fully implement its mandate, including its role in
helping the Personal Envoy reach a mutually acceptable
political solution. We believe that the resolution adopted
today by the Security Council is an important step in
advancing that process. In that context, we welcome
the extension of MINURSO's mandate for another six
months. We also wish to thank the United States as
penholder for its efforts during the negotiations.

In conclusion, let me assure you, Mr. President,
of Poland's continued support for the mission of the
Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Western
Sahara, Horst Kohler.
