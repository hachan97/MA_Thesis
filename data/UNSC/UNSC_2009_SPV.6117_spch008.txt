Mr. Tiendrebeogo (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French): Burkina Faso welcomes the adoption by this
Council of resolution 1871 (2009), a resolution that
extends the mandate of the United Nations Mission for
the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO),
whose actions we unreservedly support. When on
22 April the Council considered the issue of Western
Sahara, my delegation expressed concern at the slow
pace of the negotiations between the parties. At the
same time, we noted our appreciation of the planned
approach proposed by Christopher Ross, the new
Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General - and we of
course wish him every success in his mission - to
breathe new life into the process. We felt reassured by
his remarks insofar as, after a visit to the region, he
spoke of the adherence of the parties to this approach.

The importance of MINURSO and the necessity
for the United Nations, and the Secretary-General in
particular, to ensure assistance for the parties during
the negotiations process are clear to all. We believe at
this stage that, in addition to the extension of the
mission's mandate, the Security Council should pursue
clear objectives, namely, to spare no effort to promote
the rapid resumption of the Manhasset negotiations
process and to fully support the new Personal Envoy of
the Secretary-General.

We believe that all of these objectives have found
expression in the new resolution that we have just
adopted, and that is why we supported it. Indeed, we
believe that this draft is the best possible compromise
at present. We thank the delegation of the United States
and all co-sponsors for their efforts, which have
enabled the Council to speak with a single voice this
afternoon.
