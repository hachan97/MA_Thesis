Ms. Loj (Denmark): It has been two months since
the Security Council received the report of the
International Commission of Inquiry regarding the
ongoing atrocities in Darfur. The report strongly
recommended the referral of the crimes in Darfur to the
International Criminal Court (ICC). Throughout the
Council's long negotiation process, Denmark has
supported that recommendation. The ICC has the
mandate, the capacity and the funding necessary to
ensure swift and cost-effective prosecution. From that
perspective, we are indeed very encouraged that the
Council has just adopted a resolution that will bring an
internationally recognized follow-up to the reported
crimes in Darfur. Any further postponement of this
issue would only have weakened confidence in the
resolve of the Council.

Denmark recognizes the difficulties that some
members have in accepting the compromise text before
us. We appreciate the flexibility shown by all parties.
Furthermore, Denmark was able to vote in favour of
the resolution only after careful consideration of some
of the formulations in the text. With regard to the
language on exclusive jurisdiction, it is our
interpretation that it does not affect the universal
jurisdiction of Member States in areas such as war
crimes, torture and terrorism. As regards the
formulation regarding the existence of the agreements
referred to in article 98, paragraph 2, of the Rome
Statute, Denmark would like to stress that that
reference is purely factual; it is merely referring to the
existence of such agreements. Thus, the reference in no
way impinges on the integrity of the Rome Statute.

That having been said, we believe that the
resolution is a genuine and valid compromise leading
to the very first referral of a situation to the ICC by the
Security Council. Denmark thus looks forward to
seeing the Court take the first important steps towards
ending the culture of impunity in Darfur.
