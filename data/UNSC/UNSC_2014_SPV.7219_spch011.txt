Mr. Araud (France) (spoke in French): I thank
Mr. Feltman for his briefing.

I wish to extend my deepest condolences to all the
Permanent Representatives of the countries that lost
citizens in this tragic event. I would like in particular
to extend our condolences to our colleagues from the
Netherlands and Malaysia. We also mourn with the
people of the Netherlands.

Yesterday a Malaysia Airlines flight with nearly 300
passengers aboard crashed in the separatist-controlled
area of Ukraine, and the French President expressed his
enormous sorrow at the announcement of the disaster.
Today I reiterate France's solidarity with the victims'
families in the ordeal they are experiencing.

Given this tragedy and the already chaotic situation,
France requests that all efforts be brought forth to
shed light on the circumstances that led to the tragedy.
We call for an independent international inquiry that
would allow the facts to be established and to draw the
necessary conclusions.

We ask that all measures be taken to facilitate the
work of the investigators on the ground. In particular,
we expect the separatists to cooperate with the
Ukrainian authorities in the investigation and to allow
safe, immediate and full access to the investigators, in
accordance with the decision made yesterday during
the video tele-conference between the contact group
involving Ukraine, Russia and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the
separatist representatives.

A glimmer of hope had begun to dawn in
Ukraine at the end of last month. With the election of
Mr. Poroshenko, a process of political normalization
had begun. A unilateral ceasefire, declared by Kiev
on 20 June, hinted at a possible end to the general
deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in the
east. On that same day, President Poroshenko initiated
a comprehensive peace plan in order to arrive at a
peaceful resolution of the situation.

Furthermore, following their meeting on the
sidelines of the ceremonies marking the Normandy
landing, a process of almost daily exchanges between
Presidents Poroshenko and Putin and Chancellor Merkel
and President Hollande led to the start of a useful
dialogue. Moreover, a joint statement was adopted
in Berlin on 2 July that provided for the quest of a
lasting ceasefire via the meeting between the contact
group and the separatists, strengthened border control
on the Russian-Ukrainian border to curb the flow of
weapons and fighters, and the agreement of the OSCE
to participate in that effort.

Nevertheless, today the situation continues to
deteriorate. For several days, fighting has escalated in
eastern Ukraine because the separatists have refused to
clasp the hand being extended to them. Every day the
attacks are ever more deadly. Weapons never used until
now have begun to be used and have struck Ukrainian
territory. Two Ukrainian planes were shot down in their
own airspace. That could happen only if one of the
parties possessed sophisticated anti-aircraft weaponry.
Moreover, this unprecedented deterioration is also due
to the presence of armed fighters coming from outside
Ukraine. The question of outside support in terms of
recruitment, supplies of materials and training cannot
be avoided. The answer is too obvious. It is irrefutable.

Weapon systems with significant firepower are
being used, which can lead to tragic blunders. Those
who are responsible for arming those who use those
weapons bear the responsibility for this conflagration.
As I said in an earlier statement, when bandits are given
weapons we cannot be surprised that they behave like
bandits.

All those events point to the pressing need for
full cooperation by the international community in
order to stabilize Ukraine and ensure its sovereignty
and territorial integrity. We also call for a sincere
commitment from Russia, one that so far has been
lacking. The day before yesterday, the Heads of State
and Government of the European Union acknowledged
that the many appeals made to Moscow to end its
non-cooperative stance had not been heard. That is the
reason for the European Union's decision to impose
tougher sanctions.

However, the strengthening of those sanctions has
one and the same goal: to facilitate the emergence of
a political solution. Our priority remains, first, to end
the escalation and establish a lasting ceasefire that is
respected by all parties. That is why we call on Russia
to engage constructively in that endeavour and to bring
its influence to bear on the illegal armed groups to lay
down their arms and engage in dialogue.

Separatist activity must end. In order to slow down
the flow of weapons and fighters that cross through the
Russian-Ukrainian border on a daily basis, we call for
negotiations between Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE
in order to allow the rapid deployment of a monitoring
mission at the border.

Let this tragedy at least serve as a warning to
all the parties. Once the bullets have been shot, they
strike indiscriminately and escape all control. We have
reached such moment. It should still be possible to
avoid the worst.
