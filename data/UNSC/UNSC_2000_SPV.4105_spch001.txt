The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in which they request to
be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Sacirbey
(Bosnia and Herzegovina) and Mr. Calovski (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) took the
seats reserved for them at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The President (spoke in Spanish): In accordance with
the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall take
it that the Security Council agrees to extend an invitation
under rule 39 of the its provisional rules of procedure to
Mr. Carl Bildt, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for
the Balkans.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
I invite Mr. Bildt to take a seat at the Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Carl Bildt, Special Envoy of the Secretary-
General to the Balkans. Following his briefing, the
members of the Council will have an opportunity to
comment and to ask questions.

I now call on Mr. Bildt.
