The United Kingdom thanks the German and Belgian delegations for their unstinting and principled efforts to ensure that the United Nations and its humanitarian partners have what they have repeatedly told the Council they require in order to meet the needs of millions of people in Syria. The United Kingdom remains committed to ensuring that aid in Syria reaches those who need it. We support strongly the text in the draft resolution to extend for a period of 12 months the two border crossings in north-western Syria. Millions of lives depend on this. We therefore deeply regret that Russia and China have used their veto. In so doing, Russia and China have again put political calculations above the needs of the Syrian people and so politicized this humanitarian issue. Today the Council has been unable to fulfil its responsibility to ensure that the humanitarian needs of millions of Syrians, the majority of them women and children, are met. The United Kingdom will continue to support the penholders to find a way through.
