Mr. Cohen (United States of America): Today's
vote on resolution 2461 (2019), supporting the United
Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM),
underscores the strong and continued commitment
of the international community to supporting peace,
stability and development in Somalia. UNSOM
remains a critical partner to the Federal Government
of Somalia and the federal member states in bringing
about political, security and economic stability to the
Horn of Africa region.

We appreciate the efforts of the penholder in
renewing this mandate. The United States believes
that an UNSOM. mandate that precisely delineates the
United Nations roles and responsibilities and that avoids
language unrelated to the United Nations Mission is
needed in order to foster a clear understanding among
all partners of the Security Council's expectations
in Somalia.

However, given the context of the resolution and
the United Nations activities in Somalia, we believe
that the fifteenth preambular paragraph and operative
paragraph 21 should focus specifically on assessing
risks and developing risk-management strategies related
to the impacts of drought, desertification and food and
water scarcity, rather than on any particular potential
cause of those impacts, such as climate change.

The United States supports the inclusion of
language in the UNSOM. resolution that highlights
the adverse effects of specific natural disasters on the
stability of Somalia. Droughts, desertification, land
degradation, food insecurity and ecological changes can
all negatively impact the stability of any nation. We can
and should ask the United Nations and Governments to
consider those implications as part of their planning.
We support the work of the United Nations to undertake
risk assessment and risk management strategies, and
the Security Council's role in addressing specific
challenges such as droughts, desertification, land
degradation, food insecurity and ecological changes.
