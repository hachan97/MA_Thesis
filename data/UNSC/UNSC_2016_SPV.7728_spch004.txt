Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
appreciates the commitment of the Government of the
Sudan to the promotion of national dialogue, peace
and stability in the Darfur region and its economic
development, and to the successful organization of the
referendum in Darfur. China welcomes the mediation
efforts of the African Union High-level Implementation
Panel and the signing by the Government of the Sudan
of the road map agreement proposed by the Panel.
The international community should urge the relevant
armed groups and opposition to expeditiously sign the
road map agreement and participate in the national
dialogue and the implementation of the Doha Document
for Peace in Darfur in order to achieve a comprehensive
political settlement of the Darfur question.

China appreciates the work of the African
Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur
(UNAMID) to promote the political process in Darfur,
mediate and resolve intercommunal conflicts, and
assist in delivering humanitarian relief. United Nations
peacekeeping operations should effectively respect
the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of host
countries, heed the opinion of host countries and adjust
the scale and mandate of operations in a timely manner,
in keeping with the changes in local circumstances
and needs. China welcomes the work of the Sudanese
Government to assist UNAMID in implementing its
mandate. We hope that the Secretariat, the African
Union and the Sudanese Government will continue
to take advantage of the tripartite mechanism and the
platform of the Joint Working Group to strengthen
communications and consultation, duly address any
problems that emerge during the course of cooperation,
and strive to formulate a practical and reasonable exit
strategy for the Mission as soon as possible.
