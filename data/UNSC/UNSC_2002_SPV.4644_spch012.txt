Mr. Kolby (Norway): Norway voted in favour of
the resolution on Iraq.

This resolution is the result of a long and intense
period of negotiations and deliberations. Great efforts
have been made to make sure that it takes into due
account all concerns of the international community in
stating very clearly and precisely what is required of
Iraq.

Bearing in mind our overall objective of
disarming Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, we
afford Iraq a final opportunity to comply with its
disarmament obligations; we enhance the system of
inspections in such a way as to make it more credible
and effective; and finally, we commit ourselves to
using the Security Council to resolve a serious crisis
and thus signal our determination to uphold the
authority of the Organization and respect for
international law.

Norway wants the conflict with Iraq to be
resolved peacefully. This resolution sets out very
clearly that the Iraqi authorities have a choice. In case
of Iraqi non-compliance, the resolution sets out a
procedure whereby the Security Council will convene
immediately in order to secure international peace and
security. We hope Iraq will choose to fully cooperate
with the United Nations.
