Allow me at the outset to congratulate you, Mr. President, on assuming the presidency of the Security Council for this month. I wish you and your friendly delegation every success. I also wish to extend my sincerest wishes of good health and well-being to all Council members in these challenging times. This war waged by the Houthis has never been a choice for the Yemeni people, who long for peace and stability. The Yemeni Government has tried to avoid war and achieve peace in various ways, including by making successive concessions and responding in good faith to the calls of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and his Special Envoy, as well as to the initiative by the Coalition to Support Legitimacy in Yemen. In addition, the Government of Yemen has welcomed the press statement of the Security Council (SC/14159) calling for a ceasefire on all fronts, uniting efforts and mobilizing resources to combat the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has overwhelmed the world and intensified the suffering of humankind. The Government of Yemen reiterates its willingness to constructively and effectively engage with all genuine calls for comprehensive and sustainable peace in Yemen in accordance with the three agreed terms of reference, namely, the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative and its Implementation Mechanism, the outcome of the comprehensive National Dialogue Conference and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, primarily resolution 2216 (2015), in order to build a better future free of armed militias, regionalism and the divine right to rule and establish a fair, democratic and civil federal State that lives up to the aspirations of all Yemeni people. The Government of Yemen has responded to and engaged positively and flexibly with the recent proposals of Special Envoy Martin Griffiths for a comprehensive ceasefire, the implementation of economic and humanitarian measures and the resumption of the political process. However, as the Special Envoy's efforts have been undermined by Houthi intransigence reflected in their rejection of these proposals, we appeal to the international community and the Security Council to exert pressure on the Houthi militias to comply with the calls for a ceasefire, de-escalation and an end to their absurd war on the Yemeni people. Unfortunately, and as is their custom, the Houthi militias have escalated their military operations at multiple frontlines, launched ballistic missiles on civilian neighbourhoods and residential areas in the city of Ma'rib, abused the Yemeni Government's adherence to de-escalation, killed a female Yemeni citizen after storming her house in Al-Bayda governorate, and committed the most heinous violations, including torture, sexual violence and rape against Yemeni female detainees in Houthi prisons. The latter acts have been perpetrated in flagrant violation of Yemeni norms, values and traditions, as well as the rules of the international humanitarian law and human rights law. It is high time that the international community realize how these militias are engaging with the current and all earlier truces and understand that the Houthi militias are merely an instrument in service of the agenda of Tehran, at the expense of Yemeni lives. The Government of Yemen has made every effort to implement the Riyadh agreement and remains willing to do so today despite the intransigence of the Southern Transitional Council and its so-called declaration of self-administration, which is a reckless step that constitutes a clear rejection of the provisions of the Riyadh agreement and a continuation of the armed rebellion of August last year. Besides the Southern Transitional Council's refusal to comply with the calls by and statements of the Saudi-led coalition, numerous brotherly and friendly States, the international community and the Security Council demanding that the Southern Transitional Council cease the reckless actions that impede the implementation of the Riyadh agreement and affect all efforts to achieve sustainable peace in Yemen, it continued to undermine the security and stability in Socotra governorate and more recently carried out provocative military mobilizations in Abyan. The Government of Yemen stresses the need for the Southern Transitional Council to comply with all calls to withdraw its unconstitutional declaration, return to implementing the Riyadh agreement and its provisions in accordance with the agreed implementation matrix, immediately cease all measures and practices that could disrupt and undermine the work of State institutions or otherwise interfere in the State's performance of its functions, relinquish control of State assets and resources in the interim capital Aden, and stop disrupting the work of Ministry of Health teams tasked with combating the COVID-19 pandemic, especially as the situation in Aden governorate worsens owing to the recent natural disaster and the surge in the number of confirmed coronavirus disease cases. In coordination with the local authorities of the liberated governorates, the Supreme National Emergency Committee for COVID-19 is intensifying its preventive and treatment efforts and is continuously coordinating with Yemen's partner States and international organizations to ensure increased support in this area. Further, the Supreme National Emergency Committee has warned that the continuous manipulation of and tampering with the coronavirus pandemic issue by the Houthi militias, their adoption of a policy of obfuscation and the lack of transparency as to the actual number of cases hinder the efforts to combat the pandemic and put the lives of millions of Yemenis at risk. We call on the World Health Organization to urgently intervene and pressure the militias to share health information and transparently declare the actual number of cases in order to prevent an approaching disaster and preserve millions of civilian lives. Moreover, we invite brotherly and friendly countries and international organizations to provide urgent medical assistance and support in order to save civilian lives so that those who are infected may receive adequate health care, early testing on a large scale is undertaken, and health workers are properly equipped with standard personal protective equipment and the necessary medical devices and ventilators for combating and containing the spread of the pandemic, especially in the light of the fragility of the health sector in Yemen. I must not fail to mention and thank the brotherly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for organizing and hosting the 2020 donors conference for Yemen on 2 June, with the participation of the United Nations. The Government of Yemen calls on the international community and donor countries to take the initiative to effectively contribute to the financing of relief, humanitarian and development response programmes in the country and support the efforts aimed at making this donors conference a success. In conclusion, the Houthi militias continue to deny the United Nations technical team access to the floating oil tanker FSO SAFER in Ras Issa. The Government holds these militias fully responsible for the repercussions of an oil spill, including the potential environmental and economic impacts if the tanker situation remains unresolved. We call on the international community and the Security Council to shoulder their responsibility and pressure the Houthi militias into responding to United Nations efforts and taking the measures necessary to avoid an environmental disaster in the Red Sea.
