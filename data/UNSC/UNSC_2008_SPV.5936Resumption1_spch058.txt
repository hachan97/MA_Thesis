The President: After consultations among
members of the Security Council, I have been
authorized to make the following statement on behalf
of the Council.

"The Security Council reiterates its
commitment to address the widespread impact of
armed conflict on children and its determination
to ensure respect for and implementation of its
resolution 1612 (2005) and all its previous
resolutions on children and armed conflict, and
the Statements of its President on 24 July 2006
(S/PRST/2006/33), 28 November 2006
(S/PRST/2006/48), and 12 February 2008
(S/PRST/2008/6), which provide a
comprehensive framework for addressing the
protection of children affected by armed conflict,
as well as the provisions on children contained in
other resolutions, including resolutions 1325
(2000), 1674 (2006) and 1820 (2008).

"The Security Council reiterates its strong
and equal condemnation of the continuing
recruitment and use of children in armed conflict
in violation of applicable international law,
killing and maiming of children, rape and other
sexual violence, abductions, denial of
humanitarian access to children and attacks
against schools and hospitals by parties to armed
conflict, while acknowledging that the
implementation of its resolution 1612 (2005) has
already generated progress, resulting in the
release and reintegration of children in their
families and communities, through, inter alia, a
more systematic dialogue between the United
Nations country task forces and parties to the
armed conflict on the implementation of time-
bound action plans.

"The Security Council reaffirms the need
for States parties to comply with their obligations
under the Convention on the Rights of the Child
and the Optional Protocols thereto, for armed
groups distinct from the State to refrain from
recruiting or using children in hostilities, and
urges States that have not yet done so to consider
ratifying or acceding to those instruments.

"The Security Council welcomes the
ongoing implementation of the monitoring and
reporting mechanism on children and armed
conflict, in particular the efforts that have made
possible the implementation of the mechanism in
all situations listed in the annexes to the latest
Secretary-General's report (S/2007/757), and
invites the Secretary-General, where applicable,
to bring the mechanism to its full efficiency, in
accordance with resolution 1612 (2005).

"The Security Council welcomes the
sustained activity of its Working Group on
children and armed conflict, as outlined inter alia
in the latest report by its Chair (S/2008/455), and
as the monitoring and reporting mechanism is
being implemented in a growing number of
situations of armed conflict, requests the
Secretary-General to provide additional
administrative support in order for the Working
Group to continue to fully carry out its mandate
in an effective manner.

"The Security Council invites its Working
Group on Children and Armed Conflict to
continue adopting conclusions providing clear
guidance to the parties to armed conflict and
relevant international actors on the concrete steps
that need to be taken in order to respect their
obligations under international law, in particular
Security Council resolutions on children and
armed conflict, and proposing effective
recommendations based on timely, objective,
accurate and reliable information, to the Council
with a view to promoting the protection of
children affected by armed conflict, including

through appropriate mandates of United Nations
peacekeeping operations and political missions.
The Security Council welcomes the efforts by its
Working Group to improve its working methods
and encourages it to continue to do so with a
view to further improving its transparency and
efficiency.

"The Security Council commends the work
carried out by the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General for Children and Armed
Conflict, Ms. Radhika Coomaraswamy, and
underlines the importance of her country visits in
facilitating better coordination among United
Nations partners at the field level, promoting
collaboration between the United Nations and
Governments, enhancing dialogue with parties to
conflicts in implementing applicable international
law, including their obligations under Security
Council resolution 1612 (2005), and thereby
securing concrete child protection commitments.

"The Security Council also commends the
work carried out by UNICEF, as well as other
relevant United Nations agencies, funds and
programmes, within their respective mandates,
the child protection advisers of peacekeeping
operations and political missions in cooperation
with national Governments and relevant civil
society actors, in enhancing the activities of the
United Nations Country Task Forces on
Monitoring and Reporting and promoting child
protection at the field level, including through
implementation of Security Council resolution
1612 (2005) and following up on the relevant
conclusions of the Security Council Working
Group on Children and Armed Conflict.

"The Security Council recognizes the
important role of education in armed conflict
areas as a means to achieve the goal of halting
and preventing recruitment and re-recruitment of
children and calls upon all parties concerned to
continue to ensure that all children associated
with armed forces and groups, as well as issues
related to children, are systematically included in
every disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration process, with a particular emphasis
on education.

"The Security Council reiterates the need

for stronger focus by all parties concerned,
including Governments and the donor
community, on the long-term effects of armed
conflict on children and the impediments to their
full rehabilitation and reintegration into their
families and communities, through, inter alia,
addressing the need for providing appropriate
health care, enhancing their exchange of
information about programmes and best practices,
and ensuring the availability of adequate
resources, funding and technical assistance to
support national strategies or action plans in the
area of child protection and welfare, and
community-based programmes, bearing in mind
the Paris Principles to Protect Children from
Unlawful Recruitment by Armed Forces or
Groups, with a view to ensuring the long-term
sustainability and success of their programmatic
response to the release, rehabilitation and
reintegration of all children associated with
armed forces and armed groups.

next report of the Secretary-General on children
and armed conflict, and reiterates its readiness to
continue to review the relevant provisions of its
resolutions on children and armed conflict,
building on the provisions of resolution 1612
(2005), with a view to further enhancing the
comprehensive framework of the protection of
children in armed conflict."
