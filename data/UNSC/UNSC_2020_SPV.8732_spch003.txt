Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I am very pleased that resolution 2511 (2020) has been adopted, but disappointed that two members of the Council wanted to abstain when we have previously been able to have united agreement on Yemen. I am particularly disappointed that this took place after extensive negotiations this morning, reopening the blue draft. However, I want to pay tribute to you, Sir, and to our French colleagues for their help in getting us to a text that we had thought everybody could accept. I would like to put down a marker about a wider issue. There is a risk that the veto will become simply a negotiating tactic. If countries are going to engage in negotiations with us in detail and then not support the text, that in my mind is sharp practice. There is a risk to the Security Council in that sort of behaviour. There is a risk that it will not be able to step up to its responsibilities. I say again, for the record, texts cannot always be consensual unless we are prepared to accept the blandest, lowest-common-denominator text possible. If we do that then, again, we are not discharging our responsibility. Other colleagues around the table have compromised. We compromise on our ideal text when we engage in these negotiations in the interests of having the Security Council speak authoritatively. I therefore hope that this does not herald a shift in the way the Security Council does business. Again, for the record, even though two members did not vote for the resolution, it has been adopted and it therefore comes into force.
