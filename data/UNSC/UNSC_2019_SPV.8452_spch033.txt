Mr. Arreaza (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): With regard to what Mr. Elliott
Abrams said, it is sometimes difficult for some
spokespersons to speak with moral authority, especially
in view of their background and track records. We
respect the ability he has demonstrated in negotiating
many difficult cases, but he was tried and pardoned for
this very type of intervention in Latin America - for
the Iran-Contra incident and for collaboration with
dictators such as Rios Montt. In other words, perhaps,
such words would be more fitting for a spokesperson
from another generation.

In any case, insults are levelled at Venezuela
daily, including the words "dictatorship", "regime",
"torture", "murderer", "corrupt", "drug trafficker". For
God's sake, why hurl such insults? These are standing
insults against Venezuela. Fortunately, the Federal
Government of the United States has reopened, as I
believe it has nothing better to do but focus its attention
on Venezuela. We can be thankful that its Government

has reopened as it will have more work to do.

Mr. Pompeo, who did not want to stay for our
statement. It is a pity that he left, as we have made
clear here - and as President Maduro has also made
clear - our intention to establish and maintain open
communication and dialogue with the Government of
President Trump. That is what we have tried to do since
the first day Commander Chavez came to power, on
2 February 1999, and since President Nicolas Maduro
has been in power. What we have received in response to
our offers of dialogue has been blockades, persecution,
sanctions, violence, aggression, insults, interventions
and now this coup d'etat. However, the channel remains
open so that we can conduct dialogue and treat each
other in a civilized way, as indicated in the Charter of
the United Nations, which we all have to respect.
