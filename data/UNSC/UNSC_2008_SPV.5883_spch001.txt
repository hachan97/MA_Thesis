The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/226, which contains the special
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE).

Following consultations among the members of
the Security Council, I have been authorized to make
the following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council notes that the
continuation of Eritrea's obstructions towards
UNMEE has reached a level so as to undermine
the basis of the Mission's mandate and has
compelled UNMEE to temporarily relocate. The
Security Council recalls its previous
condemnation of Eritrea's lack of cooperation.
"The Security Council notes the underlying
fundamental issues and stands ready to assist the
parties to overcome the current stalemate, taking
into account the interests and concerns of both
parties.

"The Security Council will, in the light of
consultations with the parties, decide on the terms
of a future United Nations engagement and on the
future of UNMEE.

"The Security Council stresses, in
accordance with its repeated statements, that the
primary responsibility for achieving a
comprehensive and lasting settlement of the
border dispute and normalizing their relations
rests with the parties themselves.

"The Security Council urges both sides to
show maximum restraint and to refrain from any
threat or use of force against each other and calls
upon the parties to address forthwith the
unresolved issues in accordance with the
commitments made in the Algiers Agreements."

This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under symbol S/PRST/2008/12.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 9.25 pm.
