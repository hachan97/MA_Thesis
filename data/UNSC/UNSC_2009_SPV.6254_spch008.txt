Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): The
United Kingdom voted today in favour of resolution
1907 (2009), creating a new United Nations sanctions
regime on Eritrea in response to its continued violation
of Security Council resolutions on Somalia and
Djibouti. The resolution follows a specific request by
two regional organizations - the African Union and
the Intergovernmental Authority on Development - for
the Security Council to take such action. The
Monitoring Group on Somalia has presented evidence
to the Council that Eritrea is supporting armed
opposition groups in Somalia, in violation of Security
Council resolution 1844 (2008). Eritrea has also failed
to comply with any of the measures in Security
Council resolution 1862 (2009), adopted in January
this year in response to the border skirmish between
Djibouti and Eritrea.

We would like to pay tribute to the hard work that
the Ugandan delegation, whose troops are in harm's
way in Somalia, has put in to achieve this resolution.

The United Kingdom urges the Eritrean
Government to stop its illegal actions following the
adoption of this Security Council resolution and to
engage constructively with international partners to
help increase stability in the Horn of Africa. The nature
of the international community's engagement with
Eritrea in future will depend on that response.
