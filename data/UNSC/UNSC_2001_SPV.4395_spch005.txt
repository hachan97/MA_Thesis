The President: I thank the Minister of Foreign
Affairs and International Cooperation of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo for his kind words
addressed to me.

May I, on behalf of all present, extend a warm
welcome to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has
kindly joined our deliberations on the very important
issue before us today.

I should like to inform the Council that I have
received a letter from the representative of Zimbabwe,
in which he requests to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the discussion, without the right to vote,
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Jokonya

(Zimbabwe) took the seat reservedfor him at the

side ofthe Council Chamber.

The President: I will now open the floor to
members of the Security Council. The first speaker
inscribed on my list is Ambassador Levitte.
