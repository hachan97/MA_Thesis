Mr. Zhang Dianbin (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
thank Ms. Bensouda for her briefing.

The conflict in Libya has been raging for more
than eight years, wreaking havoc on the country and its
neighbours, bringing enormous suffering to the Libyan
people and threatening international peace and security.
China has always believed that the issue of Libya must
be resolved through a political process. We hope that
all parties to the conflict will focus on the interests of
the country and the people, achieve a ceasefire as soon
as possible, ease tensions, return to political dialogue
and consultations, and actively promote the process
of reaching a political settlement in Libya. China
supports all efforts that will help stabilize the situation
in the country and promote a political solution to the
Libyan issue.

In late July, Mr. Ghassan Salame, the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General for Libya,
proposed a three-point plan, which provides ideas for
resolving the Libyan crisis. The international community
should play a constructive role in implementing the
relevant recommendations. China supports a Libyan-
owned and Libyan-lad political-settlement process
and encourages Special Representative Salame and
such regional organizations as the African Union and
the League of Arab States to continue their mediation
efforts and form synergies.

While respecting Libya's independence, unity,
sovereignty and territorial integrity, the international
community should continue to provide support for and
assistance to Libya so that the country achieves peace,
stability and development as soon as possible. China's
position with regard to the International Criminal Court
remains unchanged.
