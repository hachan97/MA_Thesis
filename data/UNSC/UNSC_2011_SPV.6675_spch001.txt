The President (spoke in Russian): Under rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite
the representative of Iraq to participate in this meeting.

Under rule 39 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure, I invite Mr. Martin Kobler, Special
Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of
the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq, to
participate in this meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2011/736, which contains the first
report of the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 6
of resolution 2001 (2011).

I now give the floor to Mr. Kobler. Since this is
Mr. Kobler's first appearance before the Security
Council, I should like to extend him a particularly
warm welcome and wish him success in his work.
