Mr. Delattre (France) (spoke in French): After
having vetoed a draft resolution that sought to shed
full light on acts of violence involving chemical
weapons (S/2018/175), including those that took
place last weekend, Russia persists in a dual strategy
of obstruction and diversion on the matter. The only
aim of the draft text on which we have just voted
(S/2018/322) was clearly to confuse the issue. It is
not a question of disputing the importance of an
independent investigation by the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) into what
happened in Douma on 7 April. That is essential, and
the investigation has already been launched.

However, the Russian draft resolution, which
we had to vote against, did not meet the challenges.
Let us be clear: what we lack today, and what Russia
continues to reject, is a truly independent and impartial
mechanism that can attribute responsibility in order
to prevent impunity. That was the raison d'etre for the
OPCW-United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism.
With the establishment of the Joint Investigative
Mechanism, set up with the involvement of Russia,
we put in place a tool for the essential deterrence of
perpetrators of chemical attacks. That is clearly what
we lack today.

Let us be clear in saying that statements are not
enough and that the Russian draft resolution is only a
smokescreen that falls well short of the urgent response
that the Council should provide. That is why France
voted against the draft resolution and why the draft
resolution was not adopted.

Today I reiterate that France will spare no effort to
ensure that the perpetrators of those chemical horrors
are identified and held to account in an independent
and impartial way. The stakes are extremely high, and
we will not give up.
