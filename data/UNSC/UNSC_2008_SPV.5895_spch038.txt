The President: I think that is a very good note on
which to conclude the morning session. I am extremely
grateful to all those who have contributed so far, many
of whom have come from a very long distance. There
are 30 speakers this afternoon to take the debate
forward.

I am reminded of the quotation from our Spanish
colleague: If the first condition of peace is the will to
achieve it, then I think that this morning's debate has
helped to show genuine will, and I look forward to it
being taken forward.

The meeting was suspended at 1.05 pm.
