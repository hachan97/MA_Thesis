Mr. Alotaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I would
like to thank you, Mr. President, for reading out
presidential statement S/PRST/2019/l, whose adoption
by the Security Council we welcome. We would like
to thank all Council members for their support for
the statement.

The adoption of the presidential statement today
on the issues of detainees, missing nationals and the
repatriation of property comes as an assurance that
those issues, including of course the national archive,
are pending and remaining commitments under relevant
Security Council resolutions. We understand that those
issues have nothing to do with international peace and
security. However, they are humanitarian issues in
nature and are reminders of the Iraqi aggression against
Kuwait in 1990 - issues that are not over yet.

We are of the view that today's presidential statement
actually sends important messages to all the parties
concerned, including the United Nations Assistance
Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) and the International
Committee of the Red Cross. The statement embodies
the support of the Security Council for all the
endeavours made by those entities, and the Council
stresses that these issues, namely, the detainees, the
missing nationals and the Kuwaiti property, are at the
heart of the UNAMI mandate, pursuant to resolution
2107 (2013).
In addition, the presidential statement sends
messages to Iraq, namely, that the Security Council
appreciates and values the efforts made by the Iraqi
Government, through its Ministry of Defence, to
search for detainees and missing nationals so as to
know their fate. It also sends an important message
to Kuwait, specifically to the families of the missing
nationals, who do not know the fate of their loved ones,
namely, that the Security Council is interested in this
issue and follows up on it, as it is still on the agenda of
the Council.

The meeting rose at 10.15 am.
