Mr. Rosselli (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): At
the outset, I should like to congratulate Angola on
assuming the presidency ofthe Council in March. I also
wish to thank our dear friend Raphael and the entire
Venezuelan delegation for their excellent leadership of
the Council during the month of February.

Uruguay co-sponsored resolution 2270 (2016)
and welcomes its unanimous adoption. I should like
to make a general comment using the Toledo formula
that our friend Mr. Roman Oyarzun Marchesi urges
us to use. As such, I will not repeat all that has been
said by other members with regard to the failure of
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to honour
its international obligations or some of the comments
made by other colleagues with regard to the aims and
content of the resolution.

I will limit myself simply to saying that my
delegation's support for the resolution is based on our
conviction that the implementation of new sanctions
will not cause direct harm to the civilian population,
whose humanitarian situation is already deplorable and
in need of the immediate attention of the international
community. We also echo the call made by other
delegations with regard to the responsibility of all
Member States to ensure the strict compliance of the
provisions of resolution 2270 (2016). Furthermore, I
reiterate that Uruguay is fully committed to continuing
to work towards a peaceful, diplomatic and political
solution to achieve the denculearization of the
Korean peninsula.

Lastly, for my second general comment, I note that,
as we understand it, the Security Council will have to
continue working to ensure that the negotiating process
that precedes the adoption of resolutions is more
transparent and inclusive.
