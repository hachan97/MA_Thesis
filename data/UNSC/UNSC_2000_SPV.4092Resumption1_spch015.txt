The President: I hope the Minister of State for
Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United
Kingdom will be with us for the rest of the week as we
continue our deliberations.

I am delighted that the Minister Delegate for
Cooperation and Francophonie of France is with us. I
know he has just returned from a trip to Africa of great
importance.
