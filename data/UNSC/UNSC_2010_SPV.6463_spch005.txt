The President: I shall now make a statement in
my capacity as the representative of the United States.

The resolution we have adopted today creating a
durable and appropriate institution that will outlast the
Tribunals themselves and complete their functions
assures the legacy of the International Criminal
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. We
applaud the work of the Austrian Chair of the Informal
Working Group on International Tribunals,
Ambassador Mayr-Harting, as well as the support of
the Office of Legal Affairs and the Tribunals
themselves in getting this important task accomplished.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.
