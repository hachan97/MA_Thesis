The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
operation in Cyprus (8/2005/353). Members also have
document S/2005/382, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.
I should like to inform the Council that, in my capacity
as President of the Council, I have met with the
representatives of the parties, who have confirmed to
me that they maintain their well-known positions vis-a-
Vis the item on the Council's agenda. On the basis of
those meetings, as President, with the consent of the
members of the Council, I have concluded that the
Council can proceed to take a decision on the draft
resolution before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall
now put the draft resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Algeria, Argentina, Benin, Brazil, China,
Denmark, France, Greece, Japan, Philippines,
Romania, Russian Federation, United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United
Republic of Tanzania, United States of America

The President (spoke in French): There were 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1604 (2005).

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 3.25 p.m.
