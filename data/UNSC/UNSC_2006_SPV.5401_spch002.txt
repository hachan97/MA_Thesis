Mr. Assaker (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): The
Lebanese Government welcomes the resolution
adopted by the Security Council, which mandates the
Secretary-General to begin negotiations with Lebanon
regarding the establishment of a tribunal of an
international character. The tribunal will follow up on
the findings of the investigation concerning the
assassination of Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri and his
companions. My Government considers the unanimous
vote on the resolution, coupled with the Lebanese
consensus on the subject, to be a clear indication of the
international community's strong commitment and
determination to punish ail those involved in that
terrorist crime. That, in turn, will deter criminals and
promote security and stability in Lebanon and
throughout the region.

The Lebanese Government will spare no effort to
conclude negotiations with the Secretary-General as
quickly as possible. My Government also expresses its
readiness to use all available means to arrive at a clear
and solid text for the agreement defining the form and
working methods of the tribunal - a text that would
earn the approval and support of the Council.

The values of truth, freedom and sovereignty are
complementary, and requisites for every democratic
regime. Uncovering the truth and trying those involved
will contribute significantly to the consolidation of
democracy in Lebanon. It will further reinforce
Lebanon's sovereignty and preserve the freedom of its
people. We recognize the role played by you, Mr.
President, by the members of the Security Council and
by the Secretary-General in the realization of those
objectives.
