Mr. Wang Yingfan (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China has always supported the peace process in
Bosnia and Herzegovina, and it is in this spirit that we
voted in favour of the draft resolution before us.

We note that the text of the resolution still
contains elements in support of the Declaration of the
Ministerial meeting of the Peace Implementation
Council, held in Brussels in May of this year. In our
View, as a signatory to the Dayton Agreement, the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia should have been
invited to the meeting. Isolating and excluding the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will not help to resolve
the problem of Bosnia and Herzegovina or the other
problems of the Balkan region.
