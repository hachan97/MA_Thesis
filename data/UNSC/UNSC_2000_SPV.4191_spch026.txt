Mr. Powles (New Zealand): I appreciate this
opportunity to speak to the Council again on the
subject of East Timor, and I thank you for it, Mr.
President. In June of this year my delegation expressed
to this Council its concern following the militia
incursions and attacks on United Nations peacekeepers,
including the wounding of an Australian peacekeeper.
Then in July a New Zealand peacekeeper was killed by
the militia, and we took the opportunity to address the
Council again, making the same point. On both
occasions, we called for renewed efforts by the
Indonesian Government to rein in the militia in West
Timor.

But since then, a Nepalese peacekeeper serving
with the New-Zealand-led battalion group has been
killed in combat. I take this opportunity to repeat my
Government's condolences in respect of his death and
also in respect of the recent Australian and Bangladeshi
casualties. In addition, there have been brutal attacks
on staff of the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As the
Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping
Operations, Mr. Annabi, reported this morning, the
situation appears to be getting worse, not better, with
militias operating into the territory of East Timor, as
well as along the border with West Timor.

That is intolerable, and my delegation would like
to take this opportunity to repeat New Zealand's
expectation that the Indonesian Government will take
effective action against those in West Timor and
elsewhere in Indonesia who seek to undermine East
Timor's political and territorial integrity and who are
responsible for intimidation and violence against
United Nations personnel and East Timorese civilians.
A year after the historic ballot in East Timor, it is high
time that the territory's political and territorial integrity
was respected.
