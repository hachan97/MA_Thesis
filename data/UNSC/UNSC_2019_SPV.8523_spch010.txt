Mr. Yao Shojun (China) (spoke in Chinese): At the
outset, I thank Ms. Bensouda for her briefing.

China is highly concerned over recent developments
in Libya and consistently believes that the Libyan issue
must be resolved through political means. We hope
that the parties to the conflict in Libya will keep the
interests of the country and its people at heart and
respond to the calls of the international community by
establishing a ceasefire as soon as possible and easing
tensions in the country.

We hope the parties to the conflict will return
to the path of settlement through peaceful dialogue
and consultations and actively promote the political
settlement process in Libya with a view to the timely
restoration of peace, stability and development in Libya.
This is a premise and foundation of the realization of
justice in Libya.

China supports all efforts that are conducive to
stabilizing the situation in Libya and promoting a
political solution to the situation there. We support
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General,
Mr. Ghassan Salame' and regional organizations, such
as the African Union, in pursuing their good offices
to form synergies. China is ready to work with the
international community in an active effort to achieve
lasting peace and security in Libya.

China's position on the International Criminal
Court remains unchanged.
