Mr. Guehenno: I should like first and foremost
to express our gratitude for the expressions of support
for the work of the United Nations Mine Action
Service and of our partners in the United Nations
system with regard to mine action.

We welcome in particular the recognition that
mine action should be incorporated into the mandates
of peacekeeping operations when appropriate. We also
welcome the Security Council's appreciation of the role
that mine action can play in peace-building efforts with
regard to disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration when former combatants are employed
for mine action purposes.

I would note that mine action is indeed much
broader than peacekeeping and the United Nations
Mine Action Service, as noted in a recent report of the
Secretary-General submitted to the General Assembly
during a very important debate. I think that the
integrated approach that takes place through the
presence of the United Nations Mine Action Service in
the Department of Peacekeeping Operations serves
mine action well because it means that the kind of mine
action that is undertaken in peacekeeping operations -
that is, operational demining to facilitate the
deployment of our troops - is done in a way that will
make coordination with humanitarian demining most
effective. Conducting demining operations according to
international mine action standards and recording those
actions in a standardized way through the Information
Management System for Mine Action means that
resources will be used in the most effective way and
that the cumulative nature of any mine action effort,
which unfortunately has to take its course over many
years, will be done in the most effective way, ensuring
that we do not repeat what has already been done. But
that requires a very rigorous approach to mine action. I

believe that the integrated approach taken by the Mine
Action Service has promoted that and that it will make
every effort to improve our modus operandi in the field
in order to make even better use of the limited funds
that exist for mine action.
