Mrs. Gasri (France) (spoke in French): France also
welcomes the Council's adoption of resolution 2475
(2019) today. It constitutes a major step forward, as
it is the first time the Security Council has dedicated
a resolution specifically to the rights of persons with
disabilities in the framework of its agenda on the
protection of civilians in armed conflict.

We warmly thank the co-penholders, Poland and
the United Kingdom, for their excellent work in recent
weeks. We pay tribute to all civil society actors, in
particular Humanity and Inclusion, formerly Handicap
International, who work tirelessly to promote and
defend the rights of people with disabilities in times of
peace as well as war.

Although 15 per cent of the world's population
lives with a disability, we all must and can do more to
defend the rights ofpeople with disabilities, ensure that
their specific protection needs are taken into account
and combat discrimination, in particular during armed
conflict. The Convention on the Rights of Persons
with Disabilities, whose universal ratification we
support, and the Charter on Inclusion of Persons with
Disabilities in Humanitarian Action are vital tools. We
should ensure their full implementation. The Council
can count on France's ongoing and decisive support in
that endeavour.
