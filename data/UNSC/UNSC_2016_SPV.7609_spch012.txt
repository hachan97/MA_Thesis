Mr. Gimolieca (Angola): We welcome and support
the peace process in Colombia between the Government
and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de
Colombia - Ejercito del Pueblo (FARC-EP). We praise
the decision and commitment of the parties to put their
differences aside and to engage in fruitful negotiations
aimed at putting an end to the conflict that has affected
the country for many decades. We commend the
Governments of Cuba and Norway for facilitating the
negotiations, and the Government of Colombia and the
FARC-EP for signing, respecting and implementing the
final peace agreement in order to consolidate peace for
the well-being of the Colombian people.

Finally, we hope that in the future the United
Nations political mission will carry out its task with
professionalism and impartiality.
