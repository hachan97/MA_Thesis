The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Australia, Belgium, Chile, Indonesia,
Japan, New Zealand and Portugal, in which they
request to be invited to participate in the discussion of
the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with
the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the
Council, to invite those representatives to participate in
the discussion without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Dauth
(Australia), Mr. De Loecker (Belgium),
Mr. Valde's (Chile), Mr. Hidayat (Indonesia),
Mr. Satoh (Japan), Mr. MacKay (New Zealand)
and Mr. Seixas da Costa (Portugal) took the seats
reserved for them at the side of the Council
Chamber

The President (spoke in French): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno, Under-
Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Guehenno to take a seat at the
Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno, Under-
Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations. As
there is no list of speakers for this meeting, I would
invite those who wish to take the floor to so indicate to
the Secretariat as from now.

I give the floor to Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno.
