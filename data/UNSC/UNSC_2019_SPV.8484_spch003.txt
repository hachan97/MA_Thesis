Mr. Alotaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): We
want to thank you, Madam President, for calling for a
minute of silence in honour of the victims of the terrible
terrorist attack in New Zealand, and we want to express
our condolences to the Government and the people of
New Zealand and to the families of the victims.

Kuwait today voted in favour of resolution 2459
(2019). We hope that all the provisions of the resolution
will be implemented during both the pre-transition
and transition periods for the benefit of the people of
South Sudan first and foremost, and for preserving
their rights and supporting the political process. The
positive developments in South Sudan are apparent
to all observers. That is why we must send a message
encouraging the efforts to make continued progress
without abandoning our role in closely monitoring the
situation there through the United Nations Mission in
South Sudan.

We thank the United States delegation as the
penholder, as well as all our partner members in
the Council who participated constructively in
the negotiations.
