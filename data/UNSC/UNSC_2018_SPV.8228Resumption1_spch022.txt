Mr. Tumysh (Kazakhstan): Our position remains
unchanged and consistent. Due to well-known
historical reasons, Kazakhstan has always taken a firm
and resolute stance of uncompromising condemnation
of any use of weapons of mass destruction, including
chemical weapons. We do so as that is an extremely
heinous action and an unacceptable war crime. We have
also been in support of attaching paramount importance
to the creation of a new investigative mechanism. That
has been strongly reiterated, and we have pressed for its
urgency. Impunity for chemical crimes is not acceptable.
It sends the wrong signal to those who continue to use
or intend to use such an extremely heinous weapon.
However, in order to punish anyone, we must be able to
prove guilt completely and irrefutably. In that regard,
the creation ofa full-fledged, impartial and independent
investigative tool is of the utmost necessity for all.

We have worked in earnest with the delegations of
the United States and the Russian Federation. We must
recognize that the use of chemical weapons in Syria
continues, along with the persistent threat of chemical
terrorism, to present a grave reality. In addition, many
allegations of the use of chemical agents in Syria
are still undisclosed. Based on the aforementioned
circumstances and understanding the need to preserve
this mechanism, we supported both draft resolutions
intended to create new investigative mechanisms. We
urge that we all work together for the maintenance and
strengthening of international peace and security.
