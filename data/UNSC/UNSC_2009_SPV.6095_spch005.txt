The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank
Mr. Mohamed Abdullahi Omaar, Minister for Foreign
Affairs of Somalia, for his statement.

In view of the fact that the African Union is an
important partner of the United Nations in the peace
process in Somalia and that it has a peacekeeping
mission there, and since the Commissioner for Peace
and Security of the African Union, Mr. Ramtane
Lamamra, is with us today, he will be given the floor
under rule 39 of the provisional rules of procedure. The
information he will be presenting to us is
complementary to what the representative of the
Secretary-General and the Minister for Foreign Affairs
of Somalia have provided. I therefore propose that we
give the floor to Mr. Lamamra to make a statement
before members of the Council. This is an exceptional
proposal and should not be construed as setting a
precedent in any way. Are there any objections?
