The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the
representative of Indonesia for his kind words
addressed to me and to other members of the Council. I
invite him to resume the seat reserved for him at the
side of the Council Chamber.

The next speaker is the representative of
Malaysia, whom I invite to take a seat and to make his
statement.
