We are deeply troubled by the Russian and Chinese politicization of this humanitarian issue. Yesterday, Russia and China vetoed a text that would have met the humanitarian needs of those in north-western Syria. Russia then put forward its own text, focused on only one crossing, That would deprive 1.3 million people of the cross-border aid they rely on via Bab Al-Salam. There is simply no reasonable justification for shutting off that vital lifeline. The need for two crossings to be renewed for 12 months has been made abundantly clear, including by the Secretary-General. Misleading language has no place in a Security Council text. We therefore cannot accept Russia's wilful misrepresentation of sanctions. Members of the Council have repeatedly made clear that sanctions do not apply to food or medicine. There are also exemptions for humanitarian activity in place for United Kingdom- European Union sanctions. We need to be clear that it is the actions of the regime that are the main driver of the dire humanitarian situation in Syria. The United Kingdom is one of the largest donors of humanitarian aid to the Syria crisis. Our total contribution stands at Â£3.3 billion. If Russia and China truly care about the humanitarian situation, they should support those suffering from the conflict rather than closing down routes for aid to reach them. It is beyond belief that, despite what we all know of the devastating impact of the coronavirus disease, they are obstructing an effective response in a region already ravaged by conflict. In the light of that, the United Kingdom will vote against the draft resolution. We must do better. Russia and China still have time to reconsider and support a compromise solution that brings the Council together in the name of humanity. We urge them to do so.
