Mr. Zhao Yong (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
listened carefully to Prosecutor Bensouda's briefing.
The current situation in Darfur is generally stable.
China welcomes the efforts of the Sudanese Government
and the relevant rebel groups to implement the Doha
Document for Peace in Darfur. We hope that the parties
concerned in the issue of Darfur will adhere to the
political settlement, take an active part in the national
dialogue and, through dialogue and consultation, seek
a comprehensive political solution to the issue. We
also hope that countries that have influence over the
rebel groups in Darfur will play a constructive role in
this process. We call on the international community
to work to create external conditions conducive to a
political solution to the Darfur issue.

China's position on the involvement of the
International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Darfur
issue remains unchanged. At the same time, we also
believe that the concerns of the African Union and the
countries concerned about the ICC's involvement in
Darfur deserve serious attention.
