The President: At the outset of the meeting, I
should like, on behalf of the Council, to extend our
words of gratitude and appreciation to Ambassador
Said Ben Mustapha, who will be completing his term in
New York shortly. Ambassador Ben Mustapha has
served his country with great dedication. As the
representative of Tunisia on the Security Council, he
has shown commitment to the cause of world peace and
to the purpose and principles of the Charter of the
United Nations. Through his insightfulness and
profound understanding of international affairs, in
particular as regards Africa and the Middle East, and
his diplomatic skill, as exemplified by his leadership of
the Security Council as its President during the month
of February, Ambassador Ben Mustapha made an
important contribution to the work of the Council. We
wish him every success in his future endeavours.
