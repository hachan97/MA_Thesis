Mrs. Van Vlierberge (Belgium) (spoke in French): Belgium welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 2543 (2020), on the situation in Afghanistan. We commend the penholders and all members of the Council for the close collaboration that led to this result. Today's resolution sends a strong and important signal of the commitment of the Council to all parties in Afghanistan at a critical time, given the start of intra-Afghan negotiations last weekend. In particular, we welcome the fact that the new mandate strengthens the capacity of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) to report violations and abuses against children, which will surely bolster the child protection efforts of all parties. That is of great importance in the light of the peace talks under way and the fact that, according to United Nations reports, the conflict in Afghanistan is the world's most violent conflict for children. We commend the launch of intra-Afghan dialogue and call for an effective and permanent ceasefire that will put an end to the intolerable violence against civilians. We also remind all parties that any agreement reached must protect the rights of all Afghans, including women. In conclusion, I reiterate Belgium's support of UNAMA and the Afghan people. The United Nations must play a key role at this critical time for Afghanistan.
