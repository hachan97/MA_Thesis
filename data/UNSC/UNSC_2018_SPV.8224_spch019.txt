Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I will not detain my
colleagues for very long. There is another very good
quote from Lewis Carroll in Through the Looking
Glass, and What Alice Found There: "Why, sometimes
I've believed as many as six impossible things before
breakfast." I think that is the quote that suits my Russian
colleague best. Ijust wanted to say that we are of course
committed to keeping the Council updated. We will
share with the Council, at the Council's request, as
much information as we can, as and when we have it,
and in accordance with developments.

The meeting rose at 4.50 pm.
