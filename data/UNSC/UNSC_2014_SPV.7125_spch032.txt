Mr. Churkin (spoke in Russian): We are not sitting
with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE). I cannot talk about the OSCE. We are
not talking about the OSCE. It has its own functions.
We supported Mr. Eliasson's mission to Ukraine. As for
an OSCE mission, that has to be discussed. I support
what Mr. Sergeyev said early to the effect that there
is too much disinformation and too many statements,
particularly those that are not rooted in reality. Much of
what Sir Mark Lyall Grant said about what is going on in
Crimea is just not in line with reality.
