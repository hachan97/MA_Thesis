Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
listened very attentively to the briefing by Mr. Moreno-
Ocampo.

At the moment, the political transition process in
Libya has entered a critical phase. We hope that the
Libyan people will maintain ethnic harmony and
safeguard national unity, actively respond to all
challenges and achieve at an early date its social
stability and political and economic reconstruction.

Parliamentary elections will be held in Libya in
June. That is of great significance in furthering the
Libyan political transition process. China hopes that
Libya's interim Government will, in accordance with
the road map for its political process and timetable,
steadily push forward the preparatory work on the
elections.

The international community should continue to
render support and assistance to the national
reconstruction efforts in Libya. China's position on the
International Criminal Court (ICC) question remains
unchanged. We hope that the ICC's actions in
implementing the relevant resolutions will be
conducive to the reconstruction efforts in Libya. The
resolution should be strictly implemented.

The reports of the International Commission of
Inquiry on Libya established by the Human Rights
Council and those of the International Criminal Court
both indicate that NATO's activities in Libya resulted
in civilian casualties. China is concerned about this.
The Security Council has the right and obligation to
know the truth.
