The President (interpretation from Chinese): I thank
the representative of The Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia for his kind words addressed to my delegation.

In view of the lateness of the hour I intend, with the
concurrence of the members of the Council, to suspend the
meeting.

The meeting was suspended at ] p.m. and resumed at
4 p.m.

The President (interpretation from Chinese): It is my
understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to the
vote on the draft resolutions before it. If I hear no
objection, I shall put the three draft resolutions to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

 

I shall first call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements before the voting.
