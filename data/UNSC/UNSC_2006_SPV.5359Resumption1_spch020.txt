The President: As 18 more speakers remain, I
request once again that representatives limit their
interventions to 5 minutes so that others may also
intervene. I thank them for their understanding.

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Said
Djinnit, Commissioner for Peace and Security of the
African Union.
