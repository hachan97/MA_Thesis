Mr. Reuben (Israel): I would like to respond. It
is somewhat surreal to hear a representative of a
regime that brutally killed hundreds of its own civilians
and citizens over the past few weeks, and which
continues to do so as we speak, talk about terrorism.

As a country that actively supports, harbours and
finances terrorist organizations, and that hosts the
headquarters of internationally recognized terrorist
organizations, Syria's practices indeed reflect its long-
standing perspective on sponsoring terrorism.

It is a shame and a disgrace for Syria to exploit
the memory of the victims of the Holocaust.
