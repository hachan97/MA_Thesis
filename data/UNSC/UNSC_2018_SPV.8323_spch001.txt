The President: I should like to take this opportunity
to pay tribute, on behalf of the Security Council, to His
Excellency Mr. Olof Skoog, Permanent Representative
of Sweden to the United Nations, for his service as
President of the Council for the month of July. I think
it was an outstanding presidency by our Swedish
colleagues and I am sure I speak for all members of
the Council in expressing our deep appreciation to
Ambassador Skoog and all of the Swedish team for the
great diplomatic skill, imagination and flair with which
they conducted the Council's business last month. I
thank them very much.
