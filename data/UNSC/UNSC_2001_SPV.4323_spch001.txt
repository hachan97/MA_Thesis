The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Burundi, the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa and
Uganda, in which they request to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Nteturuye
(Burundi), Mr. Ileka (Democratic Republic of the Congo), Mr. Andjaba (Namibia), Mr. Gasana
(Rwanda), Ms. Ndhlovu (South Africa) and
Mr. Beyendeza (Uganda) took the seats reserved
for them at the side ofthe Council Chamber.

The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report on the Security Council mission to the Great
Lakes region from 15 to 26 May 2001, document
8/2001/521.

I should like to draw the attention of the members
of the Council to document S/2001/525, which contains
the text of a letter dated 24 May 2001 from the
Permanent Representative of Zambia to the United
Nations addressed to the President of the Security
Council, transmitting the text of a communique
produced at a joint meeting of the Political Committee
for the Implementation of the Lusaka Ceasefire
Agreement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
and the United Nations Security Council mission to the
Great Lakes region.
I would also like to welcome the Secretary-
General to this meeting.
