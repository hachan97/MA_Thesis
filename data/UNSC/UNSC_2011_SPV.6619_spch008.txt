Mr. McIntosh (Liberia): I did not anticipate that
I would have a second opportunity to meet with the
Council within 72 hours. I therefore consider it an
honour and a privilege to be able to personally thank
the Council, on behalf of the President, Mrs. Ellen
Johnson-Sirleaf, the Government and the people of
Liberia for the action that the Council has just taken in
extending the mandate of the United Nations Mission
in Liberia (UNMIL) for another 12 months.

It is our understanding that the Council's
deliberations during these past two days on the time
frame of the extension have been tedious, time-
consuming and objective. That makes the final decision
all the more valued and appreciated. We are heartened
by the unanimous vote that has just been taken.

As I mentioned in my remarks a few days ago
(see S/PV.6610), Liberia faces many challenges, and
UNMIL's presence contributes immensely to help us
resolve them. We know that the Liberian Government
and people will have to continue the march forward
towards ensuring sustainable peace and sustained
development long after the peacekeeping component of
the United Nations work in Liberia has ended.

As I also mentioned, we are very keen to ensure
that national capacity exists at appreciable levels in
critical sectors so that a transition from UNMIL to
national authority is as smooth and seamless as
possible.

As I also mentioned, we welcome the arrival of
the United Nations technical assessment mission by the
end of April 2012. In that regard, I thank the Council
for its prudent decision, and affirm that the
Government will do all within its power to use
judicially the extended period to accelerate transition
planning and implementation. We will continue to
count on the Council's support in all our endeavours in
this period of our partnership.
