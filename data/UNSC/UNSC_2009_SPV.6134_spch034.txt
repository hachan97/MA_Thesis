Judge Byron: I think that I need only say that the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda is in
general very pleased with the expressions of
confidence expressed by the States members of the
Security Council. I would like to reiterate our
commitment to work as hard as we can to honour the
mandates of the completion strategy and to bring the
trials completely to an end as soon as possible.
