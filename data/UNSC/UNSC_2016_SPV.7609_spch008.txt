Mr. Van Bohemen (New Zealand): I wish warmly
to thank Foreign Minister Nin Novoa, and I welcome
Foreign Minister Holguin Cuellar to the Council today.

New Zealand was very pleased to co-sponsor
resolution 2261 (2016) and welcomes its unanimous
adoption. The Council's flexible and quick response
to the request for a political mission is a welcome
development. As others have noted, it is a welcome and
somewhat unusual development that a country should
come to the Council of its own accord for help, and
even better that it is doing so in the context of a peace
process. We hope that this mission, as the international
component and coordinator of the tripartite monitoring
and verification mechanism, will generate further
confidence in the Colombian peace process.

New Zealand congratulates President Santos
Calderon for the courage and determination that he and
his country have demonstrated in pushing for a durable
solution to a protracted conflict. We, too, commend
the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia for

taking the road to peace and for sticking with it through
the long negotiations. We also congratulate and thank
Cuba and Norway, as well as Chile and Venezuela,
for their vital roles in shepherding the peace process,
and we welcome the role that the region as a whole has
played in the peace process. It represents a positive
example of a regionally led solution to a long-standing
conflict.

New Zealand is committed to supporting
Colombia's efforts to find lasting peace. We are
pleased that our partnership with Colombia and the
burgeoning relationship with the Pacific Alliance will
be further strengthened with the opening of a New
Zealand embassy in Bogota in the near future. We wish
Colombia well in advancing the peace process in the
coming months. No one expects the road ahead to be
easy, but as has been demonstrated today, the Council
and the international community stand ready to help.
