The President: The Security Council will now
continue its consideration of the item on its agenda.
The Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2003/891, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Pakistan, South Africa,
the Sudan and the Syrian Arab Republic.

It is my understanding that the Security Council
is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
before it. If I hear no objection, I shall now put the
draft resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by Show of hands.

In favour:
Angola, Cameroon, Chile, China, France, Guinea,
Mexico, Pakistan, Russian Federation, Spain,
Syrian Arab Republic.

Against:
United States of America.

Abstaining:
Bulgaria, Germany, United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland.

The President: The result of the voting is as
follows: 11 votes in favour, 1 against and 3 abstentions.
The draft resolution has not been adopted, owing to the
negative vote of a permanent member of the Council.

I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
