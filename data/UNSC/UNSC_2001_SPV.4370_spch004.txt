Mr. Koonjul (Mauritius): My delegation is
profoundly shocked by yesterday's traumatic events,
the impact and magnitude of which are yet to be felt
and fully assessed. On behalf of the Government of
Mauritius and its people, I wish to convey our deepest
sympathies and condolences to the Government and
people of the United States of America and, more
particularly, to the families of the victims.

We unreservedly condemn in the strongest terms
the inhuman and barbaric terrorist acts that have taken
the lives of thousands of innocent victims, including
women and children, and which have caused
considerable material damage. We are confident that
the people of America will rise up to the challenges
and overcome the sufferings and atrocities they have
just experienced.

The people of America have once again shown
their exemplary resilience in such tragic circumstances.
These attacks, while targeting the United States, are
aimed at democracy and the free world. All of us who
believe in the cardinal values of democracy stand
shoulder-to-shoulder with the American people in the
struggle to preserve peace and the rule of law.

The perpetration of such cowardly acts clearly
demonstrates that no country, no matter how prepared
it may be, is immune to terrorist attacks. Yesterday's
acts once again confirm that terrorism knows no
bounds or boundaries. Indeed, terrorism represents a
major threat to international peace and security. We
believe that this issue should be addressed in a
comprehensive manner, in the framework of
international cooperation. In that regard, we would
support the idea of holding a special Security Council
summit to discuss ways and means of combating
terrorism in all its forms and proportions.

Like other delegations, Mauritius stands ready to
cooperate with the United States and the international
community to find the perpetrators of yesterday's acts
and bring them to justice.
