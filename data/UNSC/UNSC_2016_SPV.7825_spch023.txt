Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): As far as I am concerned, the discussion
ended somewhat unexpectedly for me when you took
the floor in your national capacity, Sir. I wanted to say
a few words after the voting as well. I will be brief,
since we have discussed the situation in Syria many
times, including just recently. We have already stated
our position.

Some rhetorical, perhaps even polemical, questions
were asked withregard to what Russiais trying to achieve.
I will tell the Council what Russia is trying to achieve:
Russia is attempting to find a solution - including
through the Security Council - that would have a
chance at success.

The initiative that Mr. Sergey Lavrov and Secretary
of State John Kerry discussed two days ago has a
chance to succeed because it would lead to an effective
end to the tragedy in Aleppo, which has lasted for many
years 4 both in eastern and western Aleppo, which is
actually one huge area with ongoing military activities.

I regret that the representative of the United States
was so aggressive in her statement. Once again, it
was clear from her statement that the delegation of
the United States is somehow trying to disavow the
initiative of Secretary of Statey Kerry. I hope that the
Secretary of State will find the strenght to pursue this
initiative, because it could lead to an effective and
lasting solution.

I would like to say just a few words on the statement
made by the representative of Ukraine. I thought it
quite curious that the criticism that the representative
of Ukraine tried to direct at Damascus could also be
levelled at Kyiv, word for word, with its anti-terrorist
operation in the Donbas region.
