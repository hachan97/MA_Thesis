The President: In accordance with rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite the
representative of Yemen to participate in this meeting.

In accordance with rule 39 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure, I invite the following
briefers to participate in this meeting: Mr. Ismail
Ould Cheikh Ahmed, Special Envoy of the Secretary-
General for Yemen, and Mr. Stephen O'Brien, Under-
SecretaryGeneral for Humanitarian Affairs and
Emergency Relief Coordinator.

The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda.

The Security Council has not discussed the
situation in Yemen since October (see S/PV.7797). For
this reason, I believe that it is a particularly opportune
moment for the Council to receive an update on the
political negotiations, including for a renewed cessation
of hostilities, and on the dire humanitarian situation.

I give the floor to Mr. Ould Cheikh Ahmed.
