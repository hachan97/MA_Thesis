The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2013/341, which contains the report of
the Secretary-General on measuring the effectiveness
of the support provided by the United Nations system
for the promotion of the rule of law in conflict and post-
conflict situations.

I also wish to draw the attention ofCouncil members
to document S/2013/75, which contains the text of
a letter dated 3 February 2014 from the Permanent
Representative of Lithuania to the United Nations
addressed to the Secretary-General, transmitting a
concept note on the item under consideration.

The Council has before it the text of a statement by
the President on behalf of the Council on the subject
of today's meeting. I sincerely thank Council members
for their valuable contributions to the statement and the
flexibility thas has been shown during the nogotiations,
which took a little bit longer than we expected. But we
have succeeded with the Council's support. Certainly,
for a beginner in the Council, we are absolutely grateful
for having produced this product with members' help,
insights and advice.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among the members of the Council, I shall take it
that the members of the Security Council agree to the
statement, which will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/20l4/5.

It is so decided.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at12.20p.m.
