The President: Of course, Mr. Ambassador, in
my national capacity I can say I agree with every word
you said. But I also noted that the delegation of
Guinea-Bissau and the World Bank were taking down
with enthusiasm some of the things you said about the
massive commitment of donors, the need for debt relief
and budget support, and although this is not a pledging
session, we will take that with us towards that
particular session.
