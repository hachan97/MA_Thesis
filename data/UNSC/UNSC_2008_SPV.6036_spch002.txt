Mr. Grauls (Belgium): This is the eighth 90-day
report to the Security Council in accordance with
paragraph 18 (h) of resolution 1737 (2006). The report
covers the period from 12 September to 10 December
2008, during which the Committee held one session of
informal consultations to hear two briefings. In my
previous report, I noted that the members of the
Committee were considering a written request for
certain specific information from a Member State. I
wish to add now that the Committee subsequently
responded to the communication from the Member
State.

On 15 October 2008, the United States provided a
briefing on its efforts to implement paragraphs 3 and 4
of resolution 1737 (2006) and paragraph 8 of
resolution 1803 (2008). Those paragraphs relate to the
transfer of goods and technology to the Islamic
Republic of Iran that could contribute to enrichment-
related, reprocessing or heavy water-related activities,
or to the development of nuclear weapon delivery
systems; and to the transfer of any further items that, as
determined by the State, could contribute to the pursuit
of activities related to other topics about which the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has
expressed concerns or which the IAEA has identified
as outstanding. The general rule established by
resolution 1737 (2006) was that, with a few exceptions,
such transfers were prohibited.

Resolution 1803 (2008) widened the prohibition
to include the transfer of dual-use items, with the
2
exception of certain specific items to be used in light
water reactors and under the framework of IAEA
technical cooperation. Following the briefing, some
other members of the Committee also shared with the
Committee the steps they had taken to implement the
relevant provisions.

On the same date, Norway, a non-member of the
Security Council, provided a briefing on its plans to
strengthen the effectiveness of the regulatory oversight
of the safety at the Bushehr nuclear power plant in
Iran. The Norwegian project, to be implemented under
the auspices of the IAEA, falls under the scope of the
aforementioned exceptions.

With respect to those exceptions, I would also
like to mention that by notes verbales dated
7N0vember and 21 November 2008, the Russian
Federation, as it has done in the past, notified the
Committee of supplies it had delivered for the light
water reactor at the Bushehr nuclear power plant.

Finally, Mr. President, with regard to reporting by
States on their implementation of all the relevant
measures contained in resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747
(2007) and 1803 (2008), the updated figures are as
follows: 90 reports under resolution 1737 (2006), 77
reports under resolution 1747 (2007) and 63 reports
under resolution 1803 (2008).

As you are aware, Mr. President, by its resolution
1835 (2008) of 27 September 2008, the Council
reaffirmed the three resolutions, as well as resolution
1696 (2006), and also reaffirmed its commitment to an
early negotiated solution through a dual-track approach
to the Iranian nuclear issue and welcomed the
continuing efforts in that regard.

The Council also called upon Iran to comply fully
and without delay with its obligations under the
previously mentioned resolutions of the Security
Council and to meet the requirements of the IAEA
Board of Governors.

As this is my last 90-day report to the Security
Council, I would like to conclude by thanking the
members of the 1737 Committee for their cooperation.
