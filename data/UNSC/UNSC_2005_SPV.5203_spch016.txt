Mr. Manongi (United Republic of Tanzania):
We, too, welcome Mr. Kiganahe, Minister of Justice of
Burundi, and are thankful for his presentation here this
afternoon. We are also thankful for the briefing given
by Assistant Secretary-General Zacklin.

We are immensely pleased by the agreement of
the parties in Burundi in support of the establishment
of the mechanism for accountability. The fact that there
is a broad consensus in Burundi as to this approach
should be welcomed and supported by the Council. We
commend this resolve and consider it among the
positive measures adopted by the Transitional
Government and as a reflection of the Government's
good faith in resolving the difficulties that Burundi
faces.

In our view, the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation
Agreement was not cast in stone. New perspectives are
being offered in an attempt to promote national
reconciliation, and we must support such attempts. In
extending that support, we, too, are conscious of the
fact that Burundi will require considerable support
from the international community. We should not fail
it. We therefore join in appealing for international
support in funding the mechanisms being envisaged in
Burundi for justice and reconciliation. In our view, this
heavy responsibility would have best been served
through assessed contributions. Ending impunity must
be our collective responsibility and is in our own self-
interest.

Lastly, we join the Minister in expressing great
caution regarding the relationship between the truth
and reconciliation commission and the special chamber
of the judicial system in Burundi.
