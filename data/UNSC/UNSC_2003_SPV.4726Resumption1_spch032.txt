Mr. Padilla Tonos (Dominican Republic) (spoke in Spanish): In the present circumstances, the
Dominican Republic is committed to participate in all
efforts of the United Nations and the international
community to provide for the humanitarian needs of
the Iraqi people. It supports the idea that the Security
Council give the Secretary-General the requisite
authority and means to carry out that urgent task.

The Dominican Republic also hopes that the
military action under way in Iraq will be of short
duration, that loss of human life and material damage
on all sides will be kept to a minimum, that the Geneva
Conventions will be respected in accordance with
international humanitarian law, that the territorial
integrity, sovereignty and political independence of
Iraq will be preserved, that as early as possible
conditions will be created to allow the Iraqi people to
live in a freedom and democracy, and that Iraq will be
able, as soon as possible, to be fully reintegrated into
the international community within the legal and
political order which is perfectly articulated in the
United Nations Charter. This is the Charter of an
Organization that today must be preserved more than
ever, under all circumstances, while within this
Organization we must strengthen the unity of the
Security Council as the primary organ responsible for
international peace and security.
