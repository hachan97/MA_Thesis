The President (spoke in Russian): There are no
more speakers inscribed on the list of speakers. I would
like to thank all participants for their contributions to
this meeting presided over by the Russian Federation.

As this is the last scheduled meeting ofthe Security
Council for the month of September 2015, before
adjourning the meeting I would like to express the
sincere appreciation of the delegation of the Russian
Federation to the members of the Council, especially
the Permanent Representatives, their respective staff
and the secretariat of the Security Council, as well
as to the conference services, the interpreters and
security staff, who have reliably ensured our security
in this trying month. We could not have done it alone,
of course, without the hard work, support and positive
contributions of every delegation and the representatives
of the Secretariat. As we end our presidency, I know
I speak on behalf of the entire Security Council in
wishing the delegation of Spain good luck in its work
during the month of October.

The meeting rose at 6. 35 p.m.
