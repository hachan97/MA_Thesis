The President: I thank the representative of the
Islamic Republic of Iran for his kind words addressed
to me.

I should like to inform the Council that I have
received a letter from the representative of Lebanon in
which he requests to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the discussion, without the right to vote,
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Diab
(Lebanon) took the seat reservedfor him at the
side of the Council Chamber.

The President: The next speaker on my list is the
representative of Brazil, I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
