Mr. DeLaurentis (United States of America): I
do not wish to detract from the reports we have heard
from the three counter-terrorism-related Committees
this morning and now this afternoon, but I want to
respond for the record to the comments made by two
delegations with respect to the case of Luis Posada
Carriles.

Contrary to the statements the Council has heard,
the United States has taken a number of law
enforcement actions with respect to Luis Posada
Carriles, which we have described in detail on several
occasions. The measures taken include the imposition
of reporting and monitoring requirements on Posada
and an indictment of him on several criminal charges.
His trial on these charges is pending. These actions are
consistent with international law, as well as with our
domestic legal framework that provides for due process
and various constitutional safeguards.
