The President (spoke in Spanish): There are still
a number of speakers remaining on my list. Because of
the lateness of the hour, with the concurrence of
members of the Council, I now intend to suspend the
meeting.

The Council will resume its consideration of the
item on its agenda at 3.15 pm.

The meeting was suspended at 1.20 pm.
