Mr. Shen B0 (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
supports the complete destruction of Libya's remaining
chemical weapons stockpiles. We hope that all parties
will carefully implement resolution 2298 (2016)
just adopted by the Security Council to ensure the
elimination of Libya's chemical-weapon stockpiles in a
safe and expeditious manner.

We support continued inclusive political dialogue
among Libyan parties so as to resolve differences
through negotiations. We support the constructive
role of the United Nations, countries in the region and
organizations in the subregion in helping to restore
peace and stability in Libya.

China has always been opposed to the use of
chemical weapons by any State, organization or
individual. We hope that the international community
will take effective measures to prevent the use of
chemicals as weapons by terrorist organizations and
individuals, so as to safeguard peace and security in
the region.
