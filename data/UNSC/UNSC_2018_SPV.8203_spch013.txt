Mr. Alemu (Ethiopia): We have been following
the news about the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury,
in the United Kingdom. We would like to express our
sympathy for and solidarity with the families of the
victims, as well as the Government and the people of
the United Kingdom. We have taken note of the letter
that was circulated yesterday (S/2018/218, annex) from
the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom addressed to
the Secretary-General on the incident, and we thank the
delegation of the United Kingdom for its briefing today.

Our position on the use of chemical weapons is
well known. We firmly condemn any use of chemical
weapons by any State or non-State actor. The use of
chemicals as weapons is unacceptable and constitutes
a serious Violation of international law. That said, we
hope that the necessary independent investigation
into the incident in Salisbury will be conducted and
also vetted, including through consultation and the
exchange of information on the basis of the relevant
provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention, with
a view to bringing those responsible to justice. We
believe that cooperation in good faith between Russia
and the United Kingdom will be critical to ensuring
that this issue does not get out of hand and undermine
relations between the two countries even further. In that
regard, we hope and trust that given the very justifiable
concern of the United Kingdom, all those concerned
will cooperate fully so that the matter can be addressed
fairly and in a way that will help to allay the concerns
of the United Kingdom.
