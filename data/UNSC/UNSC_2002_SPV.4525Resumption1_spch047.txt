Ms. Lajous (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): The
delegation of Mexico would like to express its
gratitude for the Secretary-General's efforts to comply
with what was set out in resolution 1405 (2002), in
particular with respect to his initiative to obtain exact
information on the events in the Jenin refugee camp.

International peacekeeping and security are
fundamental goals of this Organization, and thus we
must respect international humanitarian law. All United
Nations Members, without exception, have agreed to
respect, and to make respected, the decisions along
these lines, in accordance with the letter and spirit of
the United Nations Charter. However, the non-
implementation of Security Council resolutions, in
particular with respect to the Middle East question, not
only has seriously undermined the possibilities for
reaching a just solution for the region, but also
jeopardizes the Council's own credibility before the
international community.

In the specific case concerning us - the non-
implementation of resolution 1405 (2002) - my
delegation would like to recall that this was drafted,
particularly in paragraph 2, with moderate wording
under the legal supposition that it would be complied
with, in good faith, by all the parties concerned.
Unfortunately, this was not the case, despite the very
commendable efforts by the Secretary-General and the
team appointed by him.

In this respect, my delegation would like to
reiterate that the international community cannot forget
what happened in the past few weeks, in particular in
Jenin. The United Nations and the Security Council
cannot abdicate their moral and legal responsibility to
clarify the facts, whatever the consequences for those
involved may be.
