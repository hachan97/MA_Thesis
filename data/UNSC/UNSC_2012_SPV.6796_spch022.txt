The President (spoke in Chinese): We are drawing
near to the end of the work of the Council for this month.
On behalf of the Chinese delegation, I should like to
thank all the members of the Council, in particular my
colleagues the Permanent Representatives, the Deputy
Permanent Representatives and their teams. My thanks
also go the Secretariat for all the support it has provided
to facilitate our work. Indeed, we had a very busy
month. We reached consensus on some major issues.
Without the support and hard work of delegations and of
the Secretariat, including the interpreters, translators,
conference officers and sound engineers, we would not
have been able to complete our work on our own.

As China wraps up its presidency, I should like, on
behalf ofthe Council, to wish the Colombian delegation
a successful month of July.

There are no more names inscribed on the list of
speakers. The Security Council has thus concluded
the present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
