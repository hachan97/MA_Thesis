Mr. Almunayekh (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At
the outset, I would like to thank Ms. Rosemary DiCarlo,
Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, for her
briefing on developments in the Sea of Azov.

The recent escalation oftensions in the Sea of Azov
is very worrying. We call on both sides to exercise
self-restraint and undertake all measures necessary to
diffuse military tensions in the Sea of Azov. We call
on them to abide by the United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea, and urge them to demonstrate the
necessary political will and to renew their commitment
to the full implementation of the Minsk agreements in
order to resolve the conflict and maintain security and
stability in the region.

We reiterate our commitment to respecting
Ukraine's unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity
Within its internationally recognized borders, and
to not interfere in its internal affairs. We hope that
the parties involved will fully implement resolution
2202 (2015), the Minsk agreements for peace, and
presidential statement S/PRST/2018/12 of 6 June.
We also hope that both sides will seek to arrive at a
comprehensive and balanced solution to this issue
through dialogue, as stipulated by Article 33 of the
Charter of the United Nations. We stress the need to
do so within the Normandy format and the Trilateral
Contact Group in order to achieve immediate progress
towards implementing the Minsk agreements.
