Mr. Seck (Senegal) (spoke in French): The
Senegalese delegation welcomes the adoption of
resolution 2303 (2016), which authorizes the deployment
of a police component to Burundi.

Just yesterday in this Chamber, our debate on
peacebuilding (see S/PV.7750) demonstrated, inter
alia, that the political and security situation in
Burundi remained very worrisome. By adopting this
resolution, the Council expresses its full support for the
inter-Burundian dialogue, under the aegis of the East
African Community through the good offices of the
Special Adviser, in the spirit and letter of the Arusha
Peace and Reconciliation Agreement.

We are suddenly in a prevention situation to ensure
that the worse does not occur. The African Union and
the United Nations must monitor the situation together
to assist the Government of Burundi and the opposition
in holding a peaceful dialogue.
