Mr. Ebner (Austria): Austria condemns all acts
that attempt to undermine the peace process in
Somalia. We urge all parties to join the Djibouti peace
process and to support the Transitional Federal
Government in its efforts to stabilize the situation in
the country.
Austria voted in favour of resolution 1907 (2009).
In that context, it was important for my delegation that
the imposition of targeted sanctions under that
resolution was based on a two-step approach. It is our
understanding that any decision on specific
designations will be made in the framework of the
sanctions Committee established pursuant to resolution
751 (1992) in accordance with the procedural
guarantees of resolution 1844 (2008). We hope that the
Eritrean Government will use the intervening time to
address the concerns of the international community.

Austria believes that, beyond the imposition of
sanctions, it will be important to continue to search for
solutions to the underlying political problems. The
Government of Eritrea, for its part, should seize every
opportunity to engage in constructive dialogue.
