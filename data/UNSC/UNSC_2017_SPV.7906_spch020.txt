Mr. Rosselli (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): I
would like to join other speakers in thanking the
presidency of the United Kingdom for this initiative.
We were also grateful for the presence among us of the
British Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson. We thank
the Secretary-General, Ms. Sunday and Mr. Mogae for
their statements.

Today's presidential statement (S/PRST/2017/4) and
the Secretary-General's statement have covered all of
the points in the text that we prepared for my statement
this afternoon, so I will be very brief.

I will just say that the presidential statement
establishes and clearly outlines five measures that
are needed if progress is to be made on the situation
in South Sudan. We believe, therefore, that we should
urge the Council to remain vigilant in seeing those
steps implemented in close cooperation with all of the
regional organizations involved in issues related to
South Sudan.
