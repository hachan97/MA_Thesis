The President: I thank Mr. Sy for the
clarifications he has provided.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council will continue its
consideration of this item at a meeting to be held
immediately following the adjournment of this
meeting. I would therefore like to urge members of the
Council to remain seated as we move immediately to
adopt the presidential statement.

The meeting rose at 1.10pm.
