Mr. Chen Xu (China) (spoke in Chinese): The
Chinese delegation has always supported the efforts made
by the United Nations to assist the Haitian people to
overcome their political crisis and begin economic
reconstruction. We appreciate the efforts made by the
Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH) and the
International Civilian Mission in Haiti (MICIVIH) in
assisting the Haitian people in their reconstruction efforts.
We have noted that President Preval of Haiti, in his letter
dated 8 November, expressed hope that the United Nations
would continue to support the peace process in Haiti and
set up a new mission at an early date. In this regard, we
support the proposal of the Secretary-General to set up the
International Civilian Support Mission in Haiti (MICAH).
We hope that the General Assembly will take a decision on
a relevant resolution at an early date.

We believe that when the overall situation in Haiti is
stable, the United Nations should focus its efforts on
helping Haiti to fight poverty and restore its economy.
Therefore, we have always held the View that, given the
overall situation, MIPONUH should consider completing its
work so that the relevant agencies can play a greater role in
peace-building.

We have just voted in favour of extending MIPONUH
by three months in consideration of the fact that there is a
need for a smooth transition from MIPONUH to MICAH.

We sincerely hope that Haiti will be able to maintain
stability and, with the assistance of the international
community, will stride forward towards the early
achievement of peace, stability and development.
