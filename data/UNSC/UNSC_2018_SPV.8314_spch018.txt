The President: I would like to make a further
statement in my capacity as the representative
of Sweden.

We spend an inordinate amount of time in the
Chamber discussing devastating crises on the African
continent. However, today's meeting has provided
a welcome opportunity to focus on cooperation and
solutions and on how our joint efforts can yield better
results. I am very encouraged by the resounding support
we have heard today for a deepened strategic partnership
between the United Nations and the African Union.

It is clear that enhanced collaboration is part and
parcel of ongoing efforts to make peace operations
more effective. In order to foster such collaboration,
further discussion is required on the modalities for
much needed predictable financing. It was encouraging
to hear from Ms. Sahle-Work Zewde and Commissioner
Chergui about the magnitude of activities, exchanges
and collaborative efforts between the two secretariats
in an effort to operationalize closer cooperation. Such
endeavours deserve our full support. That momentum
must continue in order to achieve results. I believe
that it all bodes very well for the twelfth annual joint
consultative meeting to be held tomorrow with the
African Union Peace and Security Council.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Security Council.

There are no more names inscribed on the list
of speakers.

The meeting rose at 5.30pm.
