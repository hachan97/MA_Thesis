The President (spoke in Chinese): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of China.

I thank Special Representative of the Secretary-
General De Mistura for his briefing and Ambassador
Tanin for his statement.

At present, peaceful reconstruction in Afghanistan
is at a critical stage. China supports the Kabul process.
Work in Afghanistan in the fields of political stability,
security, development and the rule of law should go
hand in hand so that Afghan ownership can be achieved
at an early date.

China congratulates the country on the
inauguration of the Lower House of the National
Assembly. We support the efforts of the Afghan
Government to enhance its capacity-building and to
promote the Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration
Programme while implementing relevant Council
resolutions.

China is very concerned over the recent and
frequent occurrence of security incidents and the rising
civilian casualties. The transfer of security responsibility
to the Afghan Government should be preceded by
ensuring the country's safety and stability. The
international community should, on the basis of respect
for Afghanistan's independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity, honour its commitments to
Afghanistan and continue to provide it with assistance.
China supports the central role of the United Nations
Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) in
coordinating the assistance of the international
community in reconstructing Afghanistan and
effectively achieving Afghan ownership. We endorse
the extension of UNAMA's mandate for an additional
12 months. The Council should attach due importance
to Afghanistan's request that it extend UNAMA's
mandate.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Italy.
