Mr. Vassilenko (Kazakhstan) (spoke in Russian):
We were saddened to learn yesterday of the untimely
passing of Vitaly Ivanovich Churkin, Permanent
Representative of the Russian Federation to the United
Nations. On behalf of Minister Kairat Abdrakhmanov
and the entire Ministry of Foreign Affairs of
Kazakhstan, we convey to him our deepest condolences
to the bereaved family and to the Russian delegation on
the passing of such a brilliant diplomat.

Vitaly Ivanovich Churkin was an outstanding
individual who defended the interests of his country
and made a significant contribution to strengthening
the principles of multilateral diplomacy. Saddened by
the news, our Minister, who used to be the Permanent
Representative of Kazakhstan to the United Nations,
said:

"The passing of Vitaly Ivanovich, with whom I
worked for the past three years in the United Nations, is
for me a personal tragedy. It is an intolerable loss for the
whole diplomatic corps. He was an outstanding person,
a good friend, a reliable ally and a true professional.
We shall always remember him. May he rest in peace."
