Mr. Tillerson (United States of America): I would
like to take a moment to respond to the statements made
by the Permanent Representative of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea.

First, I think we have heard all of these things
before from that Government. There is no doubt that the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea's pursuit of a
nuclear arsenal is in clear violation of international law,
directly challenges the global non-proliferation regime
and greatly threatens international peace and security.

This organ has unanimously made those points for
well over a decade now. The international community
condemns North Korea's pursuit of a nuclear arsenal,
and we will never accept a nuclear North Korea. The
Democratic People's Republic of Korea's unlawful acts
cannot be ignored, nor can they be explained away. The
Democratic People's Republic of Korea must be held
accountable for its actions.

In that regard, in response to any notion that the
source of tensions on the peninsula are the fault of no
one party, there is but one party that has carried out
illegal detonations of nuclear devices. There is but one
party that continues to launch intercontinental ballistic
missiles in violation of Security Council resolutions,
overflying another sovereign nation - Japan - and
threatening civil aviation security because, as those
launches are undertaken with no notification. There is
but one party that has been targeted with punishment
and penalties through the most vigorous sanctions
regime ever enacted, and that is the Kim Jong Un
regime in North Korea. They alone are responsible for
these tensions, they alone must take responsibility for
these tensions and they alone can solve these tensions.
