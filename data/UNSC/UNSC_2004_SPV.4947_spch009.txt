Mr. Lucas (Angola): The people of Cyprus and
its constituent communities will, on 24 April,
experience a moment of challenge and faith. They are
called to decide on the foundation of a new State, the
end of a decades-long conflict, the establishment of
new relations between the two communities and the
international position of their country. Indeed, the
stakes are high for the people of Cyprus.

The Security Council was called on today to take
important decisions that would have an impact on
Cyprus after the referendums to be held on 24 April. It
is my delegation's view that the Security Council
should respond to the Secretary-General's request and
adopt the measures contained in the draft resolution
submitted to us. We share the expectation of the
Secretary-General that the draft resolution could have a
positive impact in the country and that it would
contribute to increasing the confidence of the people of
Cyprus and of the political leaders in the process in
which they are engaged. We also share the view of the
Secretary-General that an expression of support by the
United Nations for the security provisions of the draft
resolution would be a very important psychological
boost in the present context of challenge and
uncertainty.

Therefore, my delegation voted in favour of the
draft resolution fundamentally as an expression of
support for the efforts of the Secretary-General and for
the people of Cyprus in this decisive hour of its history.
