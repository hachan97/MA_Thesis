Mr. Llorentty Soliz (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): I will also be very brief. First of
all, allow me to thank Japan for introducing draft
resolution S/20l7/970, which was intended to provide
a solution to this difficult process. This morning
during consultations, we once again condemned the
use of chemical weapons and advocated for the need
of an independent and impartial investigation to
identify those responsible for those atrocity crimes.
Similarly, we expressed our concern about the lack
of communication among members of the Security
Council that has currently led us to exactly the same
situation as yesterday (see S/PV.8105).

We once can express our gratitude for the draft
proposal. We endorse many of its principles, but we
regret the fact that without the participation and input
of all actors, we will predictably repeat the same
scenario. In that vein, we believe that we continue to be
faced with the task of ensuring that the use of chemical
weapons in Syria or anywhere else is duly investigated.
We believe that the Council must continue to work on
this issue until we reach a full consensus so as to avoid
repeating the situations in which we find ourselves
today, and found ourselves yesterday.

My delegation therefore joins the representative of
Sweden in proposing that, at the end of this meeting,
we meet for informal consultations on the matter.
