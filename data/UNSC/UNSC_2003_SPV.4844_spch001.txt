The President: I join other Council members in
welcoming the presence of the Secretary-General,
Mr. Kofi Annan.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on the agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them

and the United States of America.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to the vote on the draft resolution. Unless I
hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to
the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chile, China,
France, Germany, Guinea, Mexico, Pakistan,
Russian Federation, Spain, Syrian Arab Republic,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, United States of America

The President: The draft resolution received 15
votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 1511 (2003).

I now give the floor to the Secretary-General.
