The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Turkey, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Pamir
(Turkey) took a seat at the Council table.

The President: I welcome the presence among us
of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations and the
agreement that the representative of Turkey should
have the opportunity to address the Council.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2004/792, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by France, Germany,
Romania, the Russian Federation, China, Spain, the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and the United States of America.

I shall now give the floor to the representative of
Turkey.
