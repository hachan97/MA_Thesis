Mr. Moncada (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): It is an honour for the Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela to take the floor on behalf of
the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) at this open debate
on a matter to which we attach great importance,
taking into account the fact that 88 per cent of
peacekeeping personnel deployed in the field come
from non-aligned countries.

At the outset, we would like to convey, on behalf of
the States members of the Movement, our best wishes
to the delegation of the Arab Republic of Egypt for
a successful month in the conduct of the work of the
Council, as well as our appreciation for its efforts in
preparing the concept paper (S/2017/692, annex) for
this meeting. We would also like to acknowledge the
diligence with which the delegation of the People's
Republic of China carried out the work of this organ
in July.

Likewise, we should like to thank Her Excellency
Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed;
Mr. Youssef Mahmoud, Senior Adviser at the
International Peace Institute; and Ambassador Gert
Rosenthal, former Chair of the Advisory Group
of Experts on the Review of the United Nations
Peacebuilding Architecture, for their valuable briefings.

The States members of the Movement reiterate
their commitment to the promotion of the peaceful
settlement of disputes, in accordance with Article 2
and Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,
as well as with relevant United Nations resolutions and
international law as a whole, in order to contribute to
strengthening international peace and security and
to save future generations from the scourge of war,
including by strengthening the role of the United
Nations in the peaceful settlement of disputes, conflict
prevention and resolution, confidence-building,
national reconciliation, post-conflict peacebuilding,
rehabilitation, reconstruction and development.

In that regard, we stress that, in the context of
a comprehensive approach and the objective of a
lasting peace and security, the implementation of all
tasks mandated to peacekeeping operations should be
supported and accompanied by aparallel, comprehensive
and inclusive peace process that is well planned and
carefully designed and based on national ownership
and the support of the international community, as well
as the consent and compliance ofthe parties concerned.
In that respect, I would refer to resolution 2086 (2013),
which was welcomed by the Movement, with its
particular focus on multidimensional peacekeeping as
an important contribution to pursuing a comprehensive,
coherent and integrated approach to multidimensional
peacekeeping and post-conflict peacebuilding.

At the seventeenth Summit of the Non-Aligned
Movement, held in September 2016 on Margarita island,
Venezuela, the Heads of State and Government stressed
that United Nations peacekeeping operations must not
be used as a substitute for addressing the root causes
of conflict, which should be addressed in a coherent,
well-planned, coordinated and comprehensive manner,
together with other political, social, economic and
developmental instruments. They further stressed
that due consideration should be given by the United
Nations to the manner in which those efforts can be
carried out from the early stage of United Nations
engagement in post-conflict situations and continue
without interruption after the departure of peacekeeping
operations, so as to ensure a smooth transition to lasting
peace and security and sustainable development. In that
context, they stressed the need to improve synergies
between peacekeeping and peacebuilding activities so
as to attain the overall objective of sustainable peace.
Our position is of great relevance, taking
into account that, in most cases, the structural
causes of conflicts include, among others, poverty,
hunger, inequalities - including those related to
gender - violations of human rights and fundamental
freedoms, injustice, lack of jobs and access to
education, poor accountability and mismanagement
of natural resources, all of which are core elements of
a comprehensive approach specifically to achieving
sustainable peace.

On that occasion, the Heads ofState and Government
also reaffirmed the Movement's principled position on
peacekeeping operations, which must be carried out
with strict adherence to the purposes and principles
enshrined in the Charter ofthe United Nations. They also
emphasized that respect for the principles ofsovereignty,
territorial integrity and independence of States, as well
as non-intervention in internal affairs, are key elements
of joint efforts in the promotion of international peace
and security. In that regard, they reiterated that respect
for the basic principles of peacekeeping - namely, the
consent of the parties, impartiality and non-use of force
except in self-defence - is essential to the success of
peacekeeping operations.

Preserving, promoting, achieving and maintaining
international peace and security should remain key
priorities of the United Nations agenda, which is why
the international community must spare no effort in
the fields of conflict prevention and sustaining peace.
Therefore, preventing the outbreak, continuation or
recurrence ofconflict is a collective responsibility. Most
important of all, however, it is a national responsibility
that could at times benefit from the objective, impartial
and supportive assistance that the United Nations is
able to provide, upon request and in partnership with
regional and subregional organizations and other
relevant actors, as appropriate.

Moreover, while recognizing that there are various
tools available to the international community and
the United Nations for ensuring the maintenance of
international peace and security, including preventive
diplomacy, the Non-Aligned Movement stresses the
importance of using such tools in good faith, and
not as a tool for interfering in the internal affairs of
Member States, in strict compliance with the principles
of international law concerning friendly relations and
cooperation among States, in accordance with the
Charter of the United Nations. We also emphasize the
need to include and involve all sectors of society in
peace processes, including women and youth, who can
play an important role in the prevention and resolution of
conflicts, as well as in peacekeeping and peacebuilding
efforts and in building peaceful and resilient societies.

The Non-Aligned Movement has taken note of the
Secretary-General's peace and security architecture
reform initiative, which has a particular focus on
enhancing the meaningful interface between United
Nations political efforts and peacekeeping operations
on the ground. The need to change compartmentalized
thinking within the Organization must not be
minimized, including in order for peacekeeping
mandates and operations to be well calibrated with the
broader political and development objectives necessary
for sustaining peace.

In that connection, the States members of the
Movement reiterate the importance they attach to the
deliberations and report of the annual substantive
session of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping
Operations, which is the only United Nations forum
mandated to comprehensively review the whole
question ofpeacekeeping operations in all their aspects,
and refer to the observations and recommendations
reached through consensus in this year's report on
the potential contribution of peacekeeping operations
to peacebuilding and sustaining peace. In that regard,
we recognize the need for further awareness-raising of
personnel deployed in peacekeeping missions about the
evolving policy discussions and approaches regarding
the field. The Movement also stresses the need for a
structural and predictable approach to the triangular
consultations among the Security Council, the troop-
and police-contributing countries and the Secretariat,
with a view to leveraging the potential of peacekeeping
mandates and operations for sustaining peace.

To conclude, the Non-Aligned Movement looks
forward to the Secretary-General's report on sustaining
peace with specific recommendations on, inter alia,
how peacekeeping operations can better serve the
comprehensive approach of sustaining peace, including
during transitions. The Movement wishes to see creative
and forward-looking recommendations, particularly on
increased, sustainable and predictable resources for
sustaining peace, including by enhancing the efficiency
of peacekeeping operations, as part of the broad-based
framework for sustaining peace in response to the
shifting realities on the ground.
