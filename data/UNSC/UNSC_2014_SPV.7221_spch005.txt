Mrs. ngu (Nigeria): In our intervention last
Friday during the briefing on the downing of Malaysia
Airlines Flight MH-l7 over Ukraine on 17 July (see S/PV.7219), we noted that the tragic and unfortunate
incident could potentially mark a new dimension in the
Ukrainian crisis that represented a grave threat to the
safety of international civil aviation. That new global
threat spurs us to consider what insecurity means to the
human race. For that reason, we not only voted in favour
of resolution 2166 (2014) but also sponsored it. Respect
for international law, to the extent that it prohibits acts
that threaten the safety of international civil aviation, is
our guiding principle in the matter.

In adopting the resolution, the Council has once
again demonstrated that, when it is united in purpose,
it is capable of speaking with one voice in sending a
strong message on matters of international peace and
security. The resolution takes into account the concerns
not only of members of the Security Council but also of
well-intentioned nations around the world, in particular
States that lost citizens in the crash. Principal among those
concerns is the need for a comprehensive, thorough and
independent international investigation in accordance
with international civil aviation guidelines. It is
crucially important for the outcome of the investigation
to be credible and unimpeachable. In that regard, we
welcome the involvement of the International Civil
Aviation Organization, which has the appropriate
expertise to share with the parties involved in the
investigation.

No less significant is the question of accountability.
The Security Council has demanded that those responsible
for that heinous act be held accountable. We would
like to emphasize that it is the obligation of States to
cooperate fully in the efforts to find and to bring to
justice those responsible for this brazen act, which
violates not only international law but also the peace of
the human race.
