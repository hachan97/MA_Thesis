The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

After consultations among the members of the
Council, I have been authorized to make the following
statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council commends the Greek
Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders for the
political leadership they have shown and warmly
welcomes the progress made so far in the fully-
fledged negotiations, and the leaders' joint
statements.

"The Security Council strongly urges the
leaders to increase the momentum in the
negotiations to ensure the full exploitation of this
opportunity to reach a comprehensive settlement
based on a bicommunal, bizonal federation with
political equality, as set out in the relevant
Security Council resolutions.
"The Security Council emphasizes the
importance of all parties engaging fully, flexibly
and constructively and looks forward to decisive
progress in the negotiations in the near future.

"The Security Council recognizes that a
solution requires the support of both sides and
will require the approval of both communities in
separate and simultaneous referenda. In this
context, the Security Council fully supports the
Secretary-General's Good Offices Mission and
encourages the Secretary-General's Special
Adviser to continue to offer the leaders any
support they need to achieve a settlement.

"The Security Council reiterates its full
support for the process and underlines the
benefits that reunification will bring to the
island."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2009/10.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
