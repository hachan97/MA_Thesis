The President (spoke in Spanish): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Luis Moreno-
Ocampo, Prosecutor of the International Criminal
Court.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Moreno-Ocampo to take a seat at the
Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members
to document S/2010/265, which contains a letter dated
28 May 2010 from the Secretary-General addressed to
the President of the Security Council.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Luis Moreno-Ocampo, to whom I give
the floor.
