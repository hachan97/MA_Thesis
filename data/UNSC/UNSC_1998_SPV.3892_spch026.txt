Mr. Essonghe (Gabon) (interpretation from French):
I would first of all like to pay tribute to the Secretary-
General for the quality of his report of 10 June 1998
(S/l998/491). The content of that report allows us to
gauge all aspects of the progress made in the resolution
of the conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Indeed, we have noted with satisfaction the progress
made by the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and
Herzegovina (UNMIBH) in the training of local police, as
well as in implementing the programme of restructuring
those forces. These noteworthy advances clearly
demonstrate that the pertinent resolutions of the Security
Council have been taken into account and have been
implemented by all the international actors involved in the
quest for a solution to this crisis. I am thinking in
particular of paragraph 5 of resolution 1144 (1997) of 19
December 1997, which reads as follows:

"Urges also Member States to provide training,
equipment and related assistance for local police
forces in coordination with the IPTF, recognizing
that resources are critical to the success of the police
reform efforts of the IPTF".

 

Nevertheless, serious obstacles stemming from
disagreements between the Croatian authorities and
UNMIBH at various levels are likely to jeopardize the
peace process, as is the increase in recent months of violent
incidents aimed at refugees and displaced persons,
particularly at members of minority groups. In this
connection, we urge all the parties to cooperate unfailingly
with UNMIBH in order to contribute to the full
achievement of the objectives of the Peace Agreement and
to ensure the security of the Mission's personnel.

It is only through sustained dialogue and mutual
concessions that the parties in conflict in Bosnia and
Herzegovina will be able to achieve a lasting political
settlement. My delegation will vote in favour of the draft
resolution before us in order to support the efforts of
UNMIBH.
