The President (interpretation from Spanish): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the note by
the Secretary-General contained in document S/ 1997/774
transmitting the report of the Executive Chairman on the
activities of the Special Commission established by the
Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 9 (b) (i) of
Security Council resolution 687 (1991).

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/1997/816, which contains the text of the draft
resolution submitted by Chile, Costa Rica, Japan, Poland,
Portugal, the Republic of Korea, Sweden, the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the
United States of America.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless I hear any
objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements before the voting.
