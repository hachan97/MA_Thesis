Mr. Kennedy: I thank the members of the
Council for their keen interest in the humanitarian
situation in Liberia. This goes directly to the question
raised by the representative of Singapore: what can be
done to highlight the humanitarian concerns in Liberia
and what can be done to keep and expand the
humanitarian presence there? I would offer three
thoughts.

The first concerns resources. The money sought
by non-governmental organizations and United Nations
agencies for Liberia is relatively modest. But, as
indicated in the Secretary-General's report, the
response has been even more modest. We need the
support of donor Governments. Later this month in
Geneva, on 27 November, we will launch the
consolidated appeal for Liberia. We would encourage
the Council's support and generosity.

The second item, which I think is a good
example, is last week's Arria Formula meeting on
Liberia. We need increased visibility and advocacy for
the people of Liberia. I think that, because of its long-
standing nature and the fact that other new crises are
crowding the agenda, the humanitarian situation there
tends to be forgotten and overlooked. We cannot forget
the tens of thousands of people there who are in dire
shape and need continued assistance.

Lastly, I think we need, as indicated in the report,
the right kind of environment in Liberia to deliver
assistance. The anti-sanctions campaign, with its
knock-on effects on the environment for agencies and
non-governmental organizations, is not helpful and
needs to be changed so that there is an enabling
environment for non-governmental organizations and
United Nations agencies to operate and keep a presence
there.

In response to the question by the representative
of the United States, on the difference between the
humanitarian situation before the imposition of
sanctions, in March this year, and since, I think that,
simply put, the humanitarian situation was abysmal
prior to March 2001, and it remains abysmal today.
