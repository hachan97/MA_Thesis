Mr. Mohamed (Somalia): First of all,
Mr. President, let me thank you and your able team for
your work in the presidency of the Security Council for
the month of June.

I am not here to make a statement but rather to
deliver a brief message on behalf of the highest level of
the Somali Government.

Somalia attaches great importance to the issue of
piracy. We welcome the Secretary-General's report
(S/2011/360), and we greatly appreciate the
comprehensive briefing by Patricia O'Brien and the
work she and her team perform. But due to recent
political developments on Somalia, culminating in a
peace agreement brokered by the President of Uganda
and the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General, Mr. Mahiga, and ultimately the resignation of
the Prime Minister of Somalia last week, Somalia
unfortunately does not have the time or energy to
digest the report.

Still, at the same time, we want to reiterate to the
Council the utmost importance we attach to piracy. As
soon as we form a new government - and the President of
Somalia is going to appoint a new Prime Minister and
council of ministers very soon, possibly as early as this
week or next week - as soon as we complete the
process of forming a new government of Somalia, we
will provide our input and advice to the Council
regarding the report. We look forward to working with
the Council and Patricia O'Brien on the way forward
on this issue, but in the meantime I reiterate the great
importance Somalia attaches to the issue of piracy.
