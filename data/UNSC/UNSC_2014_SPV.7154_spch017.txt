Mr. Llanos (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): We would like
to thank Assistant Secretary-General Oscar Fernandez-
Taranco for his briefing and welcome the convening of
this meeting at this critical time for Ukraine and the
region. We face a sensitive development in the crisis in
Ukraine. Chile regrets the outbreaks of violence seen in
the eastern regions, specifically in Donetsk, Luhansk
and Kharkiv, and expresses its deep concern over the
serious consequences of the escalation of the crisis
owing to the actions of separatist groups.

It is critical that the parties exercise the maximum
restraint in order to contain the crisis. Our country once
again reiterates the need to respect the sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine. We
also reaffirm the obligation incumbent on Members
of the United Nations to refrain from resorting to the
threat of or use of force against the territorial integrity
and political independence of any State. It is urgent that
all parties involved refrain from undertaking actions
that are contrary to the provisions of the Charter of the
United Nations and the international agreements and
treaties to which Ukraine is a party.

We once again call on the parties to seek a
peaceful solution to the crisis through direct political
dialogue, to refrain from taking unilateral measures
and to support international mediation initiatives, in
accordance with General Assembly resolution 68/262.
That process must be inclusive and must ensure the rule
of law, human rights, fundamental freedoms and full
respect for the rights of minorities. In that context, the
role of the Security Council, the Secretary-General, his
Special Envoy and regional organizations continues to
be fundamental.
