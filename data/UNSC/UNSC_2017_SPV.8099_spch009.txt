Mr. Bermudez (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish):
Uruguay believes that the sanctions regime continues to
play a vital role in the promotion of peace and stability
in the Horn of Africa.

In Somalia, the regime is curbing the illicit
arms flow and cutting the financing of Al-Shabaab.
Uruguay has followed the situation in the Horn of
Africa closely and welcomes the progress made by
the Federal Government of Somalia. We congratulate
the African Union and the countries of the region for
their contribution in the fight against the Al-Shabaab
terrorist group, and we appeal to the international
community to continue to help Somalia in its efforts.

As for Eritrea, the Government of Eritrea must
still allow the Monitoring Group to visit the country.
Although in its report (S/2OI7/925) the Monitoring
Group on Somalia and Eritrea highlights the fact that
for the fourth consecutive year no conclusive evidence
of Eritrean support for Al-Shabaab in Somalia has been
found, Uruguay believes that if Eritrea were to allow
the Monitoring Group to visit the country, verify the
lack of support for armed groups and ascertain the fate
of prisoners of war, the Council would be in a position
to reconsider delisting Eritrea from the sanctions list.

Nevertheless, it is important for the Security
Council to begin to consider and develop other working
methods that will allow us to unblock the situation and
move forward towards the resolution of conflicts in the
Horn of Africa, keeping in mind that sanctions are a
means and not an end in and of themselves. As such,
the resolution addresses the sanctions regime imposed
on Somalia and does not dissociate the two regimes.
Voting against it would have called into question the
sanctions regime currently in force for Somalia. For
that reason Uruguay voted in favour of the proposal.
