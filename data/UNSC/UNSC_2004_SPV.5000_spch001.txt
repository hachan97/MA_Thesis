The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to His Excellency Sir Emyr Jones Parry,
head of the Security Council mission to West Africa.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

I would like to welcome the return of the
members of the Council and of the Secretariat who
took part in the mission to West Africa.

I would like now to give the floor to Sir Emyr
Jones Parry, head of the Security Council mission to
West Africa.
