The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Cuba, in which he has requested to be
invited to participate. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Rodriguez
Parrilla (Cuba) took the seat reservedfor him at
the side ofthe Council Chamber.

The President: The next speaker inscribed on my
list is the representative of Sierra Leone. I invite him to
take a seat at the Council table and to make his
statement.
