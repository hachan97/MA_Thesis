Mrs. Craft (United States of America): I first want
to note how pleased I am to be here today with all of
the Security Council members in the Chamber today,
assuming my duties at the United States Mission to the
United Nations. I thank my Council colleagues for all
their warm welcomes.

The United States welcome to unanimous adoption
of resolution 2488 (2019) today, which relaxes the arms
embargo on the Government of the Central African
Republic and commits to revisiting the sanctions
regime in four months. My country recognizes that
armed groups continue to violate the arms embargo
with impunity, and we urge the region to end the arms
trafficking that undermines the national security of the
Central African Republic. We recognize that progress
has been made by the Government and will continue
our bilateral support to help the authorities achieve the
United Nations benchmarks.

We look forward to working with other members
of the Council, the Central African Republic, its
Government and the United Nations to support the
implementation of the Political Agreement for Peace
and Reconciliation in the Central African Republic of
6 February and the further extension of State control
over the entire territory of the country. The irresponsible
flooding of arms into a desperately poor and divided
country would only increase the likelihood of a return
to widespread bloodshed and violence. This is not what
anyone wants.
