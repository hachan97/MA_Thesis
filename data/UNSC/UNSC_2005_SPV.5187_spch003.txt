The President: I thank the Deputy Secretary-
General for her statement.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers
to limit their statements to no more than five minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate the text in writing and to
deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.

I now give the floor to the representative of New
Zealand. On behalf of the Security Council I extend a
warm welcome to His Excellency, Mr. Phil Goff,
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade of New Zealand.
