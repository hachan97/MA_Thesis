The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Mr. Toole for his comments.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Council will remain seized of this
important matter.

The meeting rose at 6.30pm.
