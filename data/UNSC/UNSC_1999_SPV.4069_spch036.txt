Mr. Izetbegovic (Bosnia and Herzegovina): I would
like to express to you, Mr. President, my sincere
appreciation for giving me the opportunity to address the
Security Council today. I have listened very carefully to the
statements of the States members of the Security Council.
They all expressed their support for our country, and I
thank all of them. I would like to reiterate my full support
for the New York Declaration and will do everything
possible to ensure its implementation.
