The President (spoke in Russian): The
coordinating role of the Under-Secretary-General for
Peacekeeping can only have a very strong impression
on Council members. The presidency of the Security
Council fully agrees with the procedure he has
proposed, and I believe that other members are in
agreement as well.

I shall now give the floor to Lieutenant General
Afzal, pursuant to rule 39 of the provisional rules of
procedure of the Security Council, to respond to
comments and questions raised.
