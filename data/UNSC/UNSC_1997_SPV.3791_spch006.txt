Mr. Wang Xuexian (China) (interpretation from Chinese): The Charter of the United Nations clearly
stipulates that the United Nations should not interfere in
what are essentially the internal affairs of a State. In our
view, the question of Albania is in essence an Albanian
internal affair. Therefore, the Security Council should
proceed with caution.

We are not in favour of authorizing the deployment
in Albania of the multinational protection force. We are
even less in favour of expanding the force's mandate.
Moreover, we feel that, as the situation in Albania
improves, the multinational protection force should
terminate its mandate at an appropriate time.

The understanding of the Chinese delegation is that
the deployment of the multinational protection force in
Albania is a special measure taken under special
circumstances. Taking into account the relevant request of
the Albanian Government for the extension of the force's
mandate, the Chinese delegation will not stand in the way
of the adoption of the draft resolution. However, I wish
to stress that safeguarding the purposes and principles of
the United Nations Charter is in the fundamental and
long-term interests of the countries of the world.

In the long run, the question of Albania can be
resolved only by the Albanian people themselves. We
sincerely hope that the Government and people of Albania
will make joint efforts to ensure that peace and stability
return to their country as soon as possible.
