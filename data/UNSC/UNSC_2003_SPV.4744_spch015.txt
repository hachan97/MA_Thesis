Mr. Williamson (United States of America): I
thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General, Mr. Sharma, for his report. The United States
is pleased that the predicted increase in violence in
Timor-Leste has not materialized. We applaud the
helpful role played by Indonesia. We encourage
Timor-Leste and Indonesia to finalize their border by
the targeted date.

We strongly support the adjustments to the United
Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET)
approved by the Security Council, including
strengthening the capacity of the Timor-Leste police
force. The liquidation task force, under Special
Representative Sharma, demonstrates good planning.
We support the final l2-month extension for
UNMISET.
