The President: I thank the representative of
Indonesia for his comments, which I greatly appreciate.

We have 12 speakers remaining on the list for the
closing section of this meeting. Before we continue with
the list, I would like to invite Dr. Peter Piot to respond on
behalf of the World Bank, the United Nations
Development Programme and the Joint United Nations
Programme on HIV/AIDS to what he has heard so far
today, reserving the right, of course, for him to make
additional comments after he has heard the remaining
speakers.
