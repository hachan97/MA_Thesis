Mr. van Walsum (Netherlands): I can subscribe to
just about everything that Ambassador Holbrooke said,
especially his comments that it is not a question of
whether we support peacekeeping, but when and how.
That is precisely the position of the Netherlands, too.

Just for the record, I would like to add two
observations. First, I have not yet mentioned the fact that
the Netherlands, too, is greatly pleased by the fact that
former President Masire has accepted the job, and has
been accepted, as facilitator in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo.

Finally, I would like to mention the fact that the
Netherlands has made approximately $200,000 available
to the Organization of African Unity for the Joint Military
Commission. There is no conditionality involved here,
but, when Mr. Miyet said that the next meeting of the
Joint Military Commission would take place on 20
January, it occurred to me that it might be conceivable to
ask it to step up the frequency of its meetings a little.
