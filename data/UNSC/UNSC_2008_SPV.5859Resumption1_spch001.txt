The President (spoke in Russian): I wish to
remind all speakers that, as I indicated at the morning
meeting and in accordance with the understanding
reached among members of the Council, they should
limit their statements to no more than five minutes in
order to expedite the Council's work. Delegations with
lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate
their texts in writing and to deliver a condensed
version when speaking in the Chamber.

The next speaker on my list is the representative
of Lebanon, to whom I give the floor.
