Mr. Popolizio Bardales (Peru) (spoke in Spanish):
Peru shares the assessment and concern of the United
Nations regarding the serious humanitarian crisis
across much of Syrian territory, and we therefore
support all initiatives that contribute to protecting its
people. We thank the delegations of Germany, Belgium
and Kuwait, in their capacity as co-penholders for
humanitarian issues in Syria, for their tireless efforts
to reach a compromise that would be acceptable to all
members of the Security Council regarding the content
of the draft resolution (S/20l9/96l) that was submitted
for consideration this afternoon.

We also welcome the transparency and openness
that they brought to this complex negotiating process, in
which we constructively participated with the purpose
of preserving a system on which the lives of millions
of people depend. Peru's actions on this item and other

items on the agenda of the Security Council have been
aimed principally at protecting civilians in accordance
with international humanitarian law. Our approach,
which is reflected in the content and provisions of the
draft resolution, underpinned our vote in favour of it.

Consequently, Peru deeply regrets that we were
unable to adopt the draft resolution presented by the
co-penholders, which we View as balanced, timely and
essential. We reiterate the need for the Council, and
its permanent members in particular, to recover their
sense ofunity on this very sensitive issue, which is vital
to meeting the heavy responsibilities entrusted to us.
