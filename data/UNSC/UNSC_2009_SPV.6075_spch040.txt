Mr. Le Roy (spoke in French): Given the time, I
will be very brief. I would simply say that this debate
makes those of us in the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations (DPKO) and the Department of Field
Support (DFS) optimistic on the collective willingness
to work on questions that concern us all. I was very
pleased to see that the challenges that we are facing
were mentioned by all of the speakers and that
everyone is ready to carry out some soul-searching,
including the Security Council, just as those of us in
DPKO and DFS are. I am very pleased to see that many
speakers are ready to work on this, including Canada,
of course; Japan through the revitalization of the
Security Council Working Group on Peacekeeping
Operations; the African Union, which we have just
heard from; the European Union, which we heard from
earlier; the Non-Aligned Movement; and the troop-
contributing countries. I believe that this dialogue has
now begun. Everyone has expressed their concerns. We
have taken note of everyone's message.

Once again, I would like to thank France and the
United Kingdom for this initiative. We hope that it will
continue. I would like to reiterate that, for our part, we
are ready to provide the Council with our own internal
observations so that we can come up with
recommendations before the end of the summer. The
more complicated ones might be provided before the
end of the year, but before the summer, we hope that
there will be recommendations on the table, which will
be approved by the Council if possible, but also by the
various bodies of the General Assembly.
