The President: There are no further speakers
inscribed on my list. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you
all for your positive and constructive contributions to
this open debate. We in the presidency of the Council
are heartened by the thoughts, comments, suggestions
and, most of all, your support in making our theme a
truly relevant and meaningful one. We look forward to
similar future cooperation.
