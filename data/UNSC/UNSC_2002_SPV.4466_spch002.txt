Mr. Strommen (Norway): Let me, first of all,
congratulate you, Sir, on the excellent manner in which
you have conducted the presidency of the Security
Council during the month of January 2002. You
deserve our heartfelt thanks. We have chosen to
highlight briefly three points relating to the work of the
Council this month.

First, we welcome the focus on African issues,
notably reflected in the comprehensive public debate
on 29 January and in the decision to dispatch a Security
Council mission to Ethiopia and Eritrea next month in
support of the peace process between those two
neighbouring countries. I am pleased to confirm that
preparations for the mission are well under way in
close cooperation with the parties.

Secondly, we commend you, Sir, for the
transparency exercise undertaken during the month.

Finally, I ask your indulgence, Sir, and wish to
reiterate the desirability of brevity in our interventions
in order to facilitate a businesslike and interactive
meeting culture in the Council. We must be able to
encourage openness and transparency and at the same
time to make meetings in the Chamber and in the
consultation room as businesslike and result-oriented
as possible.
