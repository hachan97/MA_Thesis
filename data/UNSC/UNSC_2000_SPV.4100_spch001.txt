The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Australia, Belarus, Brazil, Egypt, Japan,
New Zealand, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, Singapore,
Slovenia, South Africa and Uruguay, in which they request
to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice,
I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of

Mr. Mahbubani (Singapore), Mr. Zbogar (Slovenia),
Mr. Kumalo (South Africa) and Mr. Pe'rez-Otermin
(Uruguay) took the seats reserved for them at the
side of the Council Chamber.

The President (spoke in Spanish): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall take
it that the Security Council agrees to extend an invitation
under rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure to
Ms. Catherine Bertini, Executive Director of the World
Food Programme, and to Mrs. Sylvie Junod, head of the
delegation of the International Committee of the Red Cross
to the United Nations.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.

I now call on the Deputy Secretary-General.
