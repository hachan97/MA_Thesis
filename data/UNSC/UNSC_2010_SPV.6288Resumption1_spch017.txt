The President (spoke in French): Following
consultations among the members of the Security
Council, I have been authorized to make the following
statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council reaffirms the
statements of its Presidents of 24 September 1999
(S/PRST/1999/28), 31 August 2001 (S/PRST/ 2001/21), 31 October 2002 (S/PRST/2002/30)
and 29 June 2007 (S/PRST/2007/24), and its
resolution 1209 (1998) of 19 November 1998,
welcomes all initiatives taken by Member States
following the adoption of the Programme of
Action by the United Nations Conference on the
Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in
All Its Aspects and takes note of the progress
towards an Arms Trade Treaty.

"The Security Council is gravely concerned
about the illicit manufacture, transfer and
circulation of small arms and light weapons and
their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled
spread in many regions of the world, particularly
in the subregion of Central Africa, which have a
wide range of humanitarian and socio-economic
consequences, in particular on the security of
civilians by fuelling armed conflict, which in turn
exacerbates the risks of gender-based violence
and the recruitment of child soldiers and poses a
serious threat to peace, reconciliation, safety,
security, stability and sustainable development at
the local, national, regional and international
levels.

"The Security Council, while
acknowledging the right of all States to
manufacture, import, export, transfer and retain
conventional arms for self-defence and security
needs consistent with international law and the
Charter of the United Nations, underlines the
vital importance of effective regulations and
controls of the transparent trade in small arms
and light weapons in order to prevent their illegal
diversion and re-export.

"The Security Council reiterates that
Member States should comply with existing arms
embargoes and export bans and take necessary
steps to effectively implement these measures
imposed by the Council in its relevant
resolutions.

"The Security Council is alarmed that illicit
transfers of small arms and light weapons in
contravention of arms embargoes and export
bans, to or by criminal organizations or other
irresponsible actors, including those suspected of
engaging in terrorist acts, are linked with illicit
trafficking of drugs, illegal exploitation of natural
resources and illicit trade in such resources. The
Security Council encourages all members that
have not yet done so to accede to, ratify and
implement the United Nations Convention against
Transnational Organized Crime and its protocols,
including the Protocol against the Illicit
Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms,

Their Parts and Components and Ammunition.

"The Security Council welcomes

the

various initiatives that are currently under way

within the subregion, notes the efforts to establish
a subregional register of small arms and
encourages the Central African countries to take
necessary measures to build up the capacity of
the Economic Community of Central African
States (ECCAS) through the establishment of a
subregional register of arms dealers as well as the
elaboration of a subregional legally binding
instrument on the control of small arms and light
weapons, their ammunitions and all equipments
that might serve for their manufacture.

"The Security Council reaffirms the
importance of addressing illicit arms trafficking,
in particular of small arms and light weapons,
through an approach of common and shared
responsibility, and encourages the States of the
subregion to fully implement relevant measures
adopted at the national, subregional, regional and
international levels and to consider appropriate
steps in this regard.

"The Security Council calls on the States of
the subregion to strengthen efforts to establish
mechanisms and regional networks among their
relevant authorities for information sharing to
combat the illicit circulation of and trafficking in
small arms and light weapons. The Council also
stresses the need for the States of the subregion to
strengthen their cooperation, including through
regional and subregional organizations, in
particular the African Union, in order to identify
and take appropriate measures against individuals
and entities that engage in illegal trafficking of
small arms and light weapons in the Central
African subregion.

"The Security Council emphasizes the need
for national authorities in the subregion to fully
participate in the practical implementation of the
Programme of Action, adopted on 20 July 2001,
by the United Nations Conference on the Illicit
Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Is
Aspects, and the International Instrument to
Enable States to Identify and Trace, in a Timely
and Reliable Manner, Illicit Small Arms and
Light Weapons, adopted on 8 December 2005,
and encourages Central African countries to
regularly submit national reports to the Secretary-
General, in accordance with the abovementioned
instrument.

"The Security Council encourages
Economic Community of Central African States
to assist Central African countries in ensuring the
effective implementation of arms embargoes
imposed by the Council and, in this context, to
establish measures such as inquiries into illicit
arms trafficking routes, the follow-up of possible
violations and cooperation in border monitoring,
in consultation with the countries concerned. In
this regard, the Security Council encourages the
committees in charge of monitoring arms
embargoes in Central African countries and
neighbouring countries, consistent with their
mandates, to continue to include in the annual
reports a substantive section on the
implementation of arms embargoes, on possible
violation of the measures reported to the
Committees and with recommendations, as
appropriate, for strengthening the effectiveness of
arms embargoes. This information could also be
shared with Interpol's International Weapons and
Explosives Tracking System.

"The Security Council encourages the
Committees in charge of monitoring arms
embargoes in Central African countries and
neighbouring countries, consistent with their
mandates, to establish channels of
communication with ECCAS, its member States
and the United Nations Standing Advisory
Committee on Security Questions in Central
Africa.

"The Security Council supports the action
of the United Nations missions present in the
subregion, consistent with their mandates, to
assist disarmament processes in the framework of
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration
10-28131

programmes, and calls upon international partners
to assist the Central African countries to build
and strengthen their capacities to set up and
implement measures relating to the prevention of
illicit proliferation of small arms and light
weapons, and the security and management of
stockpiles of arms, especially small arms and
light weapons.

"The Security Council recognizes the
importance of the forthcoming United Nations
Fourth Biennial Meeting of States to Consider the
Implementation of the Programme of Action to
Prevent, Combat, and Eradicate the Illicit Trade
in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its
Aspects, to be held in June 2010, and encourages
Member States, including those in the subregion
of Central Africa, to fully cooperate with the
Chair to ensure a successful outcome of this
Meeting.

"The Security Council encourages Member
States to undertake vigorous actions aimed at
restricting the supply of small arms and light
weapons and ammunitions to areas of instability
in Central Africa.

"The Security Council requests the
Secretary-General to take into account in his
biennial report, as a follow-up, the content of the
present presidential statement."

This statement will be issued as a Security
Council document under the symbol S/PRST/2010/6.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 4.50 17.111.
