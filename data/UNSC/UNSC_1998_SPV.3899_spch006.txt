Mr. Ag Oumar (Mali) (interpretation from French):
I wish on behalf of the Government of Mali to thank the
members of the Security Council and the Secretariat staff
for the minute of silence they just observed in memory of
a man who was first and foremost the pride of the people
of Mali and who died as he carried out his mandate.

I grow emotional as I think of how all of Mali feels
this loss. Africa, and the entire world, will also feel the
loss of Maitre Beye. The Deputy Secretary-General has
noted that there would always be those who said the
mission was not making enough progress; with Maitre
Beye's sense of optimism, Mali wishes that his work will
indeed be completed, with the determination of all
concerned. He left with optimism, and those who follow
him will inherit the optimism that he always maintained.

I thank the Permanent Representative of Angola for
the condolences he has just expressed. The condolences
are mutual, because Maitre Beye viewed Angola as his
second home. It has been said that Maitre Beye had no
one work-place; his work-place was wherever he was at
the moment - his bed, his car, his dining table.

It is the wish of the Government of Mali that Maitre
Beye's work for peace should be completed one day. That
would be the greatest tribute that the United Nations
could pay to Maitre Beye and to his memory.
