Mr. Menan (Togo) (spoke in French): Togo deeply
regrets that the Security Council was unable to agree
to adopt the draft resolution that was circulated today,
requesting a 12-month deferral of the proceedings
against the President and Deputy President of Kenya,
under article 16 of the Rome Statute, as requested by the
African States. Togo regrets that the Council remained
divided to the end on such a significant request of
capital importance to Africa.

My country nevertheless hopes that this
unfortunate day, on which the Security Council found
itself unable to reach a consensus even on giving the
benefit of the doubt to Africa, will not have a negative
impact on relations between Africa and the Security
Council. For Togo, the ongoing promotion of trust
between the African Union and the Security Council
remains necessary so as to promote and strengthen
peace and security in Africa. The mitigation of crises
and conflicts on the African continent depends on that
very trust, for the growing number of African issues
on the Council's agenda, which are referred to every
time Africa is discussed in the Chamber, should be no
cause forjoy or satisfaction for the Council, much less
for Africa.
