The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. Members of the Council have before them
document S/2003/60, which contains the text of a draft
resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations.

As international news unfortunately confirms, the
terrorist threat, because of its multifaceted and global
nature, cannot be eradicated unless the international
community, together, continues to mobilize actively
and in a lasting way against this scourge. The United
Nations has a central role to play in order to ensure
such mobilization. It is therefore fundamental that we
give it our full support. That is why France, which
holds the presidency of the Security Council during the
month of January, has taken the initiative to convene
this Council meeting at the ministerial level. I thank
you, fellow members, for your participation.

Our objective must be to maintain and to
strengthen the mobilization of all against terrorism. We
must also give new impetus to the struggle against this
scourge, and our debate today must contribute to that.
It should give us an opportunity to reflect on new
actions that might be necessary in order to attain that
objective.

I should like to remind participants that, as
agreed, we shall limit the length of our statements to a
maximum of five to seven minutes.

I now give the floor to the Secretary-General, His
Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan.
