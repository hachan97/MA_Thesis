Mr. J erandi (Tunisia) (spoke in F rench): I would first
of all like to thank Mr. Annabi for his comprehensive
presentation.

It seems clear that, despite some remaining difficulties,
the security situation is generally becoming more stable,
particularly with the decrease in militia activity. We would
like to underscore the goodwill displayed by the Indonesian
Government in its cooperation with the United Nations, and
the assistance it is providing for the return of refugees as a
result of the memorandum of understanding it signed on
refugee returns and border security issues.

The assistance of the international community in this
area is very important. It is also equally helpful in
reconstruction and in creating an economic environment
conducive to the return to normalcy. We congratulate the
United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor
(UNTAET) on the initiatives it has undertaken in various
areas through Mr. Vieira de Mello's know-how, particularly
in creating an environment favourable to investment and in
setting up micro-projects to create employment.

The entire political process in Timor in fact depends
on the solidity of the financial institutions. In this
connection, we think that United Nations and World Bank
disbursements should take place quickly given the
importance of funds in preventing an increase in social
tensions. My delegation believes that particular importance
should be given to this aspect.
