The President (spoke in French): I thank the
representative of Mali for his kind words addressed to
me and to my country, Benin.

There are no more speakers inscribed on my list.
I shall now give the floor to the Special Representative
of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed
Conflict, Mr. Olara Otunnu, to respond to comments
made and questions raised by speakers.
