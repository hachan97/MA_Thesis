Mr. Baali (Algeria): The draft resolution on the
situation in northern Gaza, which got much more than
the required majority, has been defeated by the veto.
We regret that such a balanced and credible text, which
merely called upon Israel to put an end to its military
operation, which causes so many human losses and so
much damage, has not gained the unanimous
endorsement of the Council.

By failing to take action, the Security Council is
failing its responsibilities. It is once again failing the
Palestinian people, and once again, it is sending the
wrong message to the world. It is confirming that when
it comes to Israel, the Security Council is unable to
take action, let alone under Chapter VII. It is
strengthening the impression that it is effective only
when it deals with Arab countries. The latest example
is resolution 1559 (2004), promptly adopted while
there was no threat whatsoever to international peace
and security.

The Council is causing more frustration,
disappointment and despair among the Palestinians and
all those that consider the Council to be the custodian
of international law and the protector of the weak.
More important, it is going to reinforce the sentiment
of impunity among the Israeli leaders, who will feel
emboldened to pursue and expand their military
operation in Gaza and elsewhere.

I thank all those that joined us in voting in favour
of the vetoed draft resolution. But let me say that it is a
sad day for the Palestinians, and it is a sad day for the
cause ofjustice.
