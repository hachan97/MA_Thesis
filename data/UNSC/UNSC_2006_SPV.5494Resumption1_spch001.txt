The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have just received letters
from the representatives of Benin and Israel, in which
they request to be invited to participate in the
consideration of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the consideration of the item without
the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, the
representatives of Benin and Israel took the seats
reserved for them at the side of the Council Chamber.

The President (spoke in French): I wish to
remind all speakers, as I indicated at this morning's
meeting, to limit their statements to no more than four
minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its
work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy
statements are kindly requested to circulate the texts in
writing and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking in the Chamber.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Uganda.
