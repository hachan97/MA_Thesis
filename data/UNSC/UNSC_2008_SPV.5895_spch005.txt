The President: I thank the Secretary-General for
his statement. I am sure that the whole Council wishes
him safety and success in his extremely important
mission in Myanmar. We wish him good luck and thank
him for his contribution this morning.

I am now very happy to invite the Minister for
Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Sierra
Leone, Her Excellency Mrs. Zainab Hawa Bangura, to
take the floor.
