The President: There are no more names inscribed
on the list of speakers.

Before adjourning the meeting, as this is the
last scheduled meeting of the Council for the month
of December, I would like to express the sincere
appreciation of the delegation of Japan to the members of
the Council, especially the Permanent Representatives
and their respective staff, and to the Secretariat for all
the support they have given us.

It has been a busy month indeed, and one in
which we rallied to consensus on several important
issues within our purview. We could not have done it
alone and without the hard work, support and positive
contributions of every delegation and the representatives
of the Secretariat, as well as of all relevant conference
service officers, interpreters and security staff.
As we end our presidency, I know that I speak
on behalf of the Council in wishing the delegation of
Kazakhstan good luck in the month of January. I would
like, on behalf of the Council, to express the sincere
appreciation to the six outgoing members, namely,
Egypt, Italy, Japan, Senegal, Ukraine and Uruguay.
I commend their hard work and contributions during
their terms on the Security Council.

The meeting rose at 2.30pm.
