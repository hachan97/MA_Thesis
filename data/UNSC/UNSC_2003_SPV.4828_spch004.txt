Mr. Pleuger (Germany): My delegation is
disappointed by the outcome of the voting. This voting
sends the wrong signal to the parties and gives rise to
the perception of the Security Council as not living up
to its responsibilities.

On behalf of my Government, I should like to
state that, in abstaining in the voting on the draft
resolution, my Government's View with regard to the
decision by the Israeli Government in principle to
expel the President of the Palestinian Authority,
Mr. Arafat, has not changed. My Government
continues to hold that the said decision in itself is
detrimental to the peace process and that putting the
decision into effect would entail the risk of further
destabilization.

We therefore once again call on the Israeli
Government to revoke its decision and reiterate the
importance of both parties exercising utmost restraint
at this crucial time for the Middle East peace process.
In our View, all efforts now should, more than ever
before, be directed at returning to the road map,
implementing it in good faith and strengthening the
Quartet.
