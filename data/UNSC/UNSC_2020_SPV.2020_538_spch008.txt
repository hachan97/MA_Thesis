We note that security dynamics in Darfur have remained mostly unchanged. Isolated incidents, as well as sporadic but small-scale clashes in Jebel Marra between the Sudanese armed forces and the Sudan Liberation Army of Abdul Wahid Al-Nur, who actually remains the main spoiler of the peace process, do not change the picture. Just recently, on 3 June, the Security Council decided on a future international presence in the Sudan by adopting resolution 2524 (2020), on the deployment of a new special mission, the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in the Sudan (UNITAMS). In its decision, the Security Council was guided, first of all, by the request of the Sudanese themselves for assistance during this important period for the country, transitioning from peacekeeping to peacebuilding. UNITAMS is called upon to strengthen the Sudan's national capacity in a number of important areas, including national reconciliation in Darfur, as well as to mobilize economic support for the upcoming reforms. The Mission's good offices are also pivotal in the context of the ongoing peace talks in Juba, during which specific modalities for stabilizing the country will be determined. Responding to the request of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union, the Security Council simultaneously, in resolution 2525 (2020), extended the mandate of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur until 31 December 2020 so that the drawdown of the joint United Nations-African Union peacekeeping operation may proceed in a calm and responsible manner. We believe that these recent decisions of the Council will support Khartoum precisely as the Sudanese themselves need and expect. The above applies equally to the process of bringing to justice those who are guilty of crimes in that country.
