Mr. Jerandi (Tunisia) (spoke in French): I wish
first to thank the President of the International
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY),
Judge Claude Jorda, for his clear briefing and for the
useful information he provided to members of the
Security Council on the important subject of the
International Criminal Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia.

We have carefully examined the report and the
recommendations of the Expert Group to Conduct a
Review of the Effective Operation and Functioning of
the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia
and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.
We have also taken note of the proposals offered by the
judges of the ICTY, which relate to the situation and
the future prospects of the Tribunal. We have some
preliminary comments in that connection.

We consider that the practical problems and
difficulties described so clearly by the Expert Group
and by the members of the Tribunal deserve
consideration. Procedural constraints and difficulties
relating to reducing the duration of trials are acute
questions. We consider that the judges' plan to improve
the functioning of the Tribunal should be studied in
depth by the competent bodies. Here, we support the
French proposal to establish an informal Security
Council working group which would receive
contributions by States Members of the United Nations
in the context of a discussion of ways to enhance the
effectiveness of the International Tribunal.

Let me stress the link between justice and
reconciliation. Members will agree that this is of great
importance for the future of the Balkans region and for
peaceful coexistence among all communities.
