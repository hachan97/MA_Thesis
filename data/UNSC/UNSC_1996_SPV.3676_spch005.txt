The President (interpretation from Arabic): I thank
the representative of Canada for the kind words he
addressed to me.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to vote on the draft resolution in document
S/1996/478. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the
draft resolution to the vote.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I shall first call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements before the voting.
