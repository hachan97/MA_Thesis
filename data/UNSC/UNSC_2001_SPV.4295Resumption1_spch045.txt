The President: I thank the representative of Iraq
for the kind words he addressed to me.

There are a number of speakers remaining on my
list. In view of the lateness of the hour, and with the
concurrence of the members of the Council, I intend to
suspend the meeting now. The meeting is suspended
until early next week. The time will be announced in
the Journal.

The meeting was suspended at 7pm.
