Mr. Radomski (Poland): I would like to thank
High Representative Izumi Nakamitsu for her briefing.

Poland has already expressed its grave concern
about the use of the nerve agent in the attempt to murder
Mr. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal on
4 March in Salisbury, United Kingdom.

The report of the Organization for the Prohibition
of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has confirmed the
findings of the British Porton Down laboratory on the
agent used in Salisbury. It clearly indicates that the
reaction of the international community in support of
the United Kingdom was appropriate. We are grateful
to the British Government for sharing, in the spirit of
transparency, the results of the technical assistance
visit. We also thank the OPCW leadership and the
technical assistance visit members for the outstanding
and professional work they have done in that regard.

Let me recall that the European Council has agreed
unanimously with the Government of the United
Kingdom's assessment that it is highly likely that the
Russian Federation is responsible for this incident.
In that situation, we repeat our call on Russia to
address the legitimate questions raised by the British
Government and now corroborated by the results of
the OPCW's technical assessment visit report, and to
provide immediate, full and complete disclosure to the
OPCW of any programme with relevance to the case.

Poland would like to restate its strong conviction
that those responsible for the use of chemical weapons
must be identified and held accountable. The incident
in Salisbury is yet another example of a violation of
international law and the provisions of the Chemical
Weapons Convention. As we have said many times,
no such act can be left unanswered since it not only
undermines the basic sense ofjustice, but also leads to
the erosion of the non-proliferation and disarmament
regimes, and in consequence undermines the security
of all of us.
