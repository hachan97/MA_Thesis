The President: I thank the Secretary General of
CARE International for his comments, and we
welcome in particular his concerns for accountability.

I shall now give the floor to the Vice President of
the International Centre for Transitional Justice,
Mr. Ian Martin, to respond to comments and questions
that may have been raised during the debate.
