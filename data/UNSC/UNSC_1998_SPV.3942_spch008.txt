Mr. Satoh (Japan): First, I would like to express our
deep appreciation for the efforts of Mrs. Ogata and the
staff of the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in tackling these
very difficult - increasingly difficult - issues. If I may
say so, as a fellow countryman, she is a source of pride
to us.

We have to face the reality of this issue. I share
Mrs. Ogata's assessment and her concern, and I want to
endorse what she said. I am glad that she touched upon
the question of the insecurity of staff, which is a very
important issue. We need to pursue further how to turn it
from a question of insecurity into a question of security.
I would particularly like to underline the fact that the
question of the security of staff working for UNHCR or
in other humanitarian activities could have a far-reaching
effect; since they are mixed with other victims of war,
refugees or displaced people, their protection could
eventually also work to protect the other people.
Therefore, this is a matter which we should pursue more
robustly in the coming years.

I was encouraged that Mrs. Ogata focused on
African matters, because Africa is yet another hot spot
with regard to refugee questions. She talked about the
need for a regional approach to a comprehensive
framework for Central Africa. The dilemma for us is that
the political support is lacking. My question is: Has she
any suggestions, based upon her own experience in the
field, on how to arouse anew political support for this sort
of regional approach in Africa?
