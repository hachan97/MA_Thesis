The President: I wish to comment on one thing that
Ambassador Wensley said, which is quite important. She
spoke of over-compartmentalization at the United Nations.
Nothing underlines more what we are trying to do than that
comment, because we are trying to break down those
compartmentalizations. With respect to the six undertakings
mentioned in Peter Piot's statements, we will also move in
that direction.
