The President: There are no more speakers on
my list.

Today's discussion has expressed a broad
welcome for the work of the mission. I think that there
are three conclusions which I might try to draw.

First, I would note the strong endorsement by
Council members of the recommendations set out in
the mission report. The task now is to work together to
mobilize the endeavours of the United Nations as a
whole, along with the countries of the region, to give
substance to those recommendations.

Secondly, let me stress the importance of the
elections process in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo and the need to respect the time-table and
address the security issues, including the persistent
threat to civilians posed by armed groups. That will be
the subject of a Council draft resolution.

Thirdly, there is a need to work closely with the
new Government of Burundi as it establishes itself and
moves forward towards a new, peaceful era. But
building peace is a process which will require a
commitment by all of us, not least by the United
Nations, in support of the efforts of the Government.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 11.20 am.
