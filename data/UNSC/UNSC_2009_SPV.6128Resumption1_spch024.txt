Mr. Donovan (United States of America):
Contrary to the statements the Security Council has
heard this afternoon, the United States has taken a
number of actions with respect to Luis Posada Carriles.
Most recently, the United States sought and obtained a
criminal indictment in United States federal court
charging Posada Carriles with violations of our
immigration laws. On 8 April 2009, new criminal
charges were brought against Posada Carriles in that
case, accusing him of lying about his involvement in
certain terrorist bombings in Havana, Cuba. The case is
currently scheduled for trial later this year.
