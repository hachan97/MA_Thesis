The President: There are a number of speakers still
remaining. In view of the lateness of the hour, I intend,
with the concurrence of the members of the Council, to
suspend the meeting now.

The meeting was suspended at 1.20 pm. and
resumed at 3.30 p.m.

The President: The next speaker is the
representative of New Zealand. I invite him to take a
seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
