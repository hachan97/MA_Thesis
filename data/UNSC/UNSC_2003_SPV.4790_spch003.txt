The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Mr. Guehenno for the information that he has given us.
The Council will now hear a briefing by Mr. Amos
Namanga Ngongi, the former Special Representative of
the Secretary-General for the Democratic Republic of
the Congo. Before I give him the floor, allow me, on
behalf of the members of the Council, to extend our
thanks once again to Mr. Ngongi for the dedication
with which he served the cause of peace in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo during his two
years of distinguished service in extremely difficult
circumstances. As the Secretary-General has noted,
Mr. Ngongi's tireless efforts contributed considerably
to the recent progress in the peace process in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo. I extend our
appreciation to him, and I give him the floor.
