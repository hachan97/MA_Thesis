Mr. Gharibi (Islamic Republic of Iran): It is
regrettable that the representative of the Israeli regime
misused the Council's time to raise issues irrelevant
to the important theme of today's debate, just for the
political purpose of defamation of other countries.
However, it is a thread-bare tactic, practiced by an
apartheid occupier who has no respect for international
humanitarian law. It accuses others to clearly divert
attention. The international community well remembers
how its reckless military machine massacred innocent
civilians, including a huge number of women and
children in Gaza less than a year ago - and not for the
first time.

Aware of the influence of media and to cover up
the atrocities, the aggressors concluded thatjournalists
and media workers should not be allowed any access to
conflict zones. But they went far beyond that. According
to available statistics, more than a dozen Palestinian
journalists were deliberately targeted and killed. That
is in addition of the high number of journalists who
were injured or arrested illegally and kept under cruel
conditions. In the digital age, however, it is hard to hide
bloody hands. It is time to demand accountability and
end impunity.
