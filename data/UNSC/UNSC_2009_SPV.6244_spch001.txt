The President (spoke in French): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Alan Doss,
Special Representative of the Secretary-General and
head of the United Nations Organization Mission in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Doss to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

I should like to draw the attention of Council
members to document S/2009/623, which contains the
thirtieth report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Alan Doss, to whom I now give the
floor.
