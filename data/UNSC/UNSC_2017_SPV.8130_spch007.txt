Mr. Rosselli Frieri (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish):
As on previous occasions, Uruguay voted in favour of
the holding ofthis meeting. Uruguay does not recognize
limitations when it comes to dealing with the issue of
human rights, either for reasons of the forum where it is
discussed or of deference to domestic jurisdiction. Full
and unconditional respect for human rights and their
promotion and protection, as well as accountability
when such rights are violated, are essential aspects of
the foreign policy of Uruguay.

It is still quite fresh in the memory of Uruguayans
that, during the military dictatorship we suffered
from during the 1970s and early 1980s, international
public opinion was the subject of intense pressure
owing to the Violations of human rights that were being
committed in my country. That pressure was key in
gradually breaking down the military dictatorship.
We Uruguayans cannot forget the solidarity expressed
by the international community in our darkest hours,
and we therefore insist that there is no limitation as to
where the issue of human rights can be addressed - for
reasons of either forum or national jurisdiction.
