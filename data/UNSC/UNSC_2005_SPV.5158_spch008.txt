Sir Emyr Jones Parry (United Kingdom):
Tonight, by this vote, the Security Council has acted to
ensure accountability for the grave crimes committed
in Darfur, and I hope to send a salutary warning to
anyone intending to commit any further such atrocities.

The United Kingdom welcomes the Council's
decision to refer the situation to the International
Criminal Court, which is for us the most efficient and
effective means available to deal with impunity and to
ensure justice for the people of Darfur.

Council members have deeply held differences of
View on the issue of the International Criminal Court,
which makes the agreement reached today all the more
welcome and important. Our discussions have been
characterized on all sides by a high degree of
commitment and mutual comprehension, and a
readiness to cooperate. This outcome will, we hope,
serve as a basis for Council decisions on future such
occasions and will as such create a durable and
generally acceptable basis on which to proceed.

The Council must continue tackling the conflict
in Darfur as part of an integrated strategy for dealing
with the Sudan as a whole. We therefore welcome the
recent adoption of the resolutions on the peace support
operation and on measures. We must increase our
support for the African Union mission, which is
playing such an important role in Darfur. The
Secretary-General's report, requested by the Council in
resolution 1590 (2005), will be an important element in
taking forward this vital agenda.

We must redouble our efforts to ensure safety,
security, political progress and peace for the people of
Darfur and for the Sudan as a whole. They have
suffered enough. They deserve our continuing interest,
our help and our support. We believe that the three
resolutions that the Council has adopted in the last
week constitute a substantial contribution to that end.
