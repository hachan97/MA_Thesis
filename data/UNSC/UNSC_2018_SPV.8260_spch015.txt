Mr. Mounzer (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): We have said time and again that we are
working with the Special Envoy of the Secretary-
General for Syria. A delegation from the Syrian Arab
Republic is working directly with him. We are eager, as
we have said repeatedly, to find a peaceful, Syrian-led
solution to the Syrian crisis.
