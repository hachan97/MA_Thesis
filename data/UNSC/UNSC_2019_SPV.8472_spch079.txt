Mr. Arreaza (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): I apologize once again, but the only
thing we would ask the delegation of the United States
is that it honour its obligations, as clearly laid out in
the Charter of the United Nations. We do not need a
resolution or a statement. I simply wish to hear him say

that the United States, like any other Member of the
Organization, rejects the use of force against the people
of the Bolivarian Republic ofVenezuela,

The meeting rose at 8pm.
