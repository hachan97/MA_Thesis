The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received a letter dated 27 August 1999 from the
Permanent Representative of Burkina Faso to the United
Nations, which reads as follows:

"I have the honour, in my capacity as
Chairman of the Islamic Group at the United
Nations, to request that the Security Council extend
an invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to His Excellency Mr. Mokhtar Lamani,
Permanent Observer of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference to the United Nations, during the
Council's discussion of the item, 'The situation in
Afghanistan'".

That letter will be published as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/1999/916.

If I hear no objection, I shall take it that the Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 to
His Excellency Mr. Lamani.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
