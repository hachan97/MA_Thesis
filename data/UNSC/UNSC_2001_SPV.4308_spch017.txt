The President: Following Ambassador Wang, I
will turn back to Mr. Annabi, whom I encourage to
give quite brief answers to some of the points that have
come up, because some of the more substantive
questions will need to be dealt with with full
consideration by the Secretariat in the Secretary-
General's report.
