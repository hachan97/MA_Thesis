The President: I thank the representative of Liberia
for his kind words addressed to my predecessor and to
me. I take it he was not aware of the new practice of the
Council to encourage speakers to forgo the expression of
compliments to the President and his predecessor.

The next speaker is the representative of Nigeria. I
invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make
his statement.
