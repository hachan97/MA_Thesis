The President: I shall now make a further statement
in my capacity of Foreign Minister of New Zealand.

I thank the representative of Afghanistan for
his frank remark in response to my statement. New
Zealand has indeed been a true friend of Afghanistan
over 10 years of effort and lives lost in a very difficult
period. The issue of the stability of the Government
of Afghanistan is fundamental to the success of the
international effort, and we look forward to working
with Afghanistan to make things as strong as possible
both for the international community and for the
Government of Afghanistan.

I resume my functions as President of the Security
Council.

I now give the floor to the representative of Italy.
