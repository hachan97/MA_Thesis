Mr. Yao Shaojun (China) (spoke in Chinese): China listened attentively to the briefing delivered by His Excellency Mr. Edi Rama, Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in European (OSCE) and Prime Minister and Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Albania. At present, the international situation is undergoing more rapidand profound changes, with increasing factors causing instability and uncertainty. Unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise, which jeopardize international order and the rule of law. As Mr. Rama mentioned, multilateralism is under attack. No country is immune to the risks and challenges involved. While the United Nations is at the centre of the international collective security mechanism, regional and subregional organizations have unique advantages in resolving regional hotspot issues. China supports the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations in advancing their cooperation, in line with Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations, with a view to jointly maintaining international peace and security, firmly upholding the purposes and principles of the Charter, vigorously advancing dialogue and consultation to resolve regional hotspot issues and actively conducting preventive diplomacy to diffuse disputes and conflicts peacefully. The regional and subregional organizations should safeguard multilateralism. Their actions should comply with international law and basic norms governing international relations, in particular respect for national sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.
