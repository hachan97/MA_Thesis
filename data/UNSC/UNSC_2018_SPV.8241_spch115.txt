Mr. Ibragimov (Uzbekistan): Mr. President, I wish
to thank you for having convened this open debate on
maintaining international peace and security through
promoting and protecting youth rights, which has
become one of the key issues on the United Nations
agenda. I wish to take this opportunity to inform the
Council about the latest developments in Uzbekistan in
this area.

For the past year and a half in Uzbekistan, under
the leadership of President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, very
dynamic processes of societal transformation including
the promotion of youth rights, have been observed. The
Government has been taking bold steps towards further
expanding reforms in all fields, with the aim ofbuilding
a democratic State and ajust society guided by a simple
principle: that human interests come first.

Today the world's youth population has already
reached almost 2 billion people, and the planet's
future and well-being depend on what kind of people
our children will grow up to be. The Government of
Uzbekistan therefore attaches great importance to
youth-related issues. We in Uzbekistan have enacted
a national law on the youth policy of the State, which
defines the legal framework and guidelines for the
formation and implementation of our youth policy, with
a view to strengthening the role of the public, especially
non-governmental organizations, local authorities
and the media, in implementing that policy. We also
overhauled the youth movement by creating the Union
of Youth of Uzbekistan, which is now more actively
involved in the socio-political life of the country.

An effective youth policy is particularly important
nowadays, at a time when terrorist threats and the
radicalization of young people are widespread across
the globe. As research shows, most crimes linked
with extremist activity and violence are committed by
people under the age of 30.

In this regard, today it is extremely important
to fight for the hearts and minds of young people by
providing them with the conditions necessary for self-
realization and creating a barrier against the spread of
the virus of the ideology of violence. For that reason,
we in Uzbekistan believe that it is crucial to advance
multilateral cooperation in the sphere of social support
for youth by protecting their rights and interests.

This June, Uzbekistan, in collaboration with the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
will host an international conference on the role of
youth in preventing and countering violent extremism
and radicalization that lead to terrorism, which will
address the following key issues: understanding
the nature of violent extremism and radicalization
leading to terrorism; exchanging opinions on effective
strategies to prevent youth from falling prey to radical
ideologies; identifying needs and opportunities in terms
of implementing specific actions by States and civil
society for preventing the spread of radical ideology
among youth, while ensuring respect for human rights;
and sharing positive experiences and lessons learned by
Central Asian States on engaging youth in confronting
violent extremism and radicalization. I am very pleased
to note that the Secretary-General's Envoy on Youth,
Ms. Wickramanayake, has been invited to that event,
and we look forward to her participation.

During the seventy-second session of the
General Assembly last September, the President of
Uzbekistan proposed the development of a United
Nations convention on the rights of youth, a unified
international legal instrument aimed at developing and
implementing a youth policy in a context ofglobalization
and of the rapid development of information and
communication technologies.

Given the importance ofthis issue, we in Uzbekistan
hope that this initiative will receive the overwhelming
support of all States Members of the United Nations,
and we will jointly develop a draft of such a convention
and make coherent efforts to bring it to fruition.
