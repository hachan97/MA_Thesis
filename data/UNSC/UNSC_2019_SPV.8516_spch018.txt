Mr. Ipo (Cote d'Ivoire) (spoke in French): My
delegation commends Ms. DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-
General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, for her
informative briefing on the current situation in eastern
Ukraine. We also thank Assistant Secretary-General
Mueller and Ambassadors Apakan and Sajdik for their
enlightening briefings.

My delegation notes with regret that differences
in interpretation are jeopardizing the implementation
of the Minsk agreements, in the Normandy format,
signed on 12 February 2015. The situation on the
ground remains marked by ongoing violations of
the ceasefire and restrictions on the movement of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine. In
addition, the continuing climate of mistrust between
the Ukrainian parties is clearly a major obstacle that
could undermine the international community's
efforts to restore peace to the Donbas region.
Cote d'Ivoire calls on all parties to exercise restraint
and urges them to fully implement the Minsk
agreements in order to save many human lives and
prevent the destruction of civilian infrastructure
essential to the provision of basic social services to
those in need. In that regard, my country reiterates
its support for the efforts of the OSCE Special
Monitoring Mission and calls on it to fully participate
in efforts to restore peace and stability in the region.
Cote d'Ivoire reaffirms its support for all actions and
efforts to find a negotiated political solution to the crisis
in Ukraine. To that end, it urges all stakeholders to
strictly respect their commitments in order to maintain
the current ceasefire, in accordance with resolution
2202 (2015).

Finally, my delegation welcomes the successful
election of His Excellency Mr. Volodymyr Zelensky
as President of Ukraine and hopes that it helps to
give new momentum to the peace process and to
regional cooperation.
