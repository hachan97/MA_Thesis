Mr. Guehenno: I will make just two brief
observations at this late hour.

First, I would like to say that I do, indeed, agree
with the comments by several members of the Council
with regard to the approach taken by Mr. Steiner on
benchmarks. If I may, I will not only share those
comments with Mr. Steiner, but also inform other
missions of that approach, because I believe - as
many members of the Council have said - that
providing greater transparency and, therefore, more
accountability will help to ensure a better relationship
between the Council and the Mission, as well as
helping other missions, especially those that have a
wide-ranging mandate, to be more focused and
therefore more effective.

My second observation relates to what the
Ambassador of Yugoslavia said. He reminded us that if
much has been achieved, a lot remains to be done. In
that respect, I would like to say that if we want to be
successful in one of the goals of the Mission - such as
the issue of returns and reintegration - we will have to
continue to address a wide range of issues, from
security to a growing and vibrant economy, as well as
areas such as housing and property directorates, as
mentioned by the Ambassador of Norway. We will
have to tackle a very large number of issues, and that
will require not only the political support of this
Council, but also the financial support and attention of
the international community. I am encouraged by the
support that the mission finds in the Council.
