Mr. Ferrarin (Italy): Italy is one of the sponsors of
the resolution just adopted by the Security Council
welcoming the Basic Agreement recently signed in Croatia
between the Croatian Government and the local Serb
representatives.

This Agreement comes at a moment of serious tension
in and around Eastern Slavonia. The political solution
achieved, particularly the agreement on the establishment of
a transitional administration and of an international force
should guarantee a gradual and peaceful reintegration of the
territory into the Republic of Croatia with full respect for
the rights of the local Serbian population.

It is important that in Eastern Slavonia there should
not be a repetition of the events that took place in Krajina
last August, in other words, the chaotic exodus of the Serb
population from lands where they had resided for centuries.

On the other hand, it is equally important that the
Croatian population residing in Vukovar and in the rest of
that area be allowed to return peacefully and safely to their
places of origin. In Italy the general public has not
forgotten the tragic images of the artillery attacks on
Vukovar, a martyred city that has sadly become one of the
symbols of the civilian population's suffering in the
conflicts of the former Yugoslavia.

Thanks to the agreement reached, Eastern Slavonia can
become an example of peaceful coexistence among the
diverse ethnic and cultural groups in the former Yugoslavia.
