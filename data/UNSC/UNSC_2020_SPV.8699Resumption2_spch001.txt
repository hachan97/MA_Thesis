The President: In accordance with rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite the representatives of Colombia, Qatar and Senegal to participate in this meeting. I wish to remind all speakers to limit their statements to no more than four minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with longer statements are kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber. I now give the floor to the representative of Morocco.
