Mr. Djani (Indonesia): Indonesia welcomes the adoption of resolution 2507 (2020) and thanks the penholder for its efforts in trying to find consensus and bridge differences. We heard the call from the Central African Republic and recognize its efforts to fulfil its obligations under the benchmarks. Today's adoption is a form of support to the Government of the Central African Republic in the need to combat armed groups and maintain stability closer to the upcoming national election. Today's adoption also emphasized our views on sanctions. First, sanctions are not an end in themselves but a means to achieve our collective goals. Secondly, sanctions are not forever and should be used in line with the real situation on the ground. Indonesia reiterates its support for the efforts made by the Government of the Central African Republic and further calls on the wider membership of the UnitedNations to continue its support to the country. Indonesia will continue to push for unity in the Council and the bridging of differences among members in order to move forward in our collective goal to save lives.
