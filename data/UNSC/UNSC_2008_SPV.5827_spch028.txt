Mr. Gillerman (Israel): Many members of the
Council here today have expressed through this debate
their concern over the futility of these meetings, and
they may now justifiably feel they were right. I wish to
express my own sentiment that I did feel such futility
through much of the meeting's duration. However, I
feel that the meeting did ultimately serve an important
purpose. It illustrated vividly and graphically how
important it is to ensure that the membership of the
Security Council is carefully screened and considered,
and how much responsibility it carries with it. As
specified by Article 23 of the Charter of the United
Nations,

"The General Assembly shall elect ten other
Members of the United Nations to be
non-permanent members of the Security Council,
due regard being specially paid, in the first
instance to the contribution of Members of the
United Nations to the maintenance of
international peace and security ...".

The importance of this paragraph was highlighted
today by the litany of bias, distortion, bigotry and hate
delivered by a representative of a country that was
itself under sanctions by this Council not long ago. The
same people who gave the world Lockerbie are trying
to lecture this Council on human rights. The fact that
he was congratulated by the assassins of Damascus,
who are themselves under investigation by this
Council, only added a sense of the surreal to it.

That this was done by the President of this
Council while expressing his total support for terrorism
should alarm us all as to what awaits us and what
awaits this Council in the next 23 months. Maybe
today all I can say is "TGIF" - "Thank God, it's
February" - soon.
