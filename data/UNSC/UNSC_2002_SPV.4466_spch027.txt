Mr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I apologize for just arriving, but I had a
counter-terrorism subcommittee meeting, where we
were reviewing the first series of reports. I did not want
my absence to be taken to mean that I was not satisfied
with the work of the Security Council this month.

I very briefly would like to express my gratitude
to you, Mr. President, your delegation and your
Minister. You had a very complicated month, and you
steered our ship in a dignified way. We adopted all the
decisions that we were supposed to adopt, and I
sincerely congratulate you on that.

I have just noticed that the Secretariat has also
given us a gift, an elegant carafe of water, so this
Chamber is becoming better and better. I hope that this
will improve our mood next month.
