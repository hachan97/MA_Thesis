The President: A number of speakers remain on
my list. Eleven Council members have yet to speak,
after which I hope that we will be able to have the
benefit of the responses of our other participants.

I will suspend the meeting now, and we will
resume promptly at 3 pm.

The meeting was suspended at 1.20 p.m.
