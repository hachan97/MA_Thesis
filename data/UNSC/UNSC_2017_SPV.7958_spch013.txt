Mr. Aboulatta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At
the outset, allow me to express our full appreciation
to the delegations of the United States and China for
preparing and presenting resolution 2356 (2017), which
was just adopted by the Security Council (resolution 2356 (2017)).
The unanimous adoption of resolution 2356 (2017)
sends a clear message by all members of the Council
and the international community that they oppose
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's recent
violations of its commitments in accordance with
the relevant Security Council resolutions, especially
resolutions 2321 (2016) and 2270 (2016). Egypt calls
upon all parties to make further diplomatic efforts to
create a political path towards the denuclearization of
the Korean peninsula and to safeguard the international
non-proliferation regime. Egypt stands ready to
support any international effort and any initiative to
peacefully settle the chronic Korean crisis. We reaffirm
the importance of avoiding the deterioration of the
humanitarian situation in the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea.

In conclusion, we reaffirm the pivotal role of the
Security Council and the need to speak with one voice.
The international community must continue its positive
interaction and collaboration with the Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1718 (2006) and its
Panel of Experts in order to implement all the relevant
Security Council resolutions.
