Ms. Wronecka (Poland): Poland welcomes the
Council's adoption of resolution 2444 (2018), renewing
the measures on Somalia for one year and lifting the
sanctions regime on Eritrea. We would like to thank
the United Kingdom for its constructive and efficient
conduct of the negotiations on the document.

We acknowledge the importance of the sanctions
regime in the case of Somalia, where the Federal
Government is in the process of taking over full
responsibility for the country's security and where
Al-Shabaab continues to pose a serious threat to
stability. We hope that the renewed measures will help
to limit Al-Shabaab's access to arms and financing and
strengthen the Government's State-building efforts.

To reiterate what we have stated on numerous
occasions in recent months: Poland welcomes the
developments in the Horn of Africa, especially the
rapprochement between Ethiopia and Eritrea and
the positive dynamic between Eritrea and Djibouti.
We believe that sanctions are not a punishment but a
policy tool, and that they should be subject to regular
review and adjusted to the realities on the ground. In
line with that approach, we have supported the lifting
of the sanctions regime on Eritrea. We hope that
recent encouraging events will enable durable peace to
be achieved across the region. At the same time, we
believe that the Security Council should closely follow
the normalization between Eritrea and Djibouti and
stand ready to support the two countries' efforts to
peacefully resolve their differences.
