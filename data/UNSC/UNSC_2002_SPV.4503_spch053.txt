Mr. Gopinathan (India): Mr. President, we thank
you for convening this emergency meeting of the
Council. We also thank the Secretary-General for his
statement to the Council today on the sharp
deterioration ofthe situation in the Middle East.

We are meeting this evening in extraordinary
circumstances. The Council expressed the collective
will of the international community only a fortnight
ago in resolution 1397 (2002), which outlined the
vision of two States living in peace within secure
borders. Only yesterday, the Summit of the Arab
League States in Beirut adopted the resolution
supporting the peace plan put forward by the Crown
Prince of Saudi Arabia. All of us thought that the push
towards peace in the Middle East had acquired
significant momentum through this action of the Arab
League. Today, we seem to have moved far away from
that vision. The needless escalation of violence in the
region is unwarranted and is a cause of deepest
concern.

We call for an end to the violence and for the
resumption of peaceful dialogue and negotiations in
order to realize the vision of two States living in peace
within secure boundaries in accordance with
resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and subsequent
accords agreed to and accepted by the parties.

President Arafat continues to remain for all of us
the embodiment of Palestinian nationhood. The way
President Arafat is being treated is shocking. We do not
see how the siege of President Arafat and today's
military operations aimed at his headquarters can in
any way contribute to the eventual cessation of
violence or greater security.

My delegation reiterates our call for an end to the
violence and the immediate resumption of dialogue and
negotiations so as to achieve lasting peace and security
for all in the region. We call upon the Council to
express the collective will of the international
community, once again in less than three weeks, for
immediate resumption of such a dialogue.
