The President (spoke in Spanish): Before giving
the floor to the Ambassador of Zimbabwe, I would like
to recall what was said this morning about confining
the length of statements to five minutes for the sake of
the efficiency of the Council's work. We will be
circulating the full text of statements provided by
delegates.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Zimbabwe.
