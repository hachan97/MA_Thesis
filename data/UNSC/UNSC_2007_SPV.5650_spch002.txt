Mr. Jenie (Indonesia): It is a great pleasure for
Indonesia, as Chair of the Security Council Committee
established pursuant to resolution 918 (1994),
concerning Rwanda, to welcome the adoption of
resolution 1749 (2007). The adoption of that resolution
is a follow-up to the Committee's recommendation on
the need to terminate the measures imposed by
paragraph 11 of resolution 1011 (1995), which required
that States that export arms or related materiel destined
for use by the Government of Rwanda notify the
Committee of such shipments. It also reflects the
acknowledgement of the Council of the positive
developments in Rwanda and the Great Lakes region.

I would like to take this opportunity to express
my appreciation to the members of the Council and
their experts for their constructive contributions. I also
wish to thank the Secretariat and the Committee's
Secretary for their invaluable support.
