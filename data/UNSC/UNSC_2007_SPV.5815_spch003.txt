The President: I thank Ambassador Pascoe for
his briefing.

Expression of thanks to outgoing members of
the Council

The President: As this may be the last meeting
of the Security Council for December 2007, I would
like, on behalf of the Council, to express the most
sincere appreciation of the Council to the five outgoing
members - the Congo, Ghana, Peru, Qatar and
Slovakia. I know I speak on behalf of the Council
when I commend those five members for their hard
work and contributions during their 2006-2007 term on
the Security Council.

I think that when members of a family leave the
family, it is mainly a moment of sadness - a moment
in which we acknowledge what the members have
given to the family. As in any family, there are
moments of discussion - "frank discussion", as we
say in our language - but it is precisely through the
possibility of having frank discussions and exchanges
of view that we enrich ourselves and achieve results. It
is through the efforts and points of View of everybody
that we reach our goals. I feel that, along with the
sadness, there is also a sense of the special bond that
we have built among us all in this period. We will
remember. I urge all my colleagues to take care.

In accordance with the understanding reached in
the Council's prior consultations, I now invite Council
members to informal consultations to continue our
discussion on the subject.

The meeting rose at 10.45 am.
