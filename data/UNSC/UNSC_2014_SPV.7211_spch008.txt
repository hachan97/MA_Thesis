Mr. Barros Melet (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): First
of all, we would like to thank Ambassador Quinlan
for presenting the quarterly report of the work of the
Committee established pursuant to resolution 1737
(2006). We appreciate the work that he has done as the
Chair of the Committee.

Between 2 and 4 April, the Panel of Experts of
the 1737 Committee visited the cities of Valparaiso
and Santiago in Chile, where it was able to directly
observe how my country applies and complies with
the 1737 regime and other United Nations sanctions
regimes. During the visit of the Panel of Experts, on
more than one occasion we received queries on the
status of multilateral sanctions system. As the Final
Report of the Panel of Experts published on 11 June
sets forth (8/2014/394, annex), the consultations took
place through various interviews and meetings. The
report makes clear that high expectations - as well as
a confusion of ideas - on a possible broad agreement
among the P5+1 and Iran on the nuclear programme of
that country were generated both in the private sector
and among the public.

That is a new context for the work of the Committee
that we think should be addressed. We hope that the
members of the Committee will make a serious attempt
to reach consensus and move forward, at least with
respect to the first recommendation in the Final Report
of the Panel of Experts referring to guidance on the
status of Security Council sanctions against Iran.

Chile supports the diplomatic efforts to promote
dialogue and the peaceful resolution of disputes. As we
have said on other occasions, our country is following
with great interest the ongoing negotiations, even if
we do so with some caution. Our attitude stems from
such cases as that of the vessel Klos C, currently under
consideration by the Committee, which, according to
information collected, would seem to be a violation of
paragraph 5 of resolution 1747 (2007).
