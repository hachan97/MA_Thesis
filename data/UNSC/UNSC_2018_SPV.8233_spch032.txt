Mr. Ma Zhaoxu (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
has always opposed the use of force in the context of
international relations. We advocate for respecting the
sovereignty, independence, unity, and the territorial
integrity of all countries. Any unilateral military action
bypassing the Security Council runs counter to the
purposes and principles of the Charter of the United
Nations, violates the principles of international law
and the basic norms governing international relations
and, in the present case, will further complicate the
Syrian issue.

Based on that principled position, China voted in
favour of draft resolution S/2018/355, proposed by the
Russian Federation. I would like to emphasize here
that a political settlement is the only viable pathway
to solving the Syrian issue. China urges the parties
involved to remain calm, exercise restraint, return
to the framework of international law and resolve
issues through dialogue and negotiations We support
the role of the United Nations as the main channel
for mediation, and we will spare no effort to reach a
political settlement of the situation in Syria together
with the international community.
