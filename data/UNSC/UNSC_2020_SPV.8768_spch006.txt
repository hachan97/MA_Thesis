Mrs. Craft (United States of America): The United States will continue to stand by Haiti and support the vital work of the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti. Resolution 2547 (2020) ensures that the United Nations has the mandate that it needs to continue its critical efforts to support democratic institutions, strengthen the rule of law, promote stability and protect human rights in Haiti, in partnership with the United States, Haiti's neighbours, the core group and the international community. The mandate also reiterates the urgent need for national dialogue to address long-standing drivers of instability and to conduct long-overdue legislative elections as soon as feasible. A well-functioning democracy requires all branches of Government, including the legislative branch, to play their roles. We welcome the renewal of the mandate, and we will continue to demand progress from Haiti's political actors in resolving those long-standing challenges.
