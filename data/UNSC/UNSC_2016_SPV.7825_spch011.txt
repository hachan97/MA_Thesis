Mr. Rosselli (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): I will
be very brief. My delegation voted in favour of a draft
resolution (S/2016/1026) that we thought was highly
inadequate. Uruguay understands that the solution to the
crisis in Syria requires an immediate and unconditional
ceasefire throughout the country. The draft resolution
was very far from what we would have liked to have
seen. Nevertheless, we could not vote against it because
at least it could achieve a pause in the massacre. As for
abstaining, there is no option between saving lives and
continuing with the massacre. Therefore, we voted with
full conviction for a draft resolution that I must say it
is inadequate.

I have no doubt that currently in Syria very few
people are worried about what time the text was put in
blue and, for that matter, most certainly they will not
understand how we could be worried about something
to that effect. But in any case, what is very serious is
that the Security Council continues to be unable to
fulfil its role. We can ask ourselves what was the use
of this meeting. Somehow, it might remind us of the
Gabriel Garcia Marquez novel Chronicle of a Death
Foretold, in which everyone knew that Santiago Nasar
would be killed that day by the Vicario brothers but no
one did anything to prevent it.

I believe that the difference here is that many
have been working in search of consensus, although
that continues to escape us. But I think that we
must be persistent in our efforts to ensure that the
solution to the crisis in Syria be a political one and
not military - a solution that includes Syrians and is
led by them. Certainly, it must be a solution in which
the numerous terrorist groups that are constantly
obstructing the pursuit of a solution are excluded from
the political landscape.
