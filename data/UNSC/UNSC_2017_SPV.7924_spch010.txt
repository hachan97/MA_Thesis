Mr. Umarov (Kazakhstan): We thank the United
States delegation, as the penholder, as well as other
stakeholders for their efforts with regard to resolution
2350 (2017), which we support.

Kazakhstan fully recognizes the importance of the
activities of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in
Haiti to restore and secure a stable environment in Haiti.
In the light of the new tasks that have been delegated, we
support the transition to a new and integrated Mission
focusing on the rule oflaw, criminal justice, and human
rights reforms in the security and other sectors. My
delegation welcome the progress made in strengthening
stability and democracy, and in restoring constitutional
order in the country following the peaceful and orderly
elections - which is recognized as a commendable
achievement for a country still in transition after facing
many setbacks.

The strong engagement of the international
community is an obvious necessity for Haiti's
sustainable development, with its measures to improve
housing, water, education, health care and promote
gender equality. Haiti also needs all our support in
combating transnational crime. However, this is the
beginning of a new era for Haiti. The situation on
the ground is still fragile and the Security Council
should continue to follow developments in and around
the country.

At this stage, the focus of the United Nations
Stabilization Mission in Haiti, the United Nations
and others is on reforming and strengthening State
institutions to lay the foundation of stability, first,
by implementing the transition plan and building the
operational and institutional capacity of the Haitian
National Police. Simultaneously, the new mandate,
by ensuring law and order, will indirectly support
peacebuilding and promote socioeconomic development
geared towards a framework of mutual accountability
among the Government of Haiti, the United Nations
and the international community.
