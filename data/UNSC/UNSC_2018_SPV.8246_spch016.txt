The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now
make a statement in my capacity as the representative
of Peru.

Peru deems it necessary to renew the mandate of the
United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara in order to support the political process, with a
view to achieving a solution to the question of the status
of Western Sahara and to meeting the humanitarian
needs of the Sahrawi people.

We believe it urgent to relaunch the political
process, under the auspices of the United Nations
and the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General,
without preconditions and in good faith, with a view to
facilitating agreement on a just, lasting and mutually
acceptable political solution based on international law
and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and
that would lead to the self-determination of the people
of Western Sahara.

Finally, we would express our concern at the
difficulties facing the Sahrawi refugees and their
dependence on external humanitarian assistance, as
well as our expectation that progress in the negotiations
will improve the human rights situation and living
conditions of the people of Western Sahara in all of
its aspects.

I new resume my functions as President of
the Council.

There are no more speakers inscribed on my list.

The meeting rose at 3.50 pm.
