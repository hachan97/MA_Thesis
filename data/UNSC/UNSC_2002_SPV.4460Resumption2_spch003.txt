The President: Before giving the floor to the
next speaker, may I reiterate my appeal of yesterday for
speakers to limit the duration of their statements as
much as possible. At 5.30 pm. we will be holding
consultations on the Middle East, and I hope to
complete the list of speakers before then.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Jamaica. I invite her to take a seat at
the Council table and to make her statement.
