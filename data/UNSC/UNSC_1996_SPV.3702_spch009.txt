The President (interpretation from Spanish): I should
like to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Cuba and Mali, in which they request
to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice,
I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite these
representatives to participate in the discussion, without the
right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules
of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Nunez-
Mosquera (Cuba) and Mr. Ouane (Mali) took the
seats reserved form them at the side of the Council
chamber.
