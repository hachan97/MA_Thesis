Mr. Zhao Yong (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
supports the extension of the mandate of the United
Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara and hopes that the Mission will continue to
play a constructive role in stabilizing the situation in
Western Sahara and assisting in the implementation of
confidence-building measures.

China's position on the issue of Western Sahara
has been consistent and remains unchanged. Based
on that, we voted in favour of resolution 2218 (2015),
adopted by the Security Council this morning. We
know that some Council members have concerns about
the resolution. When the members of the Council were
holding consultations on the draft resolution, more time
should have been allowed for that, and more patience
should have been shown so as to enable us to listen more
extensively to the various opinions. Allowing more
adequate time for consultations would have enabled us
to seek the greatest possible consensus and obtain the
widest possible support.
