The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security

Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.

After consultations among Council members, I

have been authorized to make the following statement
on their behalf:

"The Security Council expresses its deep
concern about the recent upsurge of violence and
instability in the Central African Republic, which
aimed at destabilizing the country andjeopardizing
the transition process. The Security Council
strongly condemns such violence, including all
attacks against civilians, intercommunal violence,
targeted violence against women and children,
lootings of humanitarian premises and attacks
against United Nations peacekeepers.

"The Security Council emphasizes that some
of these attacks may constitute war crimes and
that those responsible for all abuses and violations
of human rights and violations of international
humanitarian law must be held accountable.

"The Security Council also emphasizes that
those undermining the peace, stability or security
of the Central African Republic, threatening or
impeding the political transition process, targeting
civilians and attacking peacekeepers may meet
criteria for designation under sanctions as stated in
resolution 2196 (2015).

"The Security Council reiterates its strong
condemnation of all violations of applicable
international law and demands that all parties
concerned strictly comply with their obligations
under international humanitarian law and
international human rights law, as applicable, as
well as implement relevant decisions of the Security
Council.

"The Security Council reiterates its support
for the Transitional Authority, under the leadership
of Catherine Samba-Panza as the Transitional
Head of State, and calls on all stakeholders in the
Central African Republic to commit to peace and

reconciliation through the implementation of the
agreements adopted at the Bangui Forum in May
2015.

"The Security Council reiterates its decision
to apply the asset freeze and travel ban measures
contained in paragraphs 4 and 7 of resolution 2196
(2015), to individuals and entities engaging in
or providing support for acts that undermine the
peace, stability or security of the Central African
Republic, consistent with paragraph 11 and 12 of
resolution 2196 (2015). The Security Council also
reiterates its intention to further expand the list of
individuals and entities maintained by the Sanctions
Committee established pursuant to resolution 2127
(2013) by adding those responsible for the recent
outbreak of violence, particularly those who have
provided support to, acted for or on behalf of, or at
the direction of an individual or an entity already
sanctioned by the Committee.

"The Security Council reiterates that those
responsible for the recent violence, both perpetrators
and those who otherwise participate, should be held
accountable and reiterates that some of those recent
acts of Violence may amount to crimes under the
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
(ICC), to which the Central African Republic is
State party. The Security Council welcomes in this
regard the statement of the Prosecutor of the ICC
of 30 September 2015 regarding the recent upsurge
of violence in the Central African Republic,
and in which the Prosecutor noted that a year
ago, following a referral by the Central African
Republic authorities, the Prosecutor opened an
investigation into crimes committed in the country
since 1 August 2012.

"The Security Council calls on the Transitional
Authorities to launch, with the technical assistance
of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated
Stabilization Mission in the Central African
Republic (MINUSCA), investigations to identify
those responsible and bring them to justice.

"The Security Council underlines the possible
role that the domestic Special Criminal Court might
play in this regard, stresses the urgency in the Court
taking up its initial functions, and emphasizes the
need for MINUSCA to provide technical assistance
and capacity building for the Central African
Republic Authorities in line with paragraph 32 (g)
of its mandate pursuant to resolution 2217 (2015).
"The Security Council expresses concern
about the recurring incidents of prisoners escaping
from custody in the Central African Republic,
which negatively impacts the fight against
impunity and the efforts to stabilize the country,
and calls upon the Transitional Authorities to
bolster their efforts to investigate, prosecute and
detain prisoners in a safe, secure and humane
manner, with MINUSCA's support as appropriate,
in accordance with its mandate. It also expresses its
concerns about the reported participation of some
elements of the Forces armees centrafricaines in
the recent incidents in Bangui, underlining the
need for training and the importance of progress in
reforming the security sector, including on vetting
and on accountability processes in the defence
and security forces, to be accomplished before the
Forces armees centrafricaines can be returned to
operational duties.

"The Security Council demands that all those
who seek to weaken the transitional Government
from within and outside the Central African
Republic, including militias and non-State armed
groups, cease all forms ofviolence and destabilizing
activities immediately, lay down their arms, and
fully implement the agreement for cessation of
hostilities and violence, signed on 23 July 2014
in Brazzaville, Congo, as well as the agreement
on principles of disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration and security sector reform adopted at
the Bangui Forum of May 2015.

"The Security Council takes note of the
significant progress achieved in the voters
registration process in the Central African
Republic, with an unprecedented number of citizens
registered to date, calls for this process to be
completed swiftly, and emphasizes the importance
of the registration of all Central African Republic
populations, including refugees in neighbouring
States.

"The Security Council reiterates the
critical importance and urgency of holding the
constitutional referendum and first rounds of
presidential and legislative elections by the end
of 2015 in a free, fair, transparent manner, which
is inclusive of all the components of the Central
African Republic society, and in accordance
with the Transitional Constitutional Charter. In
this regard, the Security Council underlines that

the provisions of the Transitional Constitutional
Charter should be strictly and fully implemented,
and calls on the Transitional Authorities, including
the National Electoral Authority and the National
Transitional Council, to adopt and publish, without
any further delay, a revised calendar for the holding
of elections as soon as possible. The Security
Council also calls upon the National Electoral
Authority to continue the preparations for the
referendum and the elections, without delay.

"The Security Council underscores the
importance of making all appropriate efforts to
ensure peace and reconciliation in the Central
African Republic, in this regard commends the
joint action of religious leaders in the Central
African Republic in pursuing intercommunal
peace, and calls upon the Central African Republic
authorities to take all necessary steps to create
conditions for lasting reconciliation, including by
protecting civilians from any religious or ethnic-
based violence.

"The Security Council emphasizes that
the continued role of the region, including the
international mediator, the Chair of the Economic
Community of Central African States and the
countries of the subregion, as well as the African
Union and the United Nations as participants in the
mediation, is critical for the promotion of lasting
peace and stability in the Central African Republic.
The Security Council encourages countries in the
region to further use their leverage and regional
meetings to encourage progress on the transition
and towards the elections and to prevent spoilers,
within the Central African Republic and outside,
from attempting to disrupt these processes.

"The Security Council calls upon troop- and
police-contributing countries to MINUSCA to
expedite the upgrading of their capabilities, and
urges other Member States to provide the necessary
support to enable them to reach United Nations
standards without any further delay.

"The Security Council further calls upon the
international community to continue to support the
Central African Republic by addressing critical
priorities articulated by Central Africans during the
Bangui Forum for the next 12 to 18 months, which
include disarmament, demobilization, reintegration
and repatriation, security sector reform, justice and
reconciliation, including the establishment of the

domestic Special Criminal Court, strengthening
the capacity of local courts and the establishment
of the commission on truth, justice, reparation
and reconciliation, the restoration and extension
of State authority in support of democratic and
economic governance, and economic and social
development. The Security Council welcomes the
high-level event held on the margins of the General
Assembly, and encourages Member States that have
pledged support for these programmes to disburse
funds quickly and to garner additional support in
priority areas that remain underfunded.

"The Security Council reiterates its support for
MINUSCA to assist, as mandated by the Security
Council in resolution 2217 (2015), the Transitional
Authority and the people of the Central African
Republic in their efforts to bring lasting peace
and stability to their country, protect civilians,
including those targeted on ethnic or religious
grounds, and restore State authority over the entire
territory.

"The Security Council expresses concern over
reports that two sanctioned individuals are travelling
in the region, and underlines its observation that
individuals who knowingly facilitate the travel of a
listed individual in violation of the travel ban may
be determined by the Committee to have met the
designation criteria for sanctions."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2015/ 17.

The meeting rose at 9.50 am.
