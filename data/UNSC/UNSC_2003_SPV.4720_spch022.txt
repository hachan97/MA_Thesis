The President (spoke in French): I thank the
representative of the United Kingdom for his
comments.

Before continuing, I would like to call on the
Director of the Programme for Coordination and
Assistance for Security and Development (PCASED)
and the Executive Secretary of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Some
questions and observations were raised. Perhaps they
would be kind enough to answer them: specific
measures on disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration, concerns expressed by the representative
of Spain regarding child soldiers and activities for
reintegration of these child soldiers, as well as the
difficulties encountered to implement the Moratorium,
and other comments and observations.

I call on the Executive Secretary of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
