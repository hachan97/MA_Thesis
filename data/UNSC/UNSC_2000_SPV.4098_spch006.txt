Mr. Ouane (Mali) (spoke in French): I thank
Ambassador Greenstock and his delegation, as well as the

 

experts who were involved, for their hard and excellent
work, which made possible the formulation of a very
realistic draft resolution on the situation in Sierra Leone.
My thanks go also to Mr. Hedi Annabi, who has, as usual,
given us a very comprehensive and clear briefing following
the submission of the report of the Secretary-General.

I wish to reiterate the very strong commitment of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
and in particular of its current Chairman, President Alpha
Oumar Konare, to speedily bringing peace to Sierra Leone.
I wish also to stress the importance of the support of the
Security Council and of the international community, which
in our view is essential if we are successfully to implement
the Lome Peace Agreement.

I shall not address Mr. Annabi's comments at this
stage, but will just ardently express our hope that the draft
resolution on which the Council will take action later will
be speedily implemented. My delegation supports that draft
resolution.
