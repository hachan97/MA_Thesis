The President (spoke in Chinese): The Security
Council will now proceed to the consideration of its
annual report to the General Assembly, for the period
from 1 August 2007 to 31 July 2008.

Members of the Council have before them the
draft report. The introduction to the draft report was
prepared by the delegation of Viet Nam, as President of
the Council in July 2008, with the participation of
other members of the Council and the immediate past
members of the Council. The body of the report was
prepared by the Secretariat. I should like to express
appreciation to Viet Nam and the Secretariat for their
respective contributions.

I should like to point out that the format of the
draft report now before the Council corresponds to the
relevant provisions contained in the notes by the
President of 19 July 2006 (5/2006/507) and
19 December 2007 (S/2007/749).

I now give the floor to the representative of Viet
Nam in his capacity as head of the delegation
responsible for drafting the introduction to this year's
annual report.
