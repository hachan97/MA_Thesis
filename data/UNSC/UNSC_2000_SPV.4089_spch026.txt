Mr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Not that serious.
Like other colleagues who have spoken before me,
I welcome Mrs. Ogata. I would like to thank her very
much for her briefing, which was a very comprehensive
confirmation of the existence of serious problems on the
matter of Africa's refugees and internally displaced
persons. We have heard yet another analysis of those
problems, as well as her appeal to the Security Council to
make its contribution to resolving those problems. I fully
agree with her appeal. I also agree with what has been
said by many of my colleagues, namely, that the time has
now come to move on to real action. We believe that,
within its competence, the Security Council can and must
make its contribution to resolving those problems.

I would very briefly like to say that we do agree
with the need for comprehensive support for the African
initiative being taken by the Organization of African
Unity and at the level of subregional organizations not
only to deal with the specific problems of refugees and
internally displaced persons, but also with efforts to
resolve conflicts. As many colleagues have said, that is
the underlying cause of the existence of refugees and
internally displaced persons.

 

The Security Council, of course, has a special
responsibility in the settlement of conflicts, and we will be
ready to do our utmost to support the efforts of the African
countries themselves through concrete action. In this regard,
we will be guided by this willingness during consideration
in the Council of specific conflict situations in Africa.
