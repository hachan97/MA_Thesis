Mr. Orrenius Skau (Sweden): We are appalled
by the regrettable loss of life and the large number of
wounded today, including children, who all seem to
be Palestinian. There must now be an immediate and
proper investigation by the authorities. It appears that
the Israeli security forces have used live ammunition,
which has exacerbated the gravity of the situation. The
use of force must always be proportional and lethal
force should be used only as a last resort. Israel must
uphold its responsibilities under international human
rights law and respect the right to peaceful protest. We
also note with concern the air strikes carried out by
Israel in Gaza.

The situation should notbe a surprise to the Council.
Special Coordinator Mladenov warned us only a few
days ago about the risks of escalating violence in and
around Gaza. The situation is extremely worrisome.
Our focus must now be on avoiding further violent
escalation on the ground. All parties and, in particular,
Israeli security forces must exercise maximum restraint.

As we know from previous briefings in the
Chamber, the humanitarian situation in Gaza is terrible.
Gaza is on the verge of collapse. A sustainable solution
must urgently be sought, including an end to the Israeli
closure policy. Gaza is an integral part of the State of
Palestine and cannot be separated from the broader
political context, including the much needed peace
efforts leading to a two-State solution.
