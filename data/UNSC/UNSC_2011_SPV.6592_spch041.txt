Lieutenant General Prakash: The question that
I want to answer is whether a change of strategy is
required with respect to the protection of civilians by
the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(MONUSCO) in the pre- and post-electoral periods.

My view on the subject is that the present
strategy in place is working well. We have recently
taken a look at it. We have worked out modalities as to
how we are going operate. We have arranged various
contingencies to deal with various situations that may
arise. What clearly emerges is not that the strategy is
not in place, but that the enablers are not in place. For
example, there is a likelihood of armed groups ramping
up their activities and, as the elections approach, there
is likely to be more civil unrest. If such things are
going to happen, we will need more enablers. The
enablers need to come on time and to be in the right
place at the right time. As long as the enablers are
provided, I think there is no need to change strategy.
