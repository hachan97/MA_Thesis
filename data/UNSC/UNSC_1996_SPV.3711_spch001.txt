The President: The Council will now proceed to the
consideration of its annual report to the General Assembly,
the draft of which has been prepared by the Secretariat. I
wish to note that, in accordance with the decision taken in
June 1993, the Council's report is being considered in a
public meeting.

Members of the Council have before them the draft
report of the Security Council to the General Assembly for
the period 16 June 1995 to 15 June 1996, as circulated by
the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs on 5
November 1996, and corrigendum. I should like to express
appreciation to the Secretariat for the work it has
undertaken in preparing this factual report.

I now call on the Director of the Security Council
Affairs Division of the Secretariat to make an explanatory
statement.
