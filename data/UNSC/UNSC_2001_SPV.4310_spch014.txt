Mr. Bhatia (Singapore): We would like to echo
the eloquent opening remarks of the Permanent
Representative of Jamaica. She said that Under-
Secretary-General Guehenno's briefing and, indeed, the
comments made earlier by members, have dealt with
this issue fairly comprehensively. Hence, we shall
restrict our remarks to just two points.

First, in our View, the establishment of the
Temporary Security Zone marking the formal
separation of the two parties is indeed a welcome
development. Secondly, however, an outstanding area
of concern, as Mr. Guehenno mentioned this morning,
remains the restriction of movement imposed on the
personnel of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia
and Eritrea (UNMEE) in certain areas. Incidents
involving UNMEE patrols such as the one that
occurred on 7 April are cause for concern. In this
regard, we would like to know from Mr. Annabi
whether the pattern of restrictions and incidents has
eased up in recent weeks, or whether it has intensified.
Has any plan of action been adopted by UNMEE to
deal with this issue?
