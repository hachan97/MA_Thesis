Mr. Lacroix (France) (spoke in French): My
delegation would like to thank you, Mr. President, for
having brought the situation in South Ossetia, Georgia,
to the attention of the Council at the request of the
Russian Federation and of Georgia. A clear threat to
peace and security is posed, and we are particularly
concerned at the risk of an escalation of violence.
Under these circumstances, it is legitimate and urgent
that our Council should be seized of the matter. We
hope that, to the greatest extent possible, the Security
Council will be able to rapidly speak with one voice on
the situation. France is alarmed by the serious incidents
that are taking place, all the more so because in this
situation of confusion the information we have
indicates numerous victims on both sides.

What is certain is that for all the parties to the
conflict the military option offers no way out. France
therefore calls on the parties and on all those who have
a decisive influence on them, first of all, immediately
to cease hostilities on the ground; secondly,
immediately to resume dialogue, with a View to a
ceasefire by which each party must make all of its
forces abide; and finally, to cooperate fully with the
mission of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). France fully supports
the search for a political solution, with respect for the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia.

To conclude, I would like to recall that France
currently holds the presidency of the European Union,
as Council members know. The European Union very
recently recalled that it was determined to spare no
effort in helping the parties to attain a lasting solution.
