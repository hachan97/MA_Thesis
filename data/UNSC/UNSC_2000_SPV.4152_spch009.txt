Mr. Shen Guofang (China) (spoke in Chinese): I
should like to make a few comments on the no-fly
zone.

China's opposition to the no-fly zone is known to
all. China has never recognized the so-called no-fly
zone. We believe that the report to be submitted by the
independent experts should address the impact of the
so-called no-fly zone. The report which the resolution
requests the Secretary-General to submit should offer
an exhaustive analysis of the impact of the sanctions on
Iraq.

Whether or not the bombing has deliberately
targeted civilians of Iraq, it has brought them suffering.
That is an objective reality. We believe that the
independent experts to be appointed by the Secretary-
General must take this factor into consideration in their
future work.

The Chinese delegation's vote in favour of the
resolution should not be taken to indicate that we will
change our position in this regard in the future.
