Mr. Osorio (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I
wish to join my colleagues in hailing you, Madame
President, and commending you on taking on the
presidency of the Security Council. I wish you the
greatest of success. You will have our full support. I
would also like to thank the President last month, the
Ambassador of Lebanon, and his entire team for the
extraordinary guidance of our work.

My delegation voted in favour of the draft
resolution proposed by Germany, France, Portugal and
the United Kingdom. We are convinced that it is the
ideal and necessary means for urging the Syrian
authorities to immediately cease their violent offensive
against the civilian population so that an independent
inquiry can be launched into all human rights
violations committed during the protests and calling for
punishment of those responsible for violence in all its
forms.

The primary responsibility of the Government of
Syria is to protect its population. It has not done so -
much to the contrary. We are aware that the solution to
the crisis in that country will come through a political
process that effectively bears in mind the legitimate
aspirations of the people. However, it is first and
foremost necessary that their fundamental freedoms
and human rights be respected.

We regret that the Security Council did not adopt
this text and that the veto was used to reject it. After
several months of negotiations the non-imposition of
sanctions was attempted; that was a concession. Also,
the Syrian authorities were urged to move ahead with
the reforms, which have still not been implemented.
