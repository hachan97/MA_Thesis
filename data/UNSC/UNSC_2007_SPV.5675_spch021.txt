Mr. Schwarz-Schilling: I was impressed by the
statements made by colleagues in the Council. I believe
that there is a broad consensus about the way forward,
the principle of ownership and the principle of

transition to the European Union, but also about the
tasks remaining for the international community in
assisting and facilitating that process. I also wish to
thank speakers for their kind words about my work.

Finally, I want to make a personal comment. In
my capacity as a member of the Deutsche Bundestag
and Chairman of the Committee on Human Rights and
Humanitarian Aid, I made certain appeals to the
Security Council. I tried very hard to draw attention to
things that deserved to be seen and things to come in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. So it is very moving
experience for me to sit here today and to have had the
opportunity to work in and serve that country, which
has suffered so much, and to see the efforts of the
international community to ensure that it has the best
possible future. And we need to do that; it is not only a
legal question, but a moral obligation.

I wish all the best to my successor on this very
difficult path. It is difficult because the problems are
much deeper than in other areas, and they can be
solved only if we come together with the local
leadership. I am very much encouraged by the
leadership of Prime Minister Spiric': his approach, his
moral stance and what he has accomplished. I hope that
more political leaders in Bosnia and Herzegovina will
truly support him, because we have a great chance, an
historic window of opportunity, to achieve our goal:
facilitating the way forward towards the European
Union and the Euro-Atlantic partnership.

I thank Council members for their kind words and
for all their help. I will continue to be of service to
Bosnia and Herzegovina.
