Mr. De Riviere (France) (spoke in French): I hope that we are going to be able to move on from procedural matters to a substantive discussion on the chemical issues before us. Our Chinese colleague has just raised a timely question worthy of discussion. Why do we invite such and such a person and not another? That is a good question. But for the moment I think we need to focus on what is arather simple matter - the rules of procedure of the Council. With respect to the case before us today, the relevant rule is rule 39, and its reads very clearly. I will read it out in English to avoid any misunderstanding. (spoke in English) "The Security Council may invite members of the Secretariat or other persons, whom it considers competent for the purpose, to supply it with information or to give other assistance in examining matters within its competence." (spoke in French) Mr. President, you wish to invite an additional briefer. You need the support of the Council to do so. You therefore need nine votes. I do not think there is any reason to prevaricate here. It is quite clear. To claim otherwise is what we would call a specious argument or, in philosophy, sophistry. Rule 39 is absolutely crystal clear. If you wish to invite an additional briefer but there is no agreement, we vote on your proposal and, for it to be accepted, you need nine votes. It is a procedural vote. Rule 39 is as simple as that, and I recall that all permanent members Against: were in agreement on this. Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, United
