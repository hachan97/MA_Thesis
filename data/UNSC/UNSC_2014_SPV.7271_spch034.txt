The President: We appreciate Turkey's efforts and
also, obviously, the comments about Syria as a front-
line border State. As Mr. Frank-Walter Steinmeier said,
Turkey's efforts will be critical. We look forward to
working with your country.

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Jose'
Manuel Garcia Margallo, Minister for Foreign Affairs
of Spain.
