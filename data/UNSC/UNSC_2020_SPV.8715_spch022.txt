Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): Today we are discussing the question of the situation in Syria, as requested by the delegations of three countries. Today's discussion directly affects the Syrian Arab Republic. This is not an open debate today at which 120 Members of the United Nations take the floor. The five-minute rule is not even a rule; it is a recommendation. The speaker who holds the floor is the representative of the country whose situation is being discussed in the Security Council. It is therefore not right to stop his statement by invoking time limits or any other artificial reason. As President of the Security Council, Sir, I believe that you should show respect to the representative who is making a statement on behalf of the country currently being considered by the Security Council.
