Mr. Abarry (Niger) (spoke in French): On behalf of South Africa, Tunisia and the Niger, I welcome the adoption of resolution 2507 (2020), renewing the sanctions regime imposed on the Central African Republic. We take this opportunity to thank all members of the Security Council for the text, which is the product of constructive negotiations and the assiduous work of the penholder. We also commend and support the efforts of the Government of the Central African Republic to implement all the measures taken to restore peace and stability in the country. We would like to highlight two points with respect to the resolution. First, we stress that the sanctions regime must represent not an objective in itself, but rather our commitment to the country's transition towards peace and stability and peace. Secondly, the adoption of the resolution is thus a response to the legitimate request of the authorities of the Central African Republic to pursue the definitive lifting of the arms embargo on the basis of progress made in the area of storing and preventing the diversion of weapons. The resolution that we have just adopted will pave the way for the re-equipping of the entire defence and security apparatus so that the authorities of the Central African Republic can regain control of the entire country and confront the armed groups that continue to pose a threat to peace and stability. Finally, the three African members of the Security Council stress the need to support the Central African Republic, in coordination with all regional partners, in its efforts to stabilize the country and promote its socioeconomic recovery, and encourage it to further increase cooperation with its partners.
