Mr. Mottaghi Nejad (Islamic Republic of Iran) (spoke in French): I know it is late and that we are all
exhausted after the long debate in this Chamber today.
Our debate was essentially on the developments in the
Middle East. But I ask the Council to be bear with me
for a few moments, so that I may respond to what the
representative of Canada said regarding my country.

Canada has once again abused the Council by
making completely impertinent accusations against
my country during today's debate. In its speech, it
referred in particular to our nuclear programme, which
is essentially aimed at producing energy and electricity.
It is regrettable that the representative of Canada forgot
to say that Israel is the only country in our region that
possesses nuclear weapons.

(spoke in English)

Turning to the allegations regarding human rights,
I should say that, unfortunately, the countries claiming
to be the bulwark of democracy and champions of
human rights are suffering from political paranoia
and manipulating human rights issues to achieve their
politicized and biased goals, while, on the contrary, it
is well documented by the international human rights
monitoring bodies that their own records in this field
are seriously tainted.

Canada is a prime example in that regard. The fact
that human rights in Canada have been systematically
denied to large parts of its population, irrespective of
the political ideology of the different Governments and
political parties in power, is well known. From failing
in the scope of its international obligations, to failing
in a constitutional and legislative framework, to failing
in equality and non-discrimination, the right to life,
liberty and the security ofpersons, to failing minorities
and indigenous persons 7 there seems to be no area
where Canada has not disgraced itself before humanity

when it comes to upholding human rights. I think that
that is enough for tonight.
