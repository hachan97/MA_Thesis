Mr. Akahori (Japan): Japan is in favour of the
renewal of the mandate of the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint
Investigative Mechanism (JIM) by 18 days while it

considers a further extension. The JIM. has conducted
its work in an impartial, objective and independent
manner and identified those responsible for the use of
chemical weapons in four cases. On the other hand, it
is very regrettable that another 14 allegations have been
reported to the Joint Investigative Mechanism in the
past 30 days, according to Ms. Gamba, Head ofthe JIM.

The international norm of prohibiting chemical
weapons must remain solid. We need to continue efforts
to uncover the whole picture of the alleged uses of
chemical weapons in Syria and hold accountable those
responsible. The JIM. still has a major role to play. Japan
is in favour of a further extension of the JIM. mandate
beyond the 18 days and intends to be actively engaged
in the Council's consideration.
