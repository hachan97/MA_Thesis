The President (spoke in French): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Following consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council strongly condemns the
criminal act by the Uniao Nacional Para a
Independencia Total de Angola (UNITA) against
commercial aircraft, namely the shooting down of an
Antonov-26 aircraft on 12 May 1999 near Luzamba
and the taking hostage of its Russian crew, while the
fate of its Angolan passengers remains unknown.

"The Security Council expresses its grave
concern at the fate of those who were on board the
downed aircraft, demands the immediate and
unconditional release of the Russian crew members
and all other foreign nationals that may be held
hostage by UNITA in Angola, and demands also
information on the fate of the Angolan passengers.
It stresses that UNITA and its leader Mr. Jonas
SaVimbi carry full responsibility for their security.

"The Security Council calls upon the
Government of Angola and all other concerned
parties to cooperate in obtaining the release of the
Russian crew members as well as in ascertaining the
fate of passengers and crew members of other
commercial aircraft lost under suspicious
circumstances over UNITA-controlled territory.

"The Security Council will remain actively
seized of the matter."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/ 1999/14.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda. The
Security Council will remain seized of the matter.
The meeting rose at 1.45 p.m.
