The President: I thank Mr. Holmes for his
brieflng. On behalf of the Council, I would like to
express our profound gratitude to Under-Secretary-

appearance before the Council. Since his appointment by
the Secretary-General in January 2007, we have
appreciated Under-Secretary-General Holmes" leadership
as the head of the Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief
Coordinator, his forthright interaction with the
Council, and his deep compassion in handling very
important issues. We wish him all the best in his future
8
endeavours. I am sure that Council members will add
their respective voices in a special tribute to
Mr. Holmes as we bid him farewell.

I now give the floor to Ms. Navanethem Pillay.
