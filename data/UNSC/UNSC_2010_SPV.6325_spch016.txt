Mr. Issoze-Ngondet (Gabon) (spoke in French): I
wish to welcome the presence of the Minister for
Foreign Affairs of Turkey as well as of the Deputy
Secretary-General and to thank Assistant Secretary-
General Fernandez-Taranco for his briefing.

My delegation learned with great regret of the
attack by Israeli forces against a flotilla carrying
humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip, which
caused more than ten deaths and a number of people
wounded, including peace activists travelling with the
flotilla. Gabon regrets the many deaths and takes this
opportunity to convey our profound condolences to the
bereaved families. We reiterate our support to
humanitarian organizations that are working in Gaza
and in Palestine in general.

This new violence is unacceptable under
international law and has already revived tensions that
put at risk the indirect talks between Palestinians and
Israelis that had started three weeks ago. Along with
the rest of the international community, my delegation
firmly condemns these attacks, which are a hindrance
to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. In that regard,
we support the Secretary-General's call for an
international investigation to clarify the circumstances
of the raid.

This new situation reminds us once again of the
urgency of lifting the Gaza blockade, in accordance
with resolution 1860 (2009). Gabon calls on the parties
to refrain from all provocation which could cause an
escalation of violence in the region. We also call upon
the parties to heed the international community and do
everything possible to resume the peace talks. We
support the draft presidential statement on this matter.
