The President (China) (spoke in Chinese): I shall
now make a brief statement in my capacity as the
representative of China.

We would like to congratulate the Afghan people
on the election of their new national leader. China
hopes that the new Afghan Government can be
established and carry out its functions as soon as
possible. We support the Afghan Government's efforts
to bring stability to the country. We hope that the
international community will further increase its efforts
to actively assist the Government in strengthening the
capacity-building of the army and the police so as to
enable them to assume the responsibility for security at
an early date.

We support the Afghan Government and people in
their efforts to promote steady social and economic
development and to improve people's livelihoods, and
we call on the international community to provide
more support and assistance in view of the country's
development needs. We hope that the international
conferences on Afghanistan, to be held in Istanbul,
London and Kabul, will achieve positive and concrete
results.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

I give the floor to the representative of Canada.
