The President: The Security Council will now resume
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations. Members of the Council have before
them the report of the Secretary-General submitted pursuant
to paragraph 16 of Security Council resolution 883 (1993)
and paragraph 8 of resolution 1192 (1998), document
S/1999/726.

I should like also to draw the attention of the members
of the Council to document S/1999/752, which contains the
text of a letter dated 6 July 1999 from the Permanent
Representative of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to the United
Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council.

Following consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council recalls its resolutions 731
(1992) of 21 January 1992, 748 (1992) of 31 March
1992, 883 (1993) of 11 November 1993 and 1192
(1998) of 27 August 1998 and the statement of its
President of 8 April 1999 (S/PRST/1999/10).

"The Security Council welcomes the report of
the Secretary-General of 30 June 1999 (S/1999/726)
in fulfilment of the request contained in paragraph
16 of resolution 883 (1993).

"The Security Council welcomes the positive
developments identified in the report and the fact
that the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has made
significant progress in compliance with the relevant
resolutions. It welcomes also the commitment given
by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to implement further
the relevant resolutions by continuing cooperation in
order to meet all the requirements contained therein.
It encourages all parties concerned to maintain their
spirit of cooperation. The Council recalls that the
measures set forth in resolutions 748 (1992) and 883
(1993) have been suspended and reaffirms its
intention to lift those measures as soon as possible,
in conformity with the relevant resolutions.

"The Security Council expresses its gratitude to
the Secretary-General for his continued efforts in his
role as set out in paragraph 4 of resolution 731
(1992) and paragraph 6 of resolution 1192 (1998)
and requests him to follow developments regarding
this matter closely and to report to the Council
accordingly.

"The Security Council remains actively seized
of the matter."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/1999/22.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 5 pm.
