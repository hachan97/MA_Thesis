Mr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese):
At the outset, let me once again congratulate
Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf on her election to the
presidency of Liberia. I also thank her for her
important statement.

In recent times, the new administration of Liberia
has taken a series of reform measures in all areas in its
tireless effort towards economic reconstruction and
national rehabilitation, and has achieved positive
progress. That represents a victory for the Liberian
people and the United Nations. As a friend of Liberia,
the Chinese Government and people are sincerely
pleased by that success. We also believe that, under the
leadership of President Johnson-Sirleaf, all the parties
of Liberia will unite and achieve the lasting peace and
economic revitalization of their country in rapid
course.

China has always supported and appreciated the
positive role played by the United Nations, and
especially the United Nations Mission in Liberia, in
maintaining the stability of Liberia and in
development. Following the establishment of the new
administration, the United Nations and the
international community should continue to assist the
new Government in its efforts towards national
reconciliation. China will always support and
participate in the work in that field.
