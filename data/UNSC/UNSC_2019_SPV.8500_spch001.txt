The President: I wish to warmly welcome the
Ministers and other representatives present in the
Security Council Chamber. Their presence today
underscores the importance of the subject matter
under discussion.

In accordance with rule 39 of the Council's provisional
rules of procedure, I invite the following briefers to
participate in this meeting: Mrs. Izumi Nakamitsu,
Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for
Disarmament Affairs, and Mr. Yukiya Amano, Director
General of the International Atomic Energy Agency.

The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda.

I shall now make several remarks in my national
capacity.

Today's meeting is a timely opportunity to take
stock of the achievements made under the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and lay
the ground for future progress. As we move towards the
2020 Review Conference against a challenging security
background, the Security Council can, and should,
make its contribution to its successful outcome in 2020.
I would like to highlight that the Council is made up
not only of the five nuclear-weapon States recognized
by the NPT, including all three depositary States, but
also 10 non-nuclear-weapon States that are firmly
committed to the goals ofthe NPT; some ofthem are also
dedicated members of different nuclear-weapon-free
zones. That composition underlines the responsibility
of the Security Council for the NPT and the relevance
of the exchange that we are having today. Advancing
the goals of the NPT across its three pillars - nuclear
disarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful uses
of nuclear applications - is at the core of members'
assignments. We are grateful for their presence, and we
look forward to hearing their statements.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council.

I give the floor to Mrs. Nakamitsu.
