Mr. Harrison (United Kingdom): My delegation
would like to join others in thanking the Secretary-General
for his report, and also in thanking Mr. Annabi for his very
clear briefing at the beginning of this meeting.

We are pleased that the transition period in Tajikistan
is drawing to a close. The main task for us all now is to
consolidate the peace and avoid any future breakdown of
the arrangements that have been successfully put in place.
We are also pleased that the United Nations Mission of
Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) has provided critical
support to the peace process, and we are pleased that the
elections took place successfully, as noted by the Joint
Electoral Observation Mission (JEOM). They were the first
multi-party elections to take place in an atmosphere free
of violence, which represents a real landmark in the
history of Tajikistan. Nevertheless, we are concerned that
the elections failed to meet the minimum democratic
standards for equal, free, transparent and accountable
elections, and we urge the Government, the Parliament
and all political forces in Tajikistan to work towards fully
fair and free elections in the future.

We also await with interest the outcome of the
Secretary-General' s consultations with the Government of
Tajikistan on a follow-on political presence. We would
not wish to prejudge the results of these discussions, but
we do support the Secretary-General's conclusion that it
is important for the international community to remain
engaged in Tajikistan.
