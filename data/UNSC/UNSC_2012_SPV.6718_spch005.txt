Mr. Manjeev Singh Puri (India): The African
Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) is today the
mainstay of the efforts of the international community
to stabilize the security situation in Somalia. We
strongly commend the countries contributing troops to
AMISOM. for their commitment to the Mission and for
the sacrifices their men have made.

Despite its limited resources, AMISOM. has made
significant achievements in the implementation of its
mandate over the past year. The Mission therefore
deserves more support from the international
community. In that connection, we welcome
AMISOM's new strategic concept, developed jointly
by the African Union and the United Nations. We think
that the full implementation of that concept has the
potential to accelerate the stabilization of the security
situation in Somalia. That, in turn, will facilitate
political stabilization and also improve the socio-
economic and humanitarian situations.

We voted in favour of resolution 2036 (2012)
today because it strengthens AMISOM. and provides it
with more predictable and sustainable resources,
including force enablers and multipliers. We are
disappointed, however, that the resolution does not
include naval assets for contingent-owned equipment
reimbursement. We are of the view that the proposed
maritime component of AMISOM, limited as it is, is
integral to the new strategic concept and thus to the
success of the Mission. The pacification of the Somali
coastline is essential not only to depriving Al-Shabaab
of port revenues and export earnings, but also to
dealing with the ever-increasing menace of piracy and
hostage-taking. We therefore expect that the Council
will address this shortcoming when it next considers
AMISOM's mandate.
