Ms. Wronecka (Poland): I would like to thank the
representative of the United Kingdom for his initiative
to convene today's meeting.

Poland is gravely concerned about the use of a
nerve agent in an attempt to murder Mr. Sergei Skripal
and Ms. Yulia Skripal, which endangered the lives of
innocent civilians. Poland has always been a committed
supporter of curbing chemical weapons. In that regard,
we condemn the unprecedented attack on the territory
of the United Kingdom - the first of its kind in Europe
since the Second World War. After the continued use
of chemicals as weapons in Syria, this is another clear
example of the violation of international law and the
provisions of the Convention on the Prohibition of
the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of
Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction.

We express our full solidarity with the British
people and Government and our readiness to support
our close ally and European partner in the conduct
of the investigation. At the same time, we call on
Russia to address the United Kingdom's questions and
appropriately cooperate with the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in that regard. Poland
strongly believes that there is no place for impunity.
Those responsible for the use of chemical weapons
must be held accountable.
