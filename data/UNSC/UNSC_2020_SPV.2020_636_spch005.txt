I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo for her comprehensive briefing. I also welcome the participation of our friends from Egypt, the Sudan and Ethiopia at this meeting. All three stakeholders - Egypt, the Sudan and Ethiopia - have legitimate interests in the Nile River and its water resources. We therefore remain convinced that the issue of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam can be amicably resolved only through direct talks and understanding among the three countries. In that regard, we particularly welcome the resumption of the dialogue at the meeting held by the African Union Bureau on 26 June, and we welcome the subsequent commitment of the parties to finding a peaceful negotiated solution to all outstanding issues. The African Union Bureau meeting was a positive step. We urge the parties to maintain the course and encourage them, first, to continue the talks in good faith; secondly, to make necessary concessions; and, thirdly, to reach a tripartite agreement that is beneficial to all three countries. We hope that the parties can reach an agreement in the coming weeks, as envisioned by the African Union process. We remain committed to supporting the process in constructive ways. Rivers can be a source of conflict or a source of cooperation. It is up to the parties to determine how they choose to proceed. Right now, there is a historic opportunity for the parties to lead by example. Through the spirit of empathy and understanding, they can show the rest of the world how a source of potential conflict could be turned into cooperation, which is a result where everyone would win. We are counting on their leadership.
