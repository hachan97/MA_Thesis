Mr. Ondo Angue (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in Spanish): At the outset, I would like to thank the
United States, as penholder for resolution 2494 (2019),
for introducing the draft text and ensuring that it took
into account the range of views expressed by Council
members as well as those of the parties involved.

Equatorial Guinea decided to vote in favour of
resolution 2494 (2019), thereby affirming its full support
for the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in
Western Sahara (MINURSO) and its Head, Special
Representative of the Secretary-General Colin Stewart.
We consider the progress made by the former Personal
Envoy very important and therefore want to stress how
crucial it is that his successor builds on Mr. Kohler's
efforts and takes into account the commitment by all
parties to holding a third meeting in the same format.

The Republic of Equatorial Guinea believes
that regardless of the long drawn-out nature of the
situation, peace can be achieved only through a frank
and inclusive dialogue based on a realistic, practicable
and enduring political solution in order to put an end to
the conflict.

By way of conclusion, the Republic of Equatorial
Guinea would like to commend the achievements
registered by the Kingdom of Morocco in promoting
human rights through the various steps and initiatives
it has carried out and for the role played by the
National Council on Human Rights Commissions,
operating in Dakhla and Laayoune, and the interaction
between Morocco and the Special Procedures of the
Human Rights Council, as reflected in the nineteenth
preambular paragraph of the resolution.

This could be the last time during our membership
of the Council that we will discuss the issue of
MINURSO. If so, we would like to wish for every
success and a definitive solution for the good of all the
parties involved, the international community and the
United Nations as the body entrusted with guaranteeing
international peace and security for a better world.
