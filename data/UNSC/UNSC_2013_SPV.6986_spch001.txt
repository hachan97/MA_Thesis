The President: As this is the last meeting of the
Security Council that will be attended by our colleague
Susan Rice, who has been the Permanent Representative
of the United States of America to the United Nations for
the past four and a half years, I would like to mark the
occasion by saying, on behalf of all the members of the
Council, that we have greatly appreciated the immense
contribution that she has made to the Council's work
over that time. On behalf of all of us, I wish her well
in her new position as National Security Adviser. As
she may be the first National Security Adviser to have
been educated at Oxford University, she is certainly
extremely well qualified for the job and we wish her
well in it.
