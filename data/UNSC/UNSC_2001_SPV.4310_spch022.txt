The President: I thank the Assistant Secretary-
General for the clarifications he has provided.

I think that the Secretariat has taken away a sense
of the Council's views on this subject, but I would also
like the Assistant Secretary-General to convey the
warm appreciation of the Council for the work that the
Special Representative and the whole of the United
Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) are
doing on the ground. We very much applaud the
progress that they have made.

The Security Council has concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Security Council will remain seized of the matter.

The meeting rose at 4.10pm.
