Mr. Apakan (Turkey): I will be brief. We had not
intended to take the floor again, but we find ourselves
obliged to do so.

I have listened to my colleague, the Permanent
Representative of Syria. I think an attempt was made
to represent the facts about our position with regard to
Syria. In that respect, the crisis in Syria, which is, for
us, a threat to regional and global peace and security,
does not need further description. That is taking place
right before our eyes.

As a country that neighbours Syria and shares not
only a long border but also a long history and close
cultural ties, we have always stood for the security,
stability and prosperity of Syria. Its territorial integrity
and national unity is sacrosanct for all of us. What
could be a more relevant and important vested interest
for Turkey than bringing an end to the crisis in Syria
without further delay? We will continue to stand by the
Syrian people, who must be the masters of their own
future. We will never leave them in the cold.
