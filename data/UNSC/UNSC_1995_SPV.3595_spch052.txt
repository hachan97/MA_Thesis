Mr. Londofio-Paredes (Colombia) (interpretation from Spanish): I have the honour to address the Security
Council on behalf of my Government, in its capacity as
President of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.
May I, first of all, congratulate you, Mr. President, on
your assumption of the presidency of this important organ
for the month of November.

The Presidency of the Movement of Non-Aligned
Countries welcomed with satisfaction the announcement
of the Agreement concluded in Dayton, Ohio, which
makes it possible to achieve the long-awaited peace in the
Balkan region. The attainment of peace has been one of
the Movement's most serious concerns. Furthermore,
many of its members have worked actively and in
different ways to achieve it. It is now our hope that the
Agreements reached will be completed and, in particular,
that they will be implemented properly so that peace may
at last be restored where bloodshed and barbarity have
prevailed. The Presidency of the N on-Aligned Movement
wishes to pay a tribute to all of those who gave their lives
for the attainment of peace and to the countries of the
Contact Group. In particular, we express appreciation for
the efforts made by the Government of the United States
to achieve this success, which is also that of the entire
international community. We will be vigilant and attentive
to ensure that the aim and goal of the Agreement - the

 

attainment of a lasting and stable peace in the region -
may become a reality.
