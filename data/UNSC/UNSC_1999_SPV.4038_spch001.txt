The President: I should like to inform the Council
that I have received letters from the representatives of
Australia, Finland, Indonesia, New Zealand and Portugal in
which they request to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives to
participate in the discussion without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and
rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Wibisono
(Indonesia) and Mr. Monteiro (Portugal) took seats at
the Council table; Ms. Wensley (Australia), Ms. Rasi
(Finland); and Mr. Powles (New Zealand) took the
seats reserved for them at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The President: The Security Council will now begin
its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its
prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the report
of the Secretary-General, document S/ 1999/862.

The first speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Portugal, and I now call on him.
