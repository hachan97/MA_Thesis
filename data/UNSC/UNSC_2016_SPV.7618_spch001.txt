The President (Spoke in Spanish): In accordance
with rule 39 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure, I invite Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, Under-
Secretary-General for Political Affairs, to participate
in this meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members to
document S/2016/92, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the threat posed by ISIL (Da'esh)
to international peace and security and the range of
United Nations efforts in support of Member States in
countering the threat.

I now give the floor to Mr. Feltman.
