Mr. Roed-Larsen: I have taken note of the fact
that many members of the Council share my deep
concern and sadness over the new bloodshed and the
deepening crisis in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
However, it has been both heartening and encouraging
to hear so many members supporting the efforts of the
Quartet, as well as to hear voices agreeing that, in
order to restart, we have to speed up the road map
process - moving from baby steps, if I may say so, to
bigger and bolder steps. I have also taken note of the
fact that, despite deep differences, both the Palestinian
and the Israeli representative here - although with
very different perspectives - still keep the road map
as their reference point.

New confidence between the parties has to be
shaped through deeds. I would like to emphasize that
those have to address the two main concerns, namely,
territory and terrorism. At this stage, I believe no
Palestinian leader can put an end to all forms of terror
without broad popular support for the necessary and
painful security measures that have to be taken.
However, such popular support can only be mustered
through the Palestinian people seeing, in real terms, at
least the beginning of the end of the occupation. That
means, in operational terms, starting the vacating of
settlements and halting work on the wall. On the other
hand, no Prime Minister can muster popular support for
territorial concessions under waves of terrorist attacks
murdering innocent civilians.

As I see it, only simultaneous, reciprocal steps -
where one side concedes land and the other stops
terror - can bring us back to the path of the road map
and lead us rapidly forwards to the defined end-goals
of the road map.
