Mr. Pecsteen de Buytswerve (Belgium) (spoke in French): Belgium was compelled to vote against the
adoption of the agenda today. We have called several
times for today's meeting to be postponed for a few days,
for two reasons. First, there is a lack of information on
the law in question and we wanted delegations to be
able to prepare as well as possible. Secondly, as has
been noted, the new President of Ukraine took office
today. We do not feel that holding a briefing on the very
day he takes office creates an environment conducive to
resuming dialogue. We regret that such considerations
were not taken into account, which is what led us to
vote against holding a briefing today.
