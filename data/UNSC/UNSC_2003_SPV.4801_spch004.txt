Mr. Raytchev (Bulgaria): Bulgaria welcomes the
fact that it was possible to reach a consensus on the
proposed text for the resolution just adopted. We would
like to express our deep conviction that, on the basis of
the resolution, both parties will work towards a
mutually acceptable solution.

I wish also to take this opportunity to express our
appreciation to the Secretary-General and to his
Personal Envoy for their tireless efforts to find a
solution to the problem.
