The President (spoke in Russian): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Germany and the Islamic
Republic of Iran in which they request to be invited to
participate in the consideration of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
consideration of the item without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Khazaee
(Islamic Republic of Iran) took a seat at the
Council table; Mr. Matussek (Germany) took the
seat reserved for him at the side of the Council
Chamber

The President (spoke in Russian): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with
the understanding reached in the course of its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2008/141, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by France, Germany and the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

I wish to draw the attention of the members of the
Council to document S/2008/116, which contains the
text of identical letters dated 22 February 2008 from
the Permanent Representative of the Islamic Republic
of Iran addressed to the Secretary-General and the
President of the Security Council.

I give the floor to the representative of the
Islamic Republic of Iran.
