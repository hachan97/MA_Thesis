Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): I would
like to thank Assistant Secretary-General Fernandez-
Taranco for his briefing.

China is deeply worried about the recent escalation
of the situation in Ukraine. We hope that the relevant
parties will remain calm, exercise restraint and avoid
any further deterioration of the situation.

Settling the question of Ukraine involves the
interests and concerns of all parties. It should be
considered in a balanced manner. Political and
diplomatic channels should continue to be pursued in
order to narrow differences and settle the issue within
the framework of law and order. China has consistently
called on the international community to make
constructive efforts and employ good offices to ease
the situation in Ukraine, and will continue to support
the international community in those endeavours.
