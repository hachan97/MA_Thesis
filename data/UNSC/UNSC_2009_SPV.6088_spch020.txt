Ms. Bakoyannis: I would just like to thank all
the members of the Security Council for their
encouraging words and their support. The year 2009
will be a difficult and challenging one for the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. I
can only promise that the Chairperson-in-Office will
spare no effort to act as an honest broker and will count
on members' goodwill and support as we make
decisions and seek agreements. As members know, we
need to work by consensus, so we will really need all
the Council's support.
