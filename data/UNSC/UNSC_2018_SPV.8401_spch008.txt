Mr. Cohen (United States of America): I thank
Ambassador Delattre for France's efforts to find
compromise language on a difficult draft resolution and
to adopt a technical rollover (resolution 2446 (2018).

The United States supports the addition of a new
task in the next mandate that would enable the United
Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization
Mission in the Central African Republic to provide
limited logistical support to the Central African military,
police and gendarmerie, using existing resources. We
thank the members of the Council for supporting the
technical rollover, which will give the United States
the time required for full notification within our
Government, as required by United States law.

The United States has also expressed concern
about language in the draft resolution regarding the
International Criminal Court, which was addressed by
the penholder in the text put into the blue and to be
adopted after the technical rollover has expired.
