Mr. Garcia (Colombia) (interpretation from Spanish):
That we should be discussing the situation in the Middle
East for the second time in one day is indicative of the
clear difficulties being experienced by the peace process
in that region.

We have been witnessing with concern the
deterioration of the situation in Lebanon as a result of the
attacks carried out by Israeli forces.

For some time, in keeping with the position adopted
by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, my country
has stated that the prerequisite for peace and security in
the region is strict respect for the territorial integrity,
sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within
its internationally recognized borders. The Heads of State
or Government made statements to that effect at the Non-
Aligned summit in Cartagena, condemning the Israeli
occupation of the southern part of the territory of
Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley, while also expressing
their support for efforts aimed at, inter alia, liberating
those territories.
We have listened with great attention to the
statement of the Permanent Representative of Lebanon.
The attacks against Lebanon are not only a violation of
the norms of international law, taking an irreparable toll
in human life and material damage and causing an exodus
of innocent civilians; they also, in general, gravely
endanger the progress of the peace process in the Middle
East.

My delegation therefore reiterates that only the
prompt and unconditional implementation of Security
Council resolution 425 (1978) will create an environment
favourable to peace and international security in the
region. We call for the attacks to cease and for a climate
favourable to a peaceful, negotiated outcome to the crisis
to be created.
