Mr. Mejdoub (Tunisia) (spoke in French): Allow
me first of all, on this tragic day, to express my
country's deep sympathies to the United States, an old
friend of Tunisia's for over 200 years. President
Ben Ali has conveyed his condolences to President
Bush and has stated Tunisia's categorical
condemnation of these acts.

We extend our compassion and solidarity to
Ambassador Jim Cunningham, the delegation of the
United States and the grieving American nation. We
extend our deepest condolences to the countless
families that are being so sorely tested at this time. We
share their deep emotion and grief.

Yesterday's tragedy is an unacceptable crime, one
which has afflicted innocent people. No civilization
condones, and no cause whatever can justify, the
odious crime perpetrated in three cities of this country
on Tuesday, 11 September, just as the United Nations
was preparing to ring the Peace Bell for the new
millennium commencing this year. Taking place on the
very day of the opening of the General Assembly, this
brutal and malicious attack is both an outrage and a
challenge to the entire international community.

We therefore condemn in the most forceful way
the authors of this tragedy, both the perpetrators
themselves and those who ordered it. It is time for all
societies of the international community to root out this
madness and to cooperate on both preventing and
combating terrorism and organized crime.

In the light of dreadful events such as this, if we
want to succeed, we must act together. We will be
stronger if we are all united - a family united in a
spirit of solidarity.
