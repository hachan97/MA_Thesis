Mr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish):
Guatemala voted in favour of resolution 2042 (2012),
consistent with the position that we adopted from the
very beginning of the situation taking place in the
Syrian Arab Republic. We have always maintained that
the violence must cease immediately and that the only
way out is through a process of political dialogue led
by the Syrians themselves that leads to the reforms
demanded by the people.
Our support for this resolution is not only in
pursuit of those goals, but also heralds our full support
for the initiative of the Joint Special Envoy of the
United Nations and the League of Arab States,
Mr. Kofi Annan. Likewise, it reflects our continuing
support for the League of Arab States in seeking a
peaceful outcome to the situation that has brought us
together today.

My delegation considers today's resolution as an
opportunity, perhaps the only opportunity, to reverse
the spiral of violence and take a first step towards a
better future for all Syrian citizens.
