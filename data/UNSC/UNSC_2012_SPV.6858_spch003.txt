The President: I thank Ambassador Sangqu for his
briefing.

On behalf of the Council, I should like to express
appreciation to all members of the Security Council
and the Secretariat who participated in the mission for
the manner in which they discharged their important
responsibilities on behalf of the Council.

There are no more names inscribed on the list of
speakers, the Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
