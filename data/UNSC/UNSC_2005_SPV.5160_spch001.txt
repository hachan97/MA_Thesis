The President (spoke in Chinese): The Security
Council will now begin its consideration of the item on
its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them
document S/2005/203, which contains a letter dated 24
March 2005 from the Secretary-General transmitting
the report of the Fact-finding Mission to Lebanon.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2005/227, which contains the text of a
draft resolution submitted by Denmark, France,
Greece, Japan, Philippines, Romania, United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and United States

I should also like to draw the attention of
members of the Council to the following documents:
S/2005/208, letter dated 29 March 2005 from Lebanon
addressed to the Secretary-General; S/2005/209,

Arab Republic addressed to the Secretary-General and
the President of the Security Council; and S/2005/219,

Syrian Arab Republic addressed to the President of the
Security Council.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution. Unless I
hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to
the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

unanimously as resolution 1595 (2005).
