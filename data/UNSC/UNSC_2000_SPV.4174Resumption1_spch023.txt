The President: I thank the representative of
Rwanda for his kind words.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
Permanent Observer of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference, Mr. Mokhtar Lamani, to whom the
Council has extended an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure. I invite him to take a
seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
