Mr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): We
wish to thank you, Mr. President, and your team, as
well as the Permanent Representative of Sweden and
his team, for the tireless efforts made to achieve this
important consensus, and we also thank the members
of the Council for their flexibility. This commitment
will allow for an immediate cessation of hostilities
in Syria and the urgent and necessary provision of
humanitarian assistance.

We underscore the need to maintain unity within
the Council in terms of its responsibilities to protect the
civilian population, in accordance with international
law and international humanitarian law.

Peru, a sponsor of resolution 2401 (2017), which
we have just adopted, will closely monitor its urgent
implementation and compliance therewith by all parties
involved. We wish to express our sorrow concerning
and solidarity with the victims of the conflict in Syria,
and our support and admiration for the United Nations
humanitarian workers and those of other agencies
deployed on the ground. We hope that the important
step that we have taken today will help to achieve a
lasting solution to the Syrian conflict in line with
resolution 2254 (2015) and the Geneva communique
(S/2012/522, annex).
