Mr. Osvald (Sweden): I would first like to say that
we fully share the views expressed by the Netherlands on
behalf of the European Union a few minutes ago on the
situation in Liberia.

Sweden welcomes the progress made in the peace
process in Liberia. It is especially encouraging that the
security situation in the country has improved and that
there have been significant achievements in the
demobilization process.
 

The forthcoming elections will be an important step
towards democracy in Liberia. In this context, Sweden
welcomes the recommendations on a basic framework for
the elections, as endorsed by the Chairman of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The
timetable for the elections is, however, extremely tight. It
is imperative that the parties do their utmost to facilitate its
implementation.

It is important that the large number of Liberian
refugees be given the opportunity to cast their votes. The
prompt voluntary repatriation of refugees is therefore
essential.

The ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) has
played an important role in the Liberian peace process and
will continue to do so. ECOMOG will also play an
important role in the electoral process in ensuring the
security and protection of international personnel. In this
context too, we welcome the cooperation between
ECOMOG and UN OMIL.

Sweden believes that a prolongation of the mandate of
UNOMIL and an extension of its tasks in line with the
recommendations of the Secretary-General will promote the
process of peace and democracy in Liberia. We will
therefore vote in favour of the draft resolution now before
us.
