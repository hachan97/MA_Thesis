Mr. Kandeel (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Everyone
is aware of Egypt's position - we oppose the
nuclear-weapon programme in North Korea and that
country's ongoing violations of Security Council
resolutions - and there is therefore no need to repeat
it here. Moreover, everyone is also equally aware of
Egypt's commitment to the principles of the Charter of
the United Nations, among which I would mention the
sovereign equality of its Members and non-interference
in the internal affairs of States.

Egypt abstained today in the voting on the holding of
a meeting concerning internal matters in North Korea.
Egypt once again reiterates that the Security Council
is not the relevant international forum to address
internal affairs or human rights situation in countries,
unless the matter concerns acts of genocide or ethnic
cleansing, which have a direct impact on international
peace and security and require the Council to act as one
in fulfilling its tasks.

We warn that a continued determination to place
internal affairs on the agenda of the Security Council,
in spite of reservations on the part of a great number
of Member States and contrary to the very mandate
of the Council, undermines the Council's cohesion
and augments polarization among its members. That
effort also has a negative impact on the United Nations
being able to carry out its functions, as it erodes trust,
on the one hand, in the neutrality of the Organization
and its bodies and, on the other, among Member
States themselves.

Egypt also rejects a selective approach to human
rights situations in whatever country, which does not
contribute to fostering trust or providing an opportunity
to respond to genuine initiatives to resolve the root
causes of international crises and achieve international
peace and security.
