France welcomes the adoption of resolution 2557 (2020), the text of which renews the mandate of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011) and makes it possible to guarantee that the Team's work will continue and that, moreover, the sanctions regime is effective. Recent progress towards peace is encouraging, but much remains to be done. We expect all parties to engage constructively and in good faith in the negotiations when they resume. France would like to recall that, as provided for in resolution 2513 (2020), adopted on 10 March 2020, the Council is ready to review the 1988 Committee's sanctions list, but that this review will take place only in the light of the progress and the efforts made by the Taliban to reduce violence and cease carrying out or supporting activities that threaten the peace, stability and security of Afghanistan. The level of violence to date shows that these efforts have not been realized. France will continue to advocate the reduction of violence but also the preservation of democratic gains and the participation of women, in order to support the peace process and assist Afghanistan on the road to lasting peace.
