The President (spoke in French): In light of the
resolution just adopted, this was the last briefing by the
representatives of the United Nations Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission and of the
International Atomic Energy Agency presented to the
Council on the situation concerning Iraq. I wish
therefore, on behalf of the members of the Council, to
express our appreciation to the personnel of the
Commission and the Agency for their important
contributions in carrying out the mandates entrusted to
them by the Security Council.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda. The Council will remain seized of the matter.
The meeting rose at 11.45 am.
