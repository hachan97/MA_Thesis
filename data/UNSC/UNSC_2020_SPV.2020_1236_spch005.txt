China thanks President Agius and Prosecutor Brammertz for their briefings on the recent work of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals. Under the leadership of President Agius, the staff of the Mechanism have made every effort to overcome the impacts of the coronavirus disease. Since August, in-court proceedings have resumed and judicial activities have been well conducted. China commends the Mechanism for its efforts. During the reporting period, the Mechanism officially commenced pre-trial proceedings against Mr. Kabuga, one of the main suspects in the Rwandan genocide of 1994. That shows the resolve of the Mechanism to combat impunity and its efforts to advance the proceedings without delay. China commends the efforts of all parties, especially those of the Office of the Prosecutor. Pursuant to Security Council resolutions, the Mechanism is a small, temporary and efficient structure, whose size and function will diminish over time. We hope that the Mechanism will continue to carry out its work in accordance with Council resolutions, in particular to advance and complete all pending cases based on the projected timelines provided in the progress report. In doing so, it is important for the Mechanism to reasonably allocate budgetary resources to guarantee the priority of judicial activities. China hopes that, going forward, the Mechanism will continue to improve its work by implementing the recommendations made by the Council's Informal Working Group on International Tribunals and the United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services. We also hope that the Mechanism will work with the countries concerned to properly resolve the relocation of acquitted and released persons. In conclusion, I wish to take this opportunity to thank Viet Nam, Chair of the Council's Informal Working Group on International Tribunals, and the Office of the Legal Affairs of the United Nations for their efforts in coordinating the Council and the Mechanism.
