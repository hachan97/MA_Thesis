Ms. Rice (United States of America): We are very
pleased that the Council has unanimously adopted the
renewal of the mandate of the United Nations Mission
in the Sudan (UNMIS). The Council's vote reflects its
unwavering support for the work of the United Nations
in Southern Sudan. It also reflects the Council's
continued belief that the full implementation of the
2
Comprehensive Peace Agreement is vital to bringing
lasting peace to the people of Sudan.

After years of conflict and economic deprivation,
the citizens of Sudan deserve a future of peace and
promise. The Sudanese people are faced with many
challenges. We are concerned about the deterioration of
relations between Chad and Sudan. The relationship
between those two countries affects peace throughout
Sudan, and for that reason we welcome the Qatar- and
Libyan-sponsored bilateral talks in Doha between Chad
and Sudan as a positive step forward.

We remain, however, deeply concerned about the
negative impact on the three areas caused by the
Government of Sudan's 4 and 5 March expulsions of
13 international aid organizations, to say nothing of the
humanitarian needs in Darfur and the suffering that its
people will face as a result of the expulsions. The
United States believes that there is absolutely no
justification for the Government of Sudan's actions.
The sudden expulsions of the non-governmental
organizations put too many innocent civilians at grave
risk.

The Government of Sudan bears primary
responsibility for its people, and therefore we urge
Sudan to take immediate steps to restore effective
assistance to Sudan's most vulnerable civilians. We
fully support UNMIS as it continues its work by
helping to implement the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement, to protect vulnerable civilians and to assist
the people of Sudan to achieve a lasting peace.
