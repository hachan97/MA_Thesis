The President: There are no further speakers
inscribed on my list. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.

I take this opportunity, on behalf of the Security
Council, once again to thank Judge Meron, Judge
Mase, Prosecutor Del Ponte and Prosecutor Jallow for
taking the time to brief the Council today.

The meeting rose at 6.50p.m.
