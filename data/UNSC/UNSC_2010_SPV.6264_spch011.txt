Mr. Issoze-Ngondet (Gabon) (spoke in French):
At the outset, I would like to warmly welcome the
presence of His Excellency Mr. Boris Tadie, President
of the Republic of Serbia, a country with which my
country has excellent relations. I also welcome
Mr. Skender Hyseni and thank him for his kind words
on my country's election to the Security Council. I
would also like to thank the Special Representative of
the Secretary-General, Mr. Lamberto Zannier, for
presenting the Secretary-General's report (S/2010/5) of
5 January 2010 on the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). The
report has been submitted to us in accordance with
resolution 1244 (1999).

My delegation has very carefully read the
Secretary-General's report on the activities carried out
in Kosovo by UNMIK and by international
organizations working on the ground, as well as on
developments in the overall situation in the region. We
duly recognize UNMIK's important contribution to
promoting cooperation and reconciliation and to
maintaining security and stability in the region.

We therefore endorse keeping UNMIK in Kosovo
until the issue is resolved peacefully through dialogue
and negotiation. My delegation supports the Secretary-
General's six-point plan for Kosovo because we
believe that its constructive approach will be
invaluable to both parties. We also welcome the
involvement of the European Union in this process
through its Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo, NATO, the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
and the Kosovo Force.

As to Kosovo's status, Gabon values respect for
international rules in any process leading to self-
determination and therefore rejects any unilateral
declaration of independence. In that respect, my
country eagerly awaits the advisory opinion of the
International Court of Justice requested by the General
Assembly in its resolution 63/3 on whether the
unilateral declaration of independence of Kosovo is in
accordance with international law.
