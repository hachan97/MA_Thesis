The President: There are no further speakers
inscribed on my list for this portion of the meeting this
morning. The Security Council will continue the
consideration of this item on its agenda following the
adjournment of the open meeting, whereupon we will
enter into a private meeting. But before adjourning this
portion of the meeting, I would like to thank the
Secretary-General for his presence in having joined us
this morning.

The meeting rose at 11.35 am.
