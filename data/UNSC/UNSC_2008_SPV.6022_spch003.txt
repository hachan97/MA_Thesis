The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Mr. Pascoe for his briefing, which, as always, was very
comprehensive and balanced.

In accordance with the understanding reached in
the Council's prior consultations, I now invite Council
members to informal consultations to continue our
discussion of the subject.

The meeting rose at 10.40 am.
