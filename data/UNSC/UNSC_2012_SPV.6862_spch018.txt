The President: Allow me to appeal to the
remaining speakers, of whom there are eight on my
list. Given the time that we have available, which is less
than 30 minutes, I would request them to follow the
same procedure that the members of the Council used,
which was to have their statements in their entirety
distributed so that members can see them, and confine
their statements to a part thereof. That way, we will be
able to complete our work within the stipulated time.
I must also point out that we have some other urgent,
pressing business thereafter.

I give the floor to Mr. Vrailas.
