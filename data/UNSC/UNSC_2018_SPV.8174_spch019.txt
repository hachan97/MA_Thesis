Mr. Allen (United Kingdom): I disagree with a
lot of what my Russian colleague said, but I will not
stretch my colleagues' patience. But I do feel compelled
briefly to respond to several of the points that he made.

The first point is to say that this is not political
for us. Preventing the use of these abhorrent weapons
should transcend political disagreements. We do not
oppose Russia's important role in Syria at all. We noted
the outcomes of Sochi, and we look forward to the
proposal for a constitutional committee returning to the
next round of Geneva talks, with the full participation
of Russia and the Syrian authorities, as was laid out in
resolution 2254 (2015).

The second point I would simply make is that
the notion that it was anyone other than Russia that
ended the Joint Investigative Mechanism is absurd.
The voting records of the Council are clear and are
available to all. Russia vetoed three different proposals
for the extension of the Mechanism, the last of which
simply extended it for a short period and requested the
Secretary-General to make recommendations, but even
that was unacceptable.

Finally, on a note of agreement, Ijust want, like
my Dutch colleague, to praise the incredible work of
the White Helmets, who risk their own lives on a daily
basis to save thousands of Syrians civilians.
