Mr. Wang Xuexian (China) (interpretation from Chinese): The Chinese delegation welcomes the
representative of Tajikistan to the Security Council
Chamber today. I listened to his statement attentively; it
should be a positive element in the Council's
deliberations on Tajikistan.

 

The Tajik parties recently agreed on a further three-
month extension of the cease-fire agreement in order to
create a climate conducive to the prompt resumption of
political negotiations. We note that the two parties
concerned are making preparations for the next round of
political negotiations; the Chinese delegation welcomes this.

We reiterate that the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of the Republic of Tajikistan should be respected.
The basic approach to settling the question of Tajikistan is
for the parties concerned to resolve their differences
through peaceful negotiations and to achieve national
reconciliation. As a neighbour of Tajikistan, we sincerely
hope that Tajikistan will achieve peace, stability and the
well-being of its people.

We support the efforts of the Secretary-General and
his Special Representatives to promote a comprehensive
political settlement of the Tajik question. In carrying out its
mission, the United Nations Mission of Observers in
Tajikistan (UNMOT) has played and will continue to play
a positive role. We hope that the two parties concerned will
cooperate closely with UNMOT and ensure the security of
its personnel so that it can carry out its tasks undisturbed.

In his report to the Security Council, the Secretary-
General recommends that in the present circumstances
UNMOT should be maintained. We endorse that
recommendation and will vote in favour of the draft
resolution before us.

It is human nature to enjoy listening to pleasant words,
and Ambassador Qin Huasun is no exception to this. Hence,
I shall certainly convey to Ambassador Qin all the kind and
pleasant words addressed to him today.
