The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them the
report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
operation in Cyprus, document S/2006/315.

Members also have before them document
S/2006/393, which contains the text of a draft
resolution submitted by China, France, the Russian
Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and the United States of America.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.

I should like to inform the Council that, in my
capacity as President of the Council, I met with the
representatives of the parties, who have confirmed to
me that they maintain their well-known positions vis-a-
vis the item on the Council's agenda. On the basis of
those meetings, as President, with the consent of
members of the Council, I have drawn the conclusion
that the Council can proceed to take a decision on the
draft resolution before it.

Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft
resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by Show of hands.

In favour:
Argentina, China, Congo, Denmark, France,
Ghana, Greece, Japan, Peru, Qatar, Russian
Federation, Slovakia, United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of
Tanzania, United States of America

The President: There were 15 votes in favour.
The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 1687 (2006).
I shall now give the floor to those members of the
Council who wish to make statements following the
voting.
