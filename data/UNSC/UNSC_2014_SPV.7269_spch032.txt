The President: I would now like to make a further
statement in my national capacity.

I have only one response to the representative from
the Russian Federation. Russia is fighting in Ukraine.
Russia has provided artillery and surface-to-air missiles
to separatists in Ukraine. It has trained separatists on
those surface-to-air missiles. It has moved troops into
Ukraine. Russia has no standing to offer advice on
this investigation, and it has no credibility before the
Council in its professions, as its story has shifted for
months.

I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

The representative of the Russian Federation has
asked for the floor to make a further statement.
