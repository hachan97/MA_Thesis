The President (spoke in French): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Danilo Tiirk, Assistant Secretary-
General for Political Affairs.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Tiirk to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Danilo Turk, Assistant Secretary-
General for Political Affairs. I now give him the floor.
