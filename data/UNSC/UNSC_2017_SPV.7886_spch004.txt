Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
is deeply shocked at and regrets the untimely passing
of Ambassador Churkin following a brief illness. We
express our deep sorrow at his passing and offer our
heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family and the
Government and the Permanent Mission of the Russian
Federation.

As the Permanent Representative of the Russian
Federation for over 10 years, Ambassador Churkin
was an able, experienced and senior diplomat. He
made enormous contributions to the United Nations
and multilateralism. He worked right up to the last
minute of his life as an exemplar of dedication
and professionalism, and was thus an outstanding
representative of diplomats. We are deeply saddened
by his passing, which is a loss for the entire United
Nations diplomatic corps. Ambassador Churkin was a
good friend to many of us present here. He was sincere
and kind. Although we mourn his passing, his memory
will remain with us forever. He will be deeply missed.
May he rest in peace.

China joins with the Russian Federation and other
Council members in playing an active role in upholding
multilateralism and the principles and purposes of the
Charter of the United Nations, the maintenance of world
peace and the promotion of common development.
