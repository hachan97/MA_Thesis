The President: This completes the speeches by
members of the Security Council. We will hear the
remaining speakers after a suspension of three minutes.

I would like to point out that at the current rate of
speaking, we have over three hours left to go. If each
speaker would kindly try to cut his or her remarks to four
or five minutes - which I think is quite possible in most
cases, although those countries that are the subject of the
debate may legitimately wish to take a few extra
moments - it would be greatly appreciated.

The meeting was suspended at 3.55 pm. and resumed
at 4 p.m.

The President: In accordance with the understanding
reached in the Council's prior consultations, and in the
absence of objection, I shall take it that the Security
Council agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Dr. David Satcher,
Assistant Secretary for Health and Surgeon-General of the
United States.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Dr. Satcher to take his seat at the Council
table.


The President: The next speaker is the representative
of Algeria. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table
and to make his statement.
