Mr. Ladsous (France) (interpretation from French):
The 26 June 1995 assassination attempt against President
Mubarak reminded us that the terrorist threat remains ever
present.
France condemned the attempt at the time, with all the
vigour demanded by that abominable act. Today it renews
that condemnation.

With a wisdom that we salute, the Ethiopian
authorities put the question before the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), requesting that regional organization
to contribute to shedding light on the attempt and to assist
in seeing that justice is done.

France welcomes the efforts made by the OAU's
Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and
Resolution, which has made precise demands. It is those
demands that the Security Council, by the resolution it has
just adopted, rightly intends to support as firmly as
possible.

We therefore await full implementation of this
resolution by all of those to whom it is addressed.
