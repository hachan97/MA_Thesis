Baroness Ashton: Thank you, Mr. President. Iwill
be very brief.

Ijust want to say again what a privilege it is to be
here at the Security Council and to have had not only
an opportunity to describe some of the pressing issues
and how the European Union is responding to them,
but also the pleasure of listening to members of the
Council, both in a complimentary manner, for which I
thank them, and in our common cause of trying to find
the right solutions.

I end by simply repeating what I said in my
remarks - that we will remain a steadfast partner of
the United Nations. We will continue to work with
the United Nations, as well as other organizations, in
the pursuit of conflict prevention and resolution for a
peaceful and more secure world.
