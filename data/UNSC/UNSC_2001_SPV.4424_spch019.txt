The President: I thank Mr. Oshima for the
clarifications that he has provided and the questions
that he has answered with regard to the topic on our
agenda today.

I want to thank Mr. Oshima, on behalf of the
members of the Council. It is very important that this
matter be kept fully under review. The interest
generated in our discussion among members of the
Council, as well as in our debate yesterday, clearly
indicate that members of the Council, as well as non-
members, see a direct link between the protection of
civilians and issues relating to international peace and
security. Members drew attention to the importance of
developing a checklist which can be utilized with
regard to specific conflict situations. In this regard, we
look forward to the early interim report which Mr.
Oshima indicated might be available. Clearly, these
discussions on thematic issues are not an end in
themselves, but are intended to assist the Security
Council, the Secretariat and the other organs of the
United Nations system in ensuring a better life and
protection for the civilians who are the main victims of
armed conflict.

Again, I thank Mr. Oshima very much for the
clarifications. I am pleased that so many non-members
of the Council were present to hear the discussions on
this issue.
There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 12.10p.m.
