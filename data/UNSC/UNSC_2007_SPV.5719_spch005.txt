The President (spoke in Chinese): I thank the
representative of Lebanon for his statement.

There are no other speakers on my list. In
accordance with the understanding reached in the
Council's prior consultations, I would now like to
invite Council members to informal consultations on
the subject.

The meeting rose at 10.35 am.
