Mr. Dahlgren (Sweden): The mandate of the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) was given by
the Security Council in order to ensure that Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction are eliminated so as to
safeguard peace and security. Iraq must cooperate fully
with the Special Commission. The Security Council has
determined that Iraq must allow the Special Commission
immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access in Iraq.

Iraq has flagrantly and repeatedly violated its
obligations under relevant resolutions. Such violations are
unacceptable and warrant a firm response from the
Security Council. The draft resolution before us is a firm
and adequate response. The measures will target only
those individuals preventing UNSCOM. from having
access to sites it wishes to inspect or from conducting
interviews in order to fulfil its task. Innocent Iraqi
civilians will not be affected.

 

Full cooperation with the Special Commission and
implementation of the relevant resolutions is the only way
forward in order for the sanctions to be lifted. The
Government of Iraq carries a heavy responsibility towards
its own population if it continues to defy and further delay
the completion of the mandate of the Special Commission.

Sweden supports the draft resolution before us. Its
adoption by the Security Council will send a message
which should be clearly understood by the Government of
Iraq.
