Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We listened carefully to what the Permanent
Representative of Sweden has just said. To be candid,
we are somewhat puzzled by his statement, because the
draft resolution that we submitted (S/2018/322) is, in
essence, based on the same idea as the draft submitted
yesterday by the Swedish delegation. I do not know what
we are going to consult on in consultations. I believe we
already consulted on this subject yesterday. However,
out of respect for the Swedish delegation and those
delegations who would like to hold consultations, we
are not against that. But let me say right away that we
intend to put this draft resolution to a vote today, after
our consultations. We hope that the consultations will

be constructive and will not drag on for long, because
that is certainly not necessary at this point. We need
to adopt this draft resolution in support of the mission
of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons in order to establish the facts on the ground as
quickly as possible.
