Mr. Fesko (Ukraine): I apologize. We have just
witnessed a classic case of switching the blame and
obfuscating the situation. I have never mentioned
or blamed anybody, including any citizens, living
in the eastern part of our country. If I am mistaken,
I would really appreciate being corrected. I was
talking first about Russian military aggression,
and secondly, about terrorism. That is what we
experienced - State-sponsored terrorism. We may
have different opinions regarding this, but this is how
Ukraine sees it.

The meeting rose at 12.15 pm.
