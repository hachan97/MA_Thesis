Mr. Laro (Nigeria): I thank Under-Secretary-
General Feltman for his briefing. Nigeria is deeply
concerned that despite the various efforts aimed
at resolving the crisis in Ukraine, the situation on
the ground has not changed. The fighting between
Government forces and separatist rebels continues
unabated and has indeed intensified.

In our pronouncements on the crisis in Ukraine,
we have consistently called for a political solution that
adequately addresses the concerns of the separatists
while preserving and fully respecting the sovereignty,
territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine. That
remains our position. We urge the parties to work in
good faith towards overcoming the current stalemate
in the implementation of the Minsk agreement, which
Nigeria sees as providing a credible and workable
framework for a peaceful resolution of the crisis.
