The President: I wish to remind all speakers to
limit their statements to no more than four minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements
are kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing
and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in
the Chamber. I also wish to inform all concerned that
we will be carrying this open debate right through the
lunch hour as we have a very large number of speakers.

I now give the floor to the representative of India.
