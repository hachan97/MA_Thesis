Mr. Harrison (United Kingdom): My delegation
is very pleased to have voted in favour of this
resolution and, through you, Mr. President, we would
like to thank the representatives of Mauritius and
Jamaica, who put it forward as the original co-
sponsors.
Through you, Sir, we would also like to
congratulate the Government of South Africa on taking
the initiative on the protection force and on their
commitment to it. My Government is very ready to
consider financial support for this initiative.

While the United Kingdom fully supports the
South African initiative, we would like to make clear
that the Council is not endorsing the protection force
itself or giving it a United Nations mandate. We hope
that the parties will continue to work for a ceasefire,
but we should make it clear that, in that event, there
can be no automaticity about wider regional or
international participation. The Council will have to
consider such possibilities separately and on their
merits.
