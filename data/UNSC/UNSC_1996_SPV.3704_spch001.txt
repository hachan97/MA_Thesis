The President (interpretation from Spanish): The
Security Council will now begin its consideration of the
item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in
accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.

Members of the Council have before them documents
S/ 1996/774, S/1996/824 and S/1996/847, which contain the
text of the letters dated 23 September and 3 and 11 October
1996, respectively, from the Permanent Representative of
the Republic of Korea to the United Nations addressed to
the President of the Security Council; and documents
S/ 1996/768 and S/1996/800, which contain the text of the
letters dated 23 and 27 September 1996 from the Permanent
Representative of the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea to the United Nations addressed to the President of
the Security Council and the Secretary-General,
respectively.

 

Following consultations among members of the
Security Council, I have been authorized to make the
following statement on behalf of the Council:

"The Security Council has considered the
letters of the Permanent Representative of the
Republic of Korea (8/1996/774, S/l996/824 and 5/1996/847) and the letters of the Permanent
Representative of the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (S/l996/768 and S/1996/800), regarding
the incident of a submarine of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea on 18 September 1996.

"The Security Council expresses its serious
concern over this incident. The Council urges that
the Korean Armistice Agreement should be fully
observed and that no action should be taken that
might increase tension or undermine peace and
stability on the Korean peninsula.

"The Security Council stresses that the
Armistice Agreement shall remain in force until it is
replaced by a new peace mechanism.

"The Security Council encourages both sides of
the Korean peninsula to settle their outstanding
issues by peaceful means through dialogue, so that
peace and security on the peninsula will be
strengthened."

This statement will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/ 1996/42.

The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.

The meeting rose at 1.15 pm.
