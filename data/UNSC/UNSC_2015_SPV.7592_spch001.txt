The President: In accordance with rule 39 of
the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite
the following briefers to participate in this meeting:
Ms. Kyung-wha Kang, Assistant Secretary-General for
Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief
Coordinator, and Mr. Antonio Guterres, former United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

On behalf of the Security Council, I would like
to express our heartfelt gratitude to Mr. Guterres. He
presided over the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) during a very
difficult period and made heroic efforts on behalf of
people who often cannot speak for themselves but have
had in him a tremendous spokesperson. This is his last
briefing in that capacity to the Council. We will not
be sorry not to hear more bad news from him, but no
one has been more creative and agile in mobilizing
resources around the world to care for these people, and
we could not be more grateful for how much he has
put into his tenure at UNHCR, body and soul. We want
to wish him every success in the future and hope he
will stay involved in caring for the people who have
benefited so much from his leadership.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members to
document S/2015/962, which contains the report of the
Secretary-General on the implementation of Security
Council resolutions 2139 (2014), 2165 (2014) and 2191
(2014).

I now give the floor to Ms. Kang.
