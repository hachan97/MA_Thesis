Ms. Rasi: As has been stated by the two previous
speakers, there is a lot one could say, but at this late
stage I will only raise a few issues.

It was mentioned by many, if not all, speakers
that sustainable economic growth is indeed a key to
conflict prevention. This is an area where we need very
good cooperation among the United Nations family,
Governments, civil society, non-governmental
organizations and the private sector.

The question is how, in the years and months to
come, do we bring these multi-stakeholders together so
that we can really work together in promoting these
good ideas? When we, in this building, discuss conflict
prevention and peace-building, how can we then have
the other stakeholders sit together with us around the
same table? This is something we should discuss, as we
should also discuss how we can, within the United
Nations system, have closer cooperation in these fields.

On my behalf, I would like to thank you,
Mr. President, for this very important and valuable
initiative, and I do hope that we will continue this
important debate.
