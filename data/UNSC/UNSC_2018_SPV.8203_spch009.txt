Mr. Skoog (Sweden): I thank the delegation of the
United Kingdom for updating the Security Council on
the use of nerve agents in Salisbury on 4 March.

Sweden condemns in the strongest terms the use
of a nerve agent in an attempted murder on British
soil. We stress the seriousness of that incident, which
is unprecedented in Europe in recent years. Those
responsible for the attack must be identified and held
to account for their heinous actions. Given that a nerve
agent developed as a chemical weapon has been used
and the possibility that the attempted murder has links
to State actors, Sweden supports the decision of the
United Kingdom to bring the issue to the attention of
the Security Council and other relevant bodies, such
as the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons. We stand by the United Kingdom and, like
other European Union partners, express our strong
solidarity with the Government of the United Kingdom
and support its efforts in dealing with this grave
security issue.

We note that, in her letter to the Secretary-General
(S/2018/218, annex), the Prime Minister of the United
Kingdom states that the class of chemical warfare agents
used was originally developed by the Soviet Union and

inherited by the Russian Federation. Given that fact and
taking into account the principal Victim's background,
we support the request of the United Kingdom that
Russia provide an account of how the agent could have
come to be used in Salisbury.

Let me also take this opportunity to stress the
importance that Sweden attaches to the ban on
chemical weapons. Such barbaric and illegal weapons
kill indiscriminately and have no place in the world. We
must ensure that the integrity of the Chemical Weapons
Convention is fully respected.
