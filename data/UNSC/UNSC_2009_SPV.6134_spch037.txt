The President: I thank the Prosecutor of the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda for his
clarifications.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

May I take this opportunity, on behalf of the
Security Council, to thank Judge Robinson, Judge
Byron, Prosecutor Brammertz and Prosecutor Jallow
for taking the time to brief the Security Council.

The meeting rose at 1.15 pm.
