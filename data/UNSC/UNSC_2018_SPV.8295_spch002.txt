Mr. Tenya (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I would like
to take this opportunity to recall that international
criminal law is vital to enabling access to justice,
fighting impunity for atrocity crimes, deterring
potential perpetrators and ultimately safeguarding
human rights and promoting sustainable peace and the
maintenance of international peace and security.

I want to stress the importance of maintaining
the unity of the Security Council in its support for
the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal
Tribunals, which is mandated to fight impunity and
contribute to reconciliation in countries where atrocity
crimes have been committed. Compliance with that
mandate depends to a great extent on States' living up to
their responsibility to cooperate with the enforcement
of sentences, implement warrants and respond to
requests for assistance by the Residual Mechanism.
In that regard, the Council can and must play its role
as guarantor.

As Chair of the Working Group on International
Tribunals, Peru would like to thank all the delegations
that assisted and participated constructively during
the consultations leading to the adoption of resolution
2422 (2018), which reflects the conclusions of the
second review of the work of the International Residual
Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, renews its mandate
and appoints its Prosecutor. We are also grateful for the
steadfast support that we have received from the Office
of Legal Affairs and the secretariat of the Security
Council, and offer our support and best wishes to the
high officials appointed to the Residual Mechanism as
they discharge their weighty responsibilities.
