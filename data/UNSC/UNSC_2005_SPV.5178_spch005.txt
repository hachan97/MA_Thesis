Mr. Holliday (United States of America): I thank
Ambassador Sardenberg for his leadership of the
Security Council mission and his informative
presentation. We, too, would like to salute the efforts
of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti
and the personnel that the United Nations has on the
ground in Haiti for their hard work and dedication.

My colleague, Ambassador Patterson, represented
the United States on the mission, and when she came
back she mentioned that one of the things that
particularly struck her was the lack of a functioning
judiciary. She noted that, without a proper judiciary
and penal system, the reform of the Haitian National
Police will never achieve real success. Haitian
interlocutors informed mission representatives that the
backlog of cases is such that most of those imprisoned
and awaiting trial in Haiti have already been
incarcerated for longer periods of time than if they had
been tried and found guilty.

We find this situation unacceptable. While there
have been and are some efforts under way to help build
the Haitian judicial system, we believe that they are
insufficient. We have asked the United Nations
Department of Peacekeeping Operations to discuss
with judicial reform experts, and in particular with
several experienced international judges who will soon
depart East Timor, the possibility of undertaking an
assessment of Haiti's judicial system. We hope that
other members agree that the Haitian judiciary is a
problem that must be solved, in conjunction with
police reform, and that an assessment would be a good
first step.
