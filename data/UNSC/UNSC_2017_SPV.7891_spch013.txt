Mr. Sadykov (Kazakhstan): We thank Special
Representative Zahir Tanin for his detailed briefing
and his efforts and commitment to bringing peace
to Kosovo.

The situation in Kosovo needs the continuing
attention of the Council as an ongoing item on its agenda.
Our priorities should be to continue promoting dialogue
between the parties by launching confidence-building
measures in the political, military, economic,
environmental and human dimensions. That should be
in compliance with resolution 1244 (1999) and with the
efforts of the European Union, the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe and other relevant
organizations, which must act as security providers at
the global, regional and national levels.

Moreover, while the peaceful dialogue between
Pristina and Belgrade is ongoing, a number of difficult
issues remain to be solved. Action must therefore be
taken to integrate the judiciary, build transitional
justice, transfer the functions and assets to local
authorities and lay the foundations of good governance
and the rule of law. Social stability will be achieved
only with the full engagement of the United Nations
country team, regional organizations and civil society
groups working towards peacebuilding and conflict
prevention and mediation in Kosovo.

Upholding human rights is critical, with a special
focus onimplementing resolution 1325 (2000), on women
and peace and security, and subsequent resolutions on
enhancing gender equality and empowerment.

We also believe that the rich cultural heritage of
Kosovo should be preserved as a bridge-builder for
community relations and good-neighbourly relations.
