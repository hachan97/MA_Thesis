Mr. Sadeghi (Islamic Republic of Iran): My first
statement was not, in fact, a response to the first
statement of the representative of Israel, as that
representative said, but this one is indeed a response to
what the representative of Israel just said.

1 shall be very brief and will limit my response to
one sentence. What the representative of Israel just
said was a big lie. and it shows that all the other things
they say are the same. the proof being that the

secretariat of the Security Council received our letter,
requesting that our delegation be included in the list of
speakers, on Friday.
