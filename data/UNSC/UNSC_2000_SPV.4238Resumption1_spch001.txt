The President: Before I give the floor to the next
speaker, I would like to say that I would not mind our
having a more interactive debate. Members may wish
to come back to something that someone else has said.
There will be a second round, but if members feel that
it would be useful to intervene earlier, and tell me so, I
will give them the floor.
