Mr. Negroponte (United States of America): I
would first like to thank Assistant Secretary-General
Tiirk for this timely briefing on the status of the
political process and the work of the United Nations
Political Office in Bougainville (UNPOB). We also
appreciate the opportunity to hear the views of
neighbouring States which have been uniquely
involved in the stabilization of Bougainville. We
support the recommendation that there should be a
follow-on interim observer mission that will facilitate
completion of the constitutional process and complete
the destruction of weapons.

The United Nations political mission in
Bougainville has been successful. An interim observer
mission will provide the necessary transition that will
foster increased security and further economic
development. We appreciate the effort of regional
players in assisting in the process of stabilization and
thank Special Representative of the Secretary-General
Noel Sinclair for his efforts to facilitate the
constitutional process. We look forward to the results
of this week's Peace Process Consultative Committee
meeting and we hope that all parties can work to find
resolution of their different positions.
