The President: I shall now make a statement in
my national capacity.

As the representative of the Netherlands, Ijoin all
previous speakers in their praise of Mrs. Ogata. It is
also in that connection that I wish to thank those
speakers, including Mrs. Ogata herself, who spoke kind
words about Ruud Lubbers, the High Commissioner-
elect.

Mrs. Ogata has spoken in her briefing of the
continually widening gap in time between the
beginning of humanitarian activities and that of peace
operations. She reminded us how, as a result, there
were places in the world where unarmed humanitarian
workers were on their own in dangerous and isolated
duty stations.

The problem of the security of humanitarian
workers, however, cannot be solved solely through the
establishment of peace operations, no matter how
successful we may be in streamlining that part of our
work through the Brahimi exercise.

My delegation is of the view that all governments
have a responsibility to provide a safe environment for
humanitarian workers. That should be the first focus.
Where effective authority is lacking, the international
community has a duty to contribute to adequate
security arrangements. That should be the second
focus. In this regard I call on all Member States to
follow our example and contribute to the Trust Fund
for Security of United Nations personnel.

Owing to a lack of alternatives UNHCR has been
forced to too often to continue its activities in the grey
zone between humanitarian relief and structural
assistance. Bridging that gap requires coordinated exit/
entry strategies on the part of aid organizations, but
also more flexible implementation of procedures and
processes on the donor side. Our ultimate aim should
be a fully integrated approach to conflict prevention,
conflict resolution and post-conflict peace-building.

I now resume my function as President of the
Council and I shall call on Mrs. Ogata to respond to the
various comments and questions.
