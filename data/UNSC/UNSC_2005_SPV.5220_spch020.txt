The President (spoke in French): I should like to
thank Mr. Morris for the additional information he has
given us and for the answers that he has provided to the
members of the Council.

There are no further speakers on my list. The
Security Council has thus concluded the present stage
of its consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 12.40 p.m.
