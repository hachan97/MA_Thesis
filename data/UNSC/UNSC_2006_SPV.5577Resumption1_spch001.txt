The President (spoke in Arabic): As I indicated
at the morning session, I wish to remind all speakers to
limit their statements to no more than five minutes in
order to enable the Council carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate their texts in writing and
to deliver condensed versions of their speeches when
speaking in the Chamber.
