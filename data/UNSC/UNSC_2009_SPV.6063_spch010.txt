Mr. Babacan (Turkey): After three days of
negotiations, we finally managed to reach agreement
on the resolution just adopted. We may not be fully
satisfied with the text before us, but, after all, it is a
compromise representing the will of the Security
Council. Therefore, I thank everyone who made this
possible.

The crucial task for the Security Council at this
stage was to make a strong appeal to stop the
bloodshed and halt all military activities. The
resolution we have just adopted achieves this, with its
clear call for an immediate ceasefire and a full
withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. The
unequivocal call for unimpeded access for
humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza and the
emphasis on the sustained and regular flow of goods
and people to Gaza are equally important and strong
messages of this resolution. This is in fact a call for the
lifting of the blockade in all aspects.

Now, of course, we have to focus on the
immediate implementation of the terms of this
resolution, without any delay. Full and effective
implementation of this resolution is a must in order to
put an end to this tragedy and to the suffering of the
people of Gaza. Right after the ceasefire, it will be
vital to concentrate our efforts on the national
reconciliation of Palestinians.

For its part, Turkey will exert every effort for the
implementation of all aspects of this resolution. We
will continue to work with our friends and partners in
the region and beyond to secure lasting calm and
stability in the region.

Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to
reiterate the need to have a viable and comprehensive
peace on all tracks of the Middle East peace process.
Turkey will lend its full support to all endeavours in
that direction.
