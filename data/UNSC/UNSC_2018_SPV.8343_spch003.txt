Mr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish):
We appreciate the convening of this meeting and the
information that the representative of the United
Kingdom shared with us on the investigations conducted
and evidence found, of which we take careful note.

We would like to reiterate our deep concern about
the use of a nerve agent in public spaces in the United
Kingdom, which claimed the life of an innocent woman
and seriously endangered the lives of at least four other
people. We express our condolences and solidarity with
the victims and with the people of the United Kingdom
that were potentially exposed to the chemical agent
in question.

Peru resolutely condemns all use of chemical
weapons. We consider that such a practice constitutes in
and of itself constitutes a threat to international peace
and security, an atrocity crime and a flagrant violation
of the respective non-proliferation regime.
We therefore reiterate our call on the parties
concerned to cooperate fully with the investigations
and anything else related to this delicate matter,
especially through the Organization for the Prohibition
of Chemical Weapons and other competent bodies,
in line with the principle of the peaceful settlement
of disputes. We stress the urgent need to determine
responsibility and the corresponding sanctions, within
the framework of the rule of law and due process.
