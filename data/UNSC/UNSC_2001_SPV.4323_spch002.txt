Mr. Mahbubani (Singapore): I apologize for
interrupting the proceedings, Sir, but you referred in
your introduction to the point that we are meeting here
on the basis of prior consultations.

We were present at the consultations yesterday. I
just want to reconfirm that the proceedings this
morning will proceed on the basis of prior
consultations, which established that we will first hear
a representation by the leader of the mission,
Ambassador Jean-David Levitte, and that we will then
hear the representatives of the countries that we visited
and spoke to involving this issue. My understanding is
that this will be followed by the participation of the
members of the Council, who will signal their interest
in speaking and will be recognized in the order in
which their requests to be heard are made, and that
there will be no speakers' list, as we agreed yesterday.

I just want to reconfirm the understanding that we
reached in the informal consultations yesterday.
