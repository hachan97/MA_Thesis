The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Belgium, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In accordance with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in conformity with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. de Ruyt
(Belgium) took the seat reserved for him at the
Side ofthe Council Chamber.

The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
document 8/2001/1058, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations.

I invite the representative of Belgium to take a
seat at the Council table and to make his statement.
