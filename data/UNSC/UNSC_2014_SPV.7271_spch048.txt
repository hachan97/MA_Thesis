The President: I thank Minister Al-Khalifa for
the important list of commitments that Bahrain is
prepared to make. We all look forward to taking part
in the conference, which will be a very important part
of success.

I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Khalid
Bin Mohamed Al-Attiyah, Minister for Foreign Affairs
of Qatar, whom I thank for the early and defined
commitments that his country has already made to our
effort.
