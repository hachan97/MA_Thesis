Mr. Sardenberg (Brazil): Brazil is gravely
concerned at the escalation of violence now taking
place in the Middle East. During the last 30 days, more
than 100 people have been killed, while many others
have been wounded.

Brazil condemns the killing of the Hamas
spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and six other
Palestinians. We deplore all recent acts of violence,
carried out in an attack-and-reprisal basis, opposing
Israelis and Palestinians. All sides should exercise
maximum restraint at this moment and resume as soon
as possible negotiations based on the road map
endorsed by Security Council resolution 1515 (2003).
This regrettable escalation of violence cannot continue
to jeopardize the process of peace in the region.

We believe that it is incumbent upon the Security
Council to state its position regarding such an act that
increases the risk of destabilizing the Middle East
region.
