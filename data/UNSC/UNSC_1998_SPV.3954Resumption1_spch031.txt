The President (interpretation from Arabic): I thank
the representative of Ukraine for the kind words he
addressed to me and to my predecessor, Ambassador
Burleigh.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
representative of Australia. I invite him to take a seat at
the Council table and to make his statement.
