Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I am sorry,
but I cannot let some of the preceding statements
go unchallenged.

The United Kingdom and its partners do not
support terrorism. We fight terrorism wherever we see
it. The Syrian representative's last remarks were quite
unjustified and wholly without foundation and I invite
him to withdraw them. We do not support terrorists. It
is that simple.

On the other issues concerning the deadline, it is in

Syria's hands. When there is a viable political process in
Syria, the rehabilitation of Syria and its reconstruction,
financed by Western money, can start. But until there
is a viable political process brokered by the United
Nations, we will not be able to start the reconstruction.
We have made that abundantly clear in the Council. The
way forward lies in Syria's hands, and nothing that we
have said today about the detainee issue contravenes
the sovereignty, territorial integrity or unity of Syria.
People in Syria simply want to know where their family
members are.

I note that he has not answered the question. We
would like him to go and transmit to his authorities
requests from the Council to provide information about
the detainees and to allow the International Committee
of the Red Cross (ICRC) access to them. That is a very
simple request. It does not trample upon sovereignty.
Other people allow the ICRC access to their detention
facilities in their countries. We are simply asking for
the same.
