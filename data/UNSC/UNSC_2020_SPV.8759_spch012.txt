Mr. Ladeb (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): We welcome the unanimous adoption of resolution 2543 (2020). We thank Indonesia and Germany, as well as Qatar for facilitating the peace process. We hope that this is the beginning of a phase of stability and prosperity for Afghanistan. We also hope that the role of women and the protection of children will be enhanced, and that these will lead to our desired goals.
