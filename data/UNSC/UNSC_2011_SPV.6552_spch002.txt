Mr. Assaf (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): Lebanon
reaffirms that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons is based on balance between the
three pillars of disarmament, non-proliferation and the
right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. For
Lebanon and all Arab countries, that balance is the
principal avenue for meeting the aspirations of their
peoples to a world free of nuclear weapons. As we seek
to create such a world, we await the day when the
peoples of the Middle East will be able to live in a
region free of nuclear weapons similar to other such
regions around the world.

Despite our awareness that the resolution we have
just adopted is purely technical in nature and that many
2

delegations have striven to keep it so, and because
Lebanon abstained in the voting on resolution 1929
(2010) - whereby, pursuant to its paragraph 29, the
Panel of Experts was established - Lebanon, in line
with its consistent position, abstained again today in
the voting.
