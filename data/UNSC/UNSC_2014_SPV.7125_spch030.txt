Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): I do not
want to prolong today's debate but I must take issue with
some of the things that the Russian ambassador has said.

Let us be clear about the facts of what has happened
in Crimea. The Russian forces have forcibly taken over
military and civilian airports and infrastructure. They
have set up roadblocks and pressured Ukrainian military
leaders to defect. They have given other Ukrainian units

ultimatums to surrender. They have blocked Ukrainian
ports and vastly increased their military forces all along
the Russian-Ukrainian border.

There is no justification for that military action in
international law or in the Agreement between Ukraine
and the Russian Federation on the Status and Conditions
of Presence of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian
Federation in the Territory of Ukraine, as article 6 of that
Agreement sets forth very clearly: "Military formations
shall respect the sovereignty of Ukraine, shall abide by
Ukrainian laws and shall not interfere in the internal
affairs of Ukraine." What part of that Agreement justifies
the military action that we have seen Russian taking in
Crimea?

My Russian colleague has said just now that
the Russian Federation is not against the idea of an
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
monitoring mission to eastern Ukraine and Crimea. Can
he now confirm therefore that the Russian Federation
accepts the deployment of such a mission in the next few
days?
