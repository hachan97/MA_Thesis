Mr. Zhao Yong (China) (spoke in Chinese): China
welcomes the adoption of resolution 2259 (2015). The
Libyan political dialogue process under United Nations
auspices has made important progress in recent days.
China welcomes the signing by various Libyan parties of
the Libyan Political Agreement and the announcement
of the expeditious establishment of a Government of
National Accord. That is a reflection of the ardent hope
of the Libyan people and various parties in Libya for
the stabilization of the domestic political situation and
for prompt realization of peace and stability.

China has always advocated for a political
settlement of the Libyan conflict and actively supports
and participates in the Libyan political dialogue, while
supporting the mediation efforts of the international
community, in particular that of the United Nations.
We hope that the parties to the Libyan conflict will
effectively implement the Political Agreement,
advance the inclusive political process, establish the
Government of National Accord, achieve comprehensive
reconciliation and restore national stability at an early
date. China is ready to join all parties concerned in
continued efforts to achieve peace and stability in
Libya and in the region.
