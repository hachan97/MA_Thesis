Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation is committed to the
implementation of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban
Treaty (CTBT), which, as is well-known, our country
ratified as early as 2001. We hope that resolution 2310
(2016), adopted today, will help a maximum number of
States, especially those listed in annex 2 to the CTBT,
sign and ratify the Treaty.

We believe that the moratoriums on nuclear testing,
as important as they are, cannot serve as a full-fledged
replacement for legally binding international norms.
The Treaty, rather than national moratoriums, should
be the benchmark for States' responsible behaviour.
Unfortunately, the pen that signed the Treaty, President
Bill Clinton's - which Secretary of State Kerry
mentioned this morning - was not that of President
Barack Obama, and the United States has found itself
unable to ratify the CTBT. We hope that the next
President of the United States will be more zealous in
his desire to see the Treaty ratified.

We would not want the adoption of this resolution
to serve as an unwelcome precedent for the Security
Council's interference in the remit of other international
structures, or the creation of obligations under an
international treaty for those States that have not joined
that treaty. In this case, we feel we were able to avoid
such a risk. Today, the Council adopted a balanced
resolution that does not clash with the provisions of the
CTBT. It is for that reason that we voted in favour of it.

The fact that the delegation of Ukraine always seems
to step outside the parameters of our discussion at the
Security Council has become an unfortunate tradition,
and we do not intend to yield to such provocations.
