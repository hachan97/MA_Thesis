The President: In accordance with rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure, I invite the
representative of Libya to participate in this meeting.

In accordance with rule 39 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure, I invite Ms. Fatou
Bensouda, Prosecutor of the International Criminal
Court, to participate in this meeting.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

I would remind Council members that this meeting
will be followed by consultations on the same agenda
item. It would therefore be most helpful if we could
move expeditiously through both.

I give the floor to Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda.
