The President (spoke in Chinese): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Denmark, Japan, Ukraine and
Yugoslavia in which they request to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite those representatives to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. S'ahovie
(Yugoslavia), took a seat at the Council table;
Ms. Loj (Denmark), Mr. Motomura (Japan) and
Mr. Kuchinsky (Ukraine) took the seats reserved
for them at the side ofthe Council Chamber.

The President (spoke in Chinese): In accordance
with the understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall
take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an
invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure to Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno, Under-
Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations.

It is so decided.

I invite Mr. Guehenno to take a seat at the
Council table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
