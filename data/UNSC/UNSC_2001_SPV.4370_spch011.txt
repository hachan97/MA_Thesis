Mr. Lavrov (Russia) (spoke in Russian): The
United States has come up against an unprecedented
act of aggression of international terrorism. On behalf
of the Russian leadership, we would like to express our
most sincere and deepest condolences to all of the
victims and to the people and Government of the
United States of America.

Yesterday's events in the United States transcends
national borders. It is a brazen challenge to all of
humankind. What took place on 11 September once
again highlights the timeliness of the task of joining the
efforts of the entire international community in
combating terror, this plague of the twenty-first
century. This task was set forth in Security Council
resolution 1269 (1999), which was unanimously
adopted at the initiative of Russia.

Yesterday's statement by the Council and the
draft resolution we are adopting today demonstrate
unconditionally the resolve of Council members to do
all they can to leave not one terrorist act unpunished
and to increase efforts to prevent and end terrorism.

In a statement of 11 September, President
Vladimir Putin said:

"Russia knows very well what terror is and
so we understand better than most the feelings of
the American people. On behalf of Russia, I turn
to the people of the United States of America. I
would like to say that we are with you, we are in
full solidarity with your feelings of grief and we
support you."
