Mr. Michon (France) (spoke in French): France
welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution
2491 (2019), which extends for 12 months the legal
framework established by resolution 2240 (2015) and
reaffirms our collective determination to combat
tirelessly the smuggling of migrants and refugees off
the coast of Libya.

This collective undertaking, which is the
responsibility of us all, is part ofthe international legal
framework, in particular international conventions on
the law of the sea, on international organized crime and
on refugees. As stated in resolution 2240 (2015), the
rights, humanity and dignity of refugees and migrants
must be fully respected by all.
