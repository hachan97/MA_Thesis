Mr. Aldahhak (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): My delegation would like to reply to the claims
made by the representative of Saudi Arabia.

When we talk about the role of the Government
of Saudi Arabia in supporting terrorism, we do not
speak in a vacuum and level random accusations. Saudi
support for terrorism through money and weapons and
the extremist Takfiri interpretations that have nothing
to do with Islam are well known issues, underscored
by historical events in Afghanistan to Syria, Iraq and
Lebanon, as well as other countries, including the State
that hosts the Organization.

Who can think that caring for the Syrian people
means sending mercenaries and terrorists to Syria from
all over the world, with Saudi funds and weapons, to
run amok there and to try and impose their inhuman
thinking on Syrians? That is what has happened at
the hands of the Saudi Arabia Government and its
intelligence and cooperation with other countries so as
to settle their accounts with us and serve the agendas
of other States.

We call on the Government of Saudi Arabia to
review its policies and to put an end to its practice of
supporting terrorism to the detriment of the interests
of the sisterly Saudi people. The Government of Saudi
Arabia must realize that financing the United Nations
anti-terrorism centre will not deceive anyone. It will not
blind anyone to Saudi Arabia's support for terrorism.
