Mr. Tafrov (Bulgaria) (spoke in French): Given
the lateness of the hour, I shall try to be as brief as
possible.

First of all, my delegation would like to thank
you, Mr. President, for having organized this debate on
the problem of refugees, which is an important issue.
The briefing just delivered by the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees is extremely interesting
and useful to us.

I would simply like to speak a bit about the
situation in the western Balkans, to which Mr. Lubbers
quite rightly referred. We share his analysis. I would
just like to draw the attention of the Council and that of
Mr. Lubbers to the highly delicate situation that still
prevails in Macedonia. We agree with him that there is
a major risk of new problems triggering refugee flows.
We must not forget that this small country recently
experienced an unprecedented inflow of refugees, a
number that represents a very significant percentage of
its own population. To some extent, the presence of
those refugees during the Kosovo crisis has jeopardized
the very existence of Macedonia. We must never forget
that. I therefore thank Mr. Lubbers for having
addressed this very important problem that may
potentially become serious.

Mr. Lubbers was quite right to speak of a certain
donor fatigue with respect to the problem of refugees
in the western Balkans. True enough, there has been
some impressive success, but at the same time the
reintegration of refugees into their respective national
communities remains a major problem. That is where
we run into the very important issue that Mr. Lubbers
mentioned a moment ago: immediate humanitarian
efforts, and development efforts. We thank Mr. Lubbers
for taking that nuanced and accurate approach, and for
showing that refugees often constitute a development
opportunity both for the country of refuge and for the
country of origin. That is worth emphasizing.
