The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council
agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Jacques Klein,
Special Representative of the Secretary-General for
Liberia.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Klein to take a seat at the Council
table.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members have before them the report of the
Secretary-General to the Security Council on Liberia in
document S/2003/875.

At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a
briefing by Mr. Jacques Klein, Special Representative
of the Secretary-General for Liberia. I give him the
floor.
