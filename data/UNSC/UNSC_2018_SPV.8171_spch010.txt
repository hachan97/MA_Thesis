Mr. Ndong Mba (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in Spanish): In taking the floor at this meeting on the
humanitarian situation of Syrian Arab Republic, I
should like to begin by sincerely thanking Ms. Ursula
Mueller, Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian
Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator,
for her detailed briefing on the very unfortunate
humanitarian situation that Syria is currently
undergoing. Moreover, we listened to Under-Secretary-
General Lowcock's briefing on 22 January following
his visit to Syria, in which he pointed out for us five
areas where improvement is needed in order to address
the serious humanitarian situation, including the
imperative to address the needs of some 13 million
people in Syria, to facilitate medical evacuations and
freedom of movement across borders, and to adopt
measures so that the United Nations and international
non-governmental organizations can provide effective
assistance to the Syrian people.

Both Ms. Mueller and Mr. Lowcock's briefings
afford us a very desolate overview that must focus the
attention of the international community on making
every effort necessary to alleviate the suffering of the
Syrian people. The specific situation in eastern Ghouta,
in which almost 94 per cent of the people are trapped, is
a particularly a worrisome issue. The situation of more
than 600 people in need ofurgent medical care has been,
and is being, exacerbated by air-strike campaigns that
have led to the displacement of those in Idlib and Hama.

In addition to all this, we also point to the
catastrophic humanitarian situation resulting from the
ongoingOperation Olive Branch, which is leading to
the substantial displacement and suffering of civilians.
On the one hand, that can only elicit our deep concern,
and, on the other hand, we must call for redoubling
the efforts of the United Nations and the international
community to find a solution to the very serious
humanitarian crisis in the Syrian Arab Republic.
