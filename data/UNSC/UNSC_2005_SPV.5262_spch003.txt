The President: May I take it that the draft report
is adopted by the Council?

There being no objection, it is so decided.
This decision will be reflected in a note by the
President of the Security Council, to be issued as
document S/2005/582.

The Security Council has thus concluded its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

The meeting rose at 10.20 am.
