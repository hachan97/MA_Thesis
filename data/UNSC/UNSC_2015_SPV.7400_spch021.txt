Mr. Sarki (Nigeria): I to would like to thank

Mr. Feltman, Mr. Simonovic' and Mr. Ging for their
briefings this morning.

Nigeria notes that the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine
is holding, although the situation remains tenuous and
precarious. The Minsk agreements provide the basis for
a long-term resolution of the crisis in Ukraine. They
should therefore be respected and not be undermined
by acts that run counter to its provisions. The human
rights of all peoples must be respected. Humanitarian
assistance must reach all those in need without
discrimination.
Nigeria urges all sides in Ukraine to refrain from
acts that may threaten the ceasefire and erode the gains
made in de-escalating the conflict. The ceasefire is a
critical confidence-building measure, an important
first step towards the implementation of the political,
economic and governance aspects of the package
of measures for the implementation of the Minsk
agreements. In our view, the agreements represent a
comprehensive framework for a political solution that
will hopefully return Ukraine to a state of normalcy
and peace and ensure the respect for its sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity.
