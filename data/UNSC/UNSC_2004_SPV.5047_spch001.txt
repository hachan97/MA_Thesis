The President: As this is the first meeting of the
Security Council for the month of October, I should
like to take the opportunity to pay tribute, on behalf of
my colleagues in the Council, to His Excellency
Mr. Juan Antonio Yafiez-Barnuevo, Permanent
Representative of Spain to the United Nations, for his
service as President for the month of September 2004.
I am sure I speak for all members of the Council in
expressing deep appreciation to him for the skill with
which he conducted the Council's business last month
and the manner in which he did so.

Adoption of the agenda
The agenda was adopted.

The situation between Iraq and Kuwait

Letter dated 21 September 2004 from the

the Security Council (S/2004/764)

The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its the agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.

Members of the Council have before them
photocopies of document S/2004/764, which contains a
letter dated 21 September 2004 from the Secretary-
General - whose presence I welcome - concerning
security arrangements for the United Nations
Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI).

Members of the Council also have before them
the draft of a reply which I, as President of the Security
Council, propose to send to the Secretary-General,
informing him that the Council welcomes the proposed
arrangements set out in his letter and urges Member
States to respond positively with contributions.

In the absence of objection, I shall assume that
the Security Council agrees that I should send the reply
as drafted to the Secretary-General.

It is so decided.

The reply will be issued as a document of the
Council under the symbol S/2004/765.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
