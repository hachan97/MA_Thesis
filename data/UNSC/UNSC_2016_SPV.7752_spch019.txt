Mr. Power (United States of America): I thank
the representative of China for his response, which
is probably to my comments. I think that one of the
things that the Chinese Ambassador appealed for was
a cautious approach, and Ijust want to say that I think
that it is very safe to say, a year and a halfinto the crisis,
that the Council has succeeded in taking a cautious
approach. We have yet to do anything to materially
affect the trajectory of the conflict. We have a very
modest resolution before us today, resolution 2303
(2016), that luckily did go through but that we really
need to unite behind.

With our divisions, we are worse. We are worse at
preserving international peace and security. This is not
a resolution that the United States thought was a great
resolution, and I know abstentions can feel as if one
canjust stay on the sidelines and make one's principled
position clear, but we have to unite on Burundi. Those
same Burundian people that were just invoked are, I
think, counting on us to be able to unite on something
as modest as this.
