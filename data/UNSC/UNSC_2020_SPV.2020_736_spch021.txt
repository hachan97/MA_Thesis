Ihave the honour to speak on behalf of the 120 member States of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries (NAM). At the outset, I would like to congratulate the Permanent Mission of Germany for its successful presidency of the Security Council this month, and thank it for providing an opportunity for the Non-Aligned Movement to present its position on the question of Palestine, which has historically constituted an issue of concern and vital importance to the Movement. Having considered the critical developments and deteriorating situation in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, the Coordinating Bureau of the Non-Aligned Movement, in its communique on illegal Israeli annexation plans in the occupied Palestinian territory adopted on 15 May, condemned the plans announced by Israel, the occupying Power, to annex large parts of the occupied West Bank, including the Jordan Valley and the land on which it has established its settlements and the wall. Israel's ongoing settlement colonization of the Palestinian land, including East Jerusalem, and all measures of annexation constitute grave breaches of international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, the Fourth Geneva Convention and numerous relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. The Non-Aligned Movement cautions that, if not averted, such plans will have far- reaching and devastating repercussions on the prospects for realizing the rights of the Palestinian people, including to self-determination and independence, the two- State solution based on the pre-1967 borders and just and lasting peace and security. NAM calls on the international community to enact serious measures of accountability in the light of Israel's continued non-compliance. This should include the halting of business with the illegal Israeli settlements and the banning of entry to markets of settlement products, among other measures of accountability, in line with international norms and rules, including relevant United Nations resolutions and the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The Non-Aligned Movement continues to believe that resolution 2334 (2016) provides the most viable path to peace and calls for its full and effective implementation. This resolution sets forth the essential requirements and parameters for the achievement of the two-State solution based on the pre-1967 borders, in respect of the long-standing terms of reference of peace endorsed by the international community, in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions and the Madrid principles, including the principle of land for peace, the Arab Peace Initiative and the Quartet road map. NAM calls for the cessation of all violations, provocations and aggressions in this regard and for respect for the sanctity of holy sites, rejecting any attempts to alter the historical and legal status quo. NAM also expresses support for Jordan in preserving and administrating the Islamic and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem, including the Al-Aqsa Mosque/Haram Al-Sharif and the Hashemite historical custodianship of the holy sites as exercised by His Majesty King Highness Abdullah II ibn Al-Hussein of Jordan. NAM stresses that the Department of Jerusalem's Awgaf and Al-Aqsa Mosque Affairs of Jordan is the sole and exclusive authority to administer Al-Aqsa Mosque/Haram Al]-Sharif. The Non-Aligned Movement demands once again that Israel abide by resolution 497 (1981) and withdraw fully from the occupied Syrian Golan to the borders of 4 June 1967, in the implementation of resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). The members of the Non-Aligned Movement condemn the statement made by the President of the United States of America on 21 March 2019 regarding the occupied Syrian Golan, as well as the subsequent unilateral and arbitrary proclamation on recognizing the Golan Heights as part of Israel, and call upon the Security Council to shoulder its responsibility by clearly condemning this provocative statement and proclamation. We reiterate the call on the Security Council to uphold its duties, implement its resolutions vis-a-vis the question of Palestine and act urgently to address Israel's annexation plans, which threaten regional and international peace and security. The Non-Aligned Movement commends the efforts of His Majesty King Mohammed VI as Chair of Al-Quds Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation. NAM welcomes the call for Al-Quds/Jerusalem, signed in Rabat on 30 March 2019 by His Majesty King Mohammed VI of Morocco and His Holiness Pope Francis, to stress the important role that Al-Quds/Jerusalem plays as a city of tolerance and mutual respect among the people of the three monotheistic religions and stresses the need to preserve its specificities and its features as a city of peaceful coexistence. In the light of the continuously deteriorating humanitarian and socioeconomic situation of the Palestinian people, including the Palestine refugees, challenged even further by the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the members of the Movement express deep appreciation for the invaluable work done by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, including its essential emergency assistance provided to help Palestine refugees to confront the COVID-19 pandemic. We urge once again sufficient and predictable funding of the Agency to enable the continuity of its operations, in line with its General Assembly mandate, and encourage support for the Agency's core programme budget, as well as for the United Nations COVID-19 response plan for the occupied Palestinian territory and the COVID-19 flash appeal for Palestine Refugees. In conclusion, the Non-Aligned Movement reaffirms its abiding solidarity with the Palestinian people, as well as its unwavering support for their just cause, and renews its commitment to further supporting, strengthening and coordinating the international efforts to achieve a just, lasting, comprehensive and peaceful solution to the question of Palestine in all its aspects, including for the plight of the Palestine refugees based on resolution 194 (III). We express our sincere hopes that, this year, we will witness tangible progress in the heroic quest of the Palestinian people to attain justice and fulfil their inalienable rights and legitimate national aspirations, including their right to self-determination, freedom and independence in their sovereign and independent State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital. This will most certainly open a new chapter for regional as well as global peace and stability, a goal strongly supported by our Movement and one that requires urgent international action to avert the looming dangers and salvage the prospects for a just and lasting peace.
