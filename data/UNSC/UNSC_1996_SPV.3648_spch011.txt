The President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank
the representative of Botswana for his kind words
addressed to me.

We have come to the end of this morning's meeting.
There are a number of speakers remaining on my list. As
agreed in prior consultations, I shall now adjourn the
meeting. The Council will continue its consideration of
the item on the agenda this afternoon at 3 pm.

The meeting rose at 1.05 pm.
