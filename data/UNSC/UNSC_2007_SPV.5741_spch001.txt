The President (spoke in French): I would like at
the outset to welcome the new Permanent
Representative of Indonesia to the United Nations, His
Excellency Mr. Marty M. Natalegawa. Like all my
colleagues, I look forward to cooperating with him in
our work in the Council.

The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is
meeting in accordance with the understanding reached
in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them
document S/2007/542, which contains the text of a
draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's
prior consultations. I also wish to draw the attention of
members to document S/2007/539, containing a letter
dated 31 July 2007 from the Secretary-General
addressed to the President of the Security Council.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready
to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it
(S/2007/542). Unless I hear any objection, I shall put
the draft resolution to the vote now.

There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.

In favour:
Belgium, China, Congo, France, Ghana,
Indonesia, Italy, Panama, Peru, Qatar, Russian
Federation, Slovakia, South Africa, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America

The President (spoke in French): There were
15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been
adopted unanimously as resolution 1774 (2007).

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 10.15 am.
