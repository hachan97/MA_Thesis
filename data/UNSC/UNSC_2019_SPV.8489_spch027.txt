Mr. Danon (Israel): Unfortunately, the Council
can see what we are dealing with. It can have another
commission, another resolution and another empty
debate. In the end, in order to have a sustainable
negotiation, both sides need to speak directly, and
we deal with Egypt. Today, we celebrate the peace
agreement that we signed with Egypt 40 years ago. But
we found a real partner. When Sadat came to Jerusalem,
he said that he recognized Israel and that he was sitting
with us and negotiating with us. We can have another
committee. We are not against a commission to check
the incitement. We know the facts. They showed the
Council the books. The Security Council can check
the budget of the Palestinian Authority (PA). Seven per
cent goes to pay the families of terrorists. It should not
deny it. Mr. Mladenov is here. He can come and give a
report about the textbooks in Israel and in the PA, about
payments - it is paying the salaries of terrorists. We
are not against a commission but eventually, in order
to move forward, it is necessary to have a real direct
negotiation. That is the only way to move forward.
