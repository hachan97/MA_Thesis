Ms. Shilo (Israel): I feel compelled to briefly rebut
the accusations against Israel that have been made in
the course of today's discussions.

It was surprising to hear the Palestinian representative
talk about Gaza without once mentioning Hamas. The
facts could not be clearer. Hamas has fired tens of
thousands of rockets into Israel. Children in southern
Israel continue to live under the constant threat of
rocket attacks. Instead ofplaying outside, as all children
should do, they practice running to shelters in less than
15 seconds to save themselves. In Gaza, Hamas uses
schools and hospitals to store rockets and then fires
those same rockets at our schools for the purpose of
killing and maiming our children. By using Gaza's
children as human shields, Hamas intentionally puts
them in the front line.

On the other hand, Israel does its utmost to
minimize and protect not only our own children but
Palestinian children as well. Ignoring these crimes does
not favour the Palestinian children. Yet, again in this
Council, we have seen time and time again that blaming
Israel is easier than taking meaningful steps to improve
the situation on the ground.

Finally, if the Palestinian Authority is so eager
to find a peaceful solution, based on the two-State
principle, why did it form a unity Government with
Hamas, an internationally recognized terrorist
organization that voted for the destruction of the
State of Israel? The levelling of accusations against
Israel will not solve fundamental issues in the Middle
East and will not bring us closer to resolving the core
challenges facing our region. In fact, it only drags us
further away from achieving the peaceful future that
our children deserve.
