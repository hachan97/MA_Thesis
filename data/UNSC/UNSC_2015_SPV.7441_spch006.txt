Mr. Zhao Yong (China) (spoke in Chinese): I thank
Ms. Fatou Bensouda for her briefing.

China is deeply concerned about the continuing
deterioration of the situation in Libya. The most
pressing task now is for the concerned parties in Libya
to put national interests and the interests of their people
first, reject violence, take an active part in a United
Nations-led inclusive political dialogue and resolve
their differences through negotiation and consultation.
They must establish a national unity Government and
achieve a political settlement that takes into account
Libyan realities and the concerns of all of the parties,
with the aim of restoring stability and security in the
country. That is the precondition and the basis for
achieving judicial justice in Libya.

China's position regarding the International
Criminal Court is consistent and remains unchanged.
