Mr. De Riviere (France) (spoke in French): The
Security Council has just renewed the mandate of the
United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara (MINURSO) for an additional six months. That
was a good decision, for the United Nations Mission
continues to play a useful and stabilizing role.

France hopes that the coming months will be used
to the best advantage by the parties and the States of
the region to resume the path of dialogue and to find a
mutually acceptable political solution. In that regard,
the announcement by the Kingdom of Morocco
regarding future proposals is an important and
encouraging development.

Like the Secretary-General and his Personal
Envoy, to whom we reiterate our support, we believe
that direct negotiations offer the only credible prospect
for finding a way out of the impasse.

Lastly, we welcome the upcoming visit by a
mission of the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights. We call on all the
parties concerned to welcome it properly.
