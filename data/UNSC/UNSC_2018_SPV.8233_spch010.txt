Mr. Radomski (Poland): I would like to thank the
Secretary-General for his briefing.

Poland views the recent events in the context of
repeated chemical-weapons attacks against Syria's
civilian population as a consequence of the impunity
enjoyed by the perpetrators so far. The lack of an
appropriate response encourages a greater number of
attacks with the use of weapons that are both banned
under international law and blatantly inhumane. In
such circumstances the international community
cannot remain passive. It should take all the necessary
measures to prevent such attacks from being repeated
in the future, in particular against a defenceless
civilian population. At the same time, the competent
international bodies should take decisions that will
enable the perpetrators to be identified and brought
to justice.

We fully understand the reasons behind the action
taken last night by the United States, the United
Kingdom and France against Syrian chemical-weapons
capabilities. We support that action, as it is intended
to deter chemical-weapons attacks against the people
of Syria. Let me underline that it is the primary
responsibility of the Security Council to set up an
investigative mechanism to examine the use of chemical
weapons in Syria. In that context, we reiterate our
disappointment with the politically motivated Russian
veto on the proposal for establishing an independent,
impartial investigative mechanism on the use of
chemical weapons in Syria.

Poland will continue its international efforts aimed
at the complete elimination of chemical weapons. The
use of such weapons is unacceptable and should be
prosecuted vigorously in every instance and location in
which they are used. Poland calls for refraining from
actions that could escalate the situation.
